"wedding","2023-05-10","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-23T16:52:30","After a difficult two years of pandemic-enforced social restrictions, followed by an avalanche of long-delayed weddings, the bridalwear market is finally stabilising in 2023.  However the landscape is changing. Prospective brides are now looking for more than a one-occasion gown and are increasingly guided by the ability to rewear their look, opting for multiple options for longer celebrations, or procuring product through non-traditional methods such as rental and resale.  More is more  On many occasions weddings have evolved to multi-day experiences which begin with a rehearsal dinner on the eve of the wedding day, and extend to a post-wedding brunch the following morning.  The trend has made its way to the UK from the US, according to Annelise Sealy, founder of east London-based bridal retailer The Fall, which specialises in stocking contemporary and minimalist bridalwear and jewellery brands including & For Love, Solace and Galvan.  “Post-pandemic, British brides are after more than one bridal look - more in line with US bridal trends,” Sealy (below) tells Drapers.  Advertisement  This is due to brides choosing nuptials consisting of multiple events, allowing for “more scope than ever before to wear different looks”, according to founders of bridal brand The Own Studio, Jess Kaye and Rosie Williams:  “For a lot of our brides, it’s about finding the ‘main’ dress along with other pieces for the night before or day after and - of course - the all-important party look,” adds Kaye.  Megan Ziems, who founded Australian bridalwear label Grace Loves Lace in 2011, also notes consumers are “opting for two different [wedding] looks; one for their ceremony that is slightly more traditional, and a second for the reception which is more relaxed and fun but still bridal.”  The brand has designed different styles to cater with this in mind. Its bestselling style, the 'Goldie', is a minimalist, high-neckline silk gown which resembles the dress worn by the Duchess of Sussex to her wedding afterparty in May 2018.  “The trends our brides are favouring most are simple fabrics like our crepes and silks, high necklines, paired with a low back moment. [The] Goldie, has made its mark as one of our top-selling gowns due to its silk fabrication, high neckline, and low back detail,” says Ziems.  Advertisement  The demand for multiple looks is also evident in accessories. Founded in 2015 and specialising in cowboy boots, luxury footwear label Paris Texas recently expanded into bridal footwear with an exclusive collaboration with Browns (below) launched on 10 May.  “Weddings now run over multiple days with night-before dinners, the wedding day itself, followed by brunches the day after - meaning brides need multiple shoe options,” says Paris Texas founder and creative director Annamaria Brivio, who says brides are “searching for statement shoes with edge”.  Pre-wedding getaways have also provided an opportunity for businesses to expand into different categories such as bridal-themed swimwear, according to Boux Avenue chief design and product officer Zoe Price-Smith:  “A trend we are seeing more and more on social media with the bride wearing a white bikini or swimsuit, and her hens in either a black or pink swimwear piece, whether that is for a day sailing, or relaxing on the beach,” she tells Drapers.  A lasting commitment  The heightened demand for multiple wedding looks can be challenging to marry with following sustainable fashion practices and minimising clothing waste. However, this has resulted in a new opportunity for gown rental and re-wear, especially as budgets tighten amid the cost of living crisis:  “People are more conscious about their spend so we are seeing a lean into rental when it comes to second outfits,” says The Own Studio’s Williams. “Brides are also really keen to know that the pieces they have can be reworn, so for us it’s about offering luxurious pieces with versatility.”  This has prompted The Own Studio to offer its dresses through fashion rental mainstays such as Hurr and By Rotation. Others are tapping into the growing bridal rental market by launching wedding-focused platforms, including Something Borrowed and P.S. Bridal.  Launched on 13 April 2023 by former stylists Ella Gaskell and Zoe Graham, London-based P.S. Bridal allows brides to save at least two-thirds of the original wedding dress retail price by renting it for periods of seven, 14 or 30 days. Apart from savings, rental platforms offer shorter lead times while also allowing brides to customise their fit using reversible alterations for hems, waistlines, straps and sleeves. P.S. Bridal sources wedding dresses from brands and consumers alike, allowing brides to earn back the initial investment in their wedding dress purchase, while P.S Bridal takes a 40% commission. Rental pieces range from £24.38 for a week and £30 for a month for an Emmy London bow comb headpiece to £825 per week and £3,000 per month for an Oscar De La Renta floral appliqué tulle ball gown.  Dresses can also be resold to new consumers using a consignment service, such as in the case of bridalwear retailer The Fall, which launched its (Re)Cycle scheme in 2020 to offer a new lease of life for the traditionally once-worn garment.  “We automatically accept back anything purchased originally from The Fall at full price, and we consider any other submissions on a case-by-case basis,” the brand states on its website. Through the consignment service, the dresses and accessories can be resold for 40-80% of the original retail price, depending on the condition of the item. The Fall then takes a 20% commission, alongside VAT costs and processing fees from the selling price.  However, some brides opt to keep their dress and re-wear it for other occasions – with some adjustments:  “Many are opting to dye and tailor their pieces afterwards, so investing in silhouettes and fabrics suitable for dyeing [such as natural fibres: cotton, silk, linen and wool] are increasingly important to brides,” says The Own Studio’s Kaye.  Defying tradition  The Own Studio's customer base is also opting for versatile styles that can be reworn, with sales of the brand's wide-leg trousers increasing by 150% in the first five months of 2023. “This is set to be the year of deconstructed dressing with a huge uplift in requests for cool separates,"" explains Williams.  ""Brides love how separates allow them to change up their look from day to night with minimal effort, not to mention the added eco-benefit of being able to rewear [separates] long after the wedding day,” she adds.  Another way of minimising clothing waste – as well as wedding budget expenditure – is to purchase one rewearable gown which can be customised for different parts of the wedding celebrations with the help of removeable overskirts, separate sleeves, belts and bows, says The Fall’s Sealy. Accessories can also update a minimalist white slip dress to a more fashion-forward, trend-led outfit as brides look to invest in a staple piece.  Grace Loves Lace’s Ziems says: “One big shift we’ve noticed since pre-pandemic is a more minimalist style for their bridal look. Pre-Covid, we were still in a more is more era of bridal fashion, today there is a real demand for paired back styling and classic silhouettes.”  As more nuptials move out of churches and city halls into beaches, gardens and vineyards, defying traditional wedding expectations has become the new post-pandemic norm:  “A lot of the bridal and wedding rule book has been thrown out the window,” says The Fall’s Sealy says. “Brides now feel more empowered and less pressured by family members to choose something more traditional. My favourite post-pandemic trend is the number of brides now choosing a mini dress for their main look - pre-pandemic we never saw this.""  Ultimately, inflation and weakened consumer confidence has not dampened spirits among brides, who are still investing in new gowns, according to Grace Loves Lace's Ziems:  “Our research tells us that brides will sacrifice on almost every other element of their wedding except the dress,” she says.  Wedding dresses have long had a reputation for being the epitome of ""wear it once"" fashion. However, non-traditional post-pandemic trends and the rise of rental and resale solutions offer consumers savvy ways of saving on their big day - even if they do choose to prolong the celebrations.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRyYXBlcnNvbmxpbmUuY29tL2luc2lnaHQvYW5hbHlzaXMvd2h5LXRoZS13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzLXJ1bGUtYm9vay1oYXMtYmVlbi10aHJvd24tb3V0LW9mLXRoZS13aW5kb3fSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Kirsty McKillop, 34, a strategist who lives in Walthamstow, London, said she had experienced anxiety “on and off” throughout her life, but it became all-consuming during the Covid pandemic – particularly after going through a redundancy process at her previous job in PR, which knocked her confidence and made her question her self-worth.  She said she felt trapped in this “prison” that she had created in her mind and started “catastrophising” – she thought she would “lose everything in (her) life that she cared about”.  “I felt like I was basically being crushed by the dark and being suffocated by it and I couldn’t get out,” she said.  Kirsty decided to quit her job to look after her mental health, but then “everything went from bad to worse” as she started to experience debilitating physical symptoms.  She would cry every day, vomit, experience heart palpitations, have panic attacks, feel agitated and extremely restless, and lie awake in bed until the morning.  At her lowest point, Kirsty said she did not believe that she could get better, and she did not engage in “anything that might help her”.  However, with the continued support of her now-husband, Liam, 34, family and friends, she began engaging in therapy from December 2021 – and gradually over time she could “physically feel (her anxiety) lifting”.  She has since gone on to get married – something she previously did not think was possible – and go on her honeymoon to South Africa, and she now wishes to give the message that “life without anxiety is possible”.  “No matter what level of anxiety you’re feeling, it isn’t something that you have to accept as part of life,” she said.  “Whilst it is a natural human response, it’s not something you have to live with, and, going through therapy, it has just completely freed me from those feelings and I’m so much happier.”  According to the charity Mind, anxiety is a natural human response when we feel that we are under threat; it can be experienced through our thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations.  (PA Real Life)  Kirsty had experienced anxiety at varying stages in her life, but during lockdown, when her job was at risk, her mind was “swamped” with negative and “obsessive” thoughts, with everyday places and situations becoming “bleak and scary and threatening”.  While Kirsty did not lose her job, the redundancy process knocked her confidence, and her heightened emotions quickly spiralled into physical symptoms of anxiety.  She felt she was in “this constant state of panic” and started “overthinking everything”.  “I had really irrational thoughts that I was going to lose everything in my life that I cared about because I was not able to function day to day,” she said.  “I think, eventually, it did turn into depression, and then I had quite intrusive thoughts around not wanting to wake up if I did get to sleep.  “Not being able to sleep, not being able to eat, being sick, crying, feeling like I was having a heart attack, and feeling terrified of everything was really scary.”  Kirsty would lie in bed and try to “disassociate” from her anxiety, but her intrusive thoughts just kept “swirling around in her head”.  She then decided to quit her job in September 2021 “to give her the headspace” she felt she needed, but the lack of structure and routine in her life only made her anxiety worse.  “It had taken over my head so much that I could not think rationally – everything was like, I’m worried about holding down a job, therefore, I’m not going to be able to pay the mortgage, therefore, I’m going to lose the house, therefore, I’m going to lose my husband and all my friends, and I’m going to end up with nothing,” she explained.  (PA Real Life)  “Despite having incredibly supportive friends who would come and just be with me for hours, I still had that fear.”  Kirsty remembers a specific conversation where her parents and her then-fiance were discussing the wedding, and she thought: “This is ridiculous, there’s no way I’m going to get married in this state.”  By this point, she had started losing consciousness during the day and blacking out, and she had to cancel her hen do.  In November 2021, after moving back to her home town in Yorkshire, Kirsty’s family and friends encouraged her to seek professional support, as she was “stuck, trapped, in this completely different place”.  Kirsty’s loved ones had looked after her throughout this period and previously suggested she seek help, but she was not willing to engage as she thought “it’s not going to make a difference”.  She then started speaking to a therapist who was right for her in December 2021, and Kirsty said she was “pulled out of this horrible world”.  Through having sessions once or twice a week, and with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), Kirsty said she felt she was “becoming much more rational” as she started to “challenge” her thoughts.  The CBT focused on thinking about the facts, rather than “the feelings and the catastrophising” she had been experiencing, to try to “break the cycles of negative thinking”.  She said: “When that feeling starts to lift, you think, I can get better, and I want to get better.  “It’s not about fighting those thoughts, but accepting them and recognising they’re not facts.”  By February 2022, Kirsty started to feel like herself again – she stopped being sick, no longer had panic attacks, and was able to sleep.  In April, she started a new job as a strategist, which she now loves, and in July she married Liam and had “an amazing day”.  Looking back now, Kirsty said she “dreads to think where she would have been” if she did not start having therapy, and she is beyond grateful for the support she has received from her family and friends.  She does not want anyone else to go through the “absolute hell” she has, and wants to encourage more open dialogue and acceptance around mental health and anxiety, as she believes it “shouldn’t define you”.  “Anxiety is a natural response, but when it gets to the point where you’re having intrusive thoughts, or it’s affecting you physically, or it’s stopping you from doing things, that’s when it’s not normal and you shouldn’t accept it,” Kirsty explained.  “It’s not a state of well or unwell, it’s a state of always making sure you’re looking after yourself because life is always going to throw different challenges at you.”  She added: “I enjoy life so much more without letting anxious thoughts spoil my day-to-day life… and therapy has just allowed me to feel like myself and enjoy being myself.”  Kirsty is one of many who have offered quotes to inform and create a striking collection of AI art to shine a light on anxiety symptoms.  The artwork, from the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP), has been installed outside London Waterloo – for more information, visit www.bacp.co.uk/anxietyis.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2xpZmUtc3R5bGUvaGVhbHRoLWFuZC1mYW1pbGllcy9hbnhpZXR5LXdlZGRpbmctdGhlcmFweS13YWx0aGFtc3Rvdy1iMjM0MzkxMS5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It's also the ethos of its founders, GG and John Hanrahan, that lifts the Wallington experience from the realm of the ordinary into the magical. ""The fun aspect is the freedom,"" says GG. This statement perfectly resonates with their motto, ""Your Day, Your Way"".  Under the Hanrahans' thoughtful stewardship, The Barn Wallington has been transformed into an ideal blank canvas — an amalgamation of rustic grandeur and adaptability — allowing each couple to design their celebration in their own distinctive style. This unique blend of freedom and grandeur, encapsulated in a singular location, has led Bridal Musings to laud The Barn Wallington as one of the top 10 barn venues in the world.  Whether you're dreaming of a spectacular destination wedding or planning a versatile corporate event, The Barn Wallington emerges as the place where the exceptional is rendered possible. It offers an opportunity to partake in an extraordinary experience in the heart of the Bellarine Peninsula, and yet, just on the fringe of the thriving city life of Geelong and Melbourne.  Rural or urban, grand or intimate, traditional or unconventional, The Barn Wallington offers a world of possibilities. It's a barn wedding venue that radiates the magic of the Bellarine Peninsula, and like a great love story, it promises to be as enchanting as it is unforgettable. It's your day, your way, and it begins in Wallington.

"wedding","2023-06-25","19:00:00","{""Williamsport"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T09:00:00","Last June, Jay Comfort flew to the United States from his home in Switzerland to attend his only daughter’s wedding. But the week before the ceremony — on a Friday evening — Comfort said he found himself in “excruciating pain.”  “I tried to gut it out for three hours because of the insurance situation,” said Comfort, a retired teacher and American citizen who has Swiss insurance.  When the pain became unbearable, Comfort called his brother, who drove him and his wife, Nazuna, a few miles to the nearest emergency department, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center’s hospital in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.  Every bump of the drive was “like someone taking something and just jabbing it into my abdomen,” he said.  At the hospital, Nazuna Konishi Comfort handed over her husband’s Swiss insurance card, which confirmed coverage by Groupe Mutuel. Jay recalled the staff making copies of his insurance card and then treating his acute appendicitis. Doctors performed emergency surgery to remove the inflamed appendix.  Diagnostic tests confirmed he had a rare cancer, which doctors in Switzerland later removed with another surgery after he returned home. “It was a miracle,” Comfort said, adding that the cancer was completely removed.  After his appendectomy, Comfort recalled vomiting and then waiting in a recovery room. In all, he spent about 14 hours at UPMC Williamsport before being released. He attended his daughter’s wedding and, eventually, traveled back to Switzerland.  Then the bill came.  The Patient: Leslie “Jay” Comfort, 66, a retired educator who worked in Japan and Switzerland. Comfort pays a monthly fee and deductible for Switzerland’s mandatory basic health insurance, which he has with the Swiss-based Groupe Mutuel. His benefits — and the prices for procedures — are defined by the Swiss government.  Medical Service: Emergency laparoscopic appendectomy and diagnostic tests, which showed Comfort had a rare subtype of cancer called goblet cell adenocarcinoma.  Service Provider: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Williamsport, which is about 3½ hours northeast of Pittsburgh. The UPMC health system is one of the state’s largest employers, with 40 hospitals.  Total Bill: $42,156.50, covering emergency surgery, scans, laboratory testing, and three hours in a recovery room. His insurer has said it will pay him about $8,184 (7,260.40 in Swiss francs), which is double the procedure’s price in Switzerland. This left him to cover the remaining roughly $34,000.  What Gives: Although Comfort has health coverage, his Swiss insurance had no contract with the U.S. hospital where he underwent emergency surgery — or with any other provider outside Switzerland.  With what is considered an excellent health system, Switzerland has the highest prices for medical care in Europe. As in the U.S., the country relies on private insurers and hospitals. But the cost of care in Switzerland is substantially lower than what is charged in the U.S., so the reimbursement his insurer offered is a fraction of what Comfort owes the U.S. hospital.  “I’m trying to do the right thing and say I’m willing to pay my responsibility,” he said.  Groupe Mutuel does not have agreements with foreign providers, such as UPMC, and does not deal with them directly, said Lisa Flückiger, a spokesperson for Groupe Mutuel. The insurer originally agreed to reimburse Comfort what would have been paid in Switzerland for the same treatment in a public hospital and then double that because it was an emergency in a foreign country — a total of 4,838 in Swiss francs, or about $5,460.  While helpful, Comfort said, that amount wouldn’t pay off the $42,156.50 he owes UPMC.  UPMC has expanded its reach throughout Pennsylvania and is now the largest provider of care in many parts of the state. In 2016, it purchased a smaller health system and now runs two major hospitals, UPMC Williamsport and UPMC Williamsport Divine Providence Campus.  Studies show that in areas where hospital consolidation is high, prices go up. Because there is less competition, hospitals have more power to charge what they want when patients have private insurance or are paying out-of-pocket.  In the U.S., the amounts charged for medical care are “all over the map,” said Johnathan Clarke, vice president of strategy and business development at Penfield Care, a medical cost-containment company in Canada. The company negotiates medical bills on behalf of individuals, including international visitors to the U.S., but is not involved in Comfort’s case.  Clarke said he would expect an appendectomy to be priced between $6,500 and $18,800, based on his analysis of Medicare payments in the Pittsburgh area. Healthcare Bluebook — which evaluates insurers’ claims data to provide cost estimates based on what insurers have paid, rather than what providers charge — says a fair price for a laparoscopic appendectomy in Williamsport is about $14,554.  Comfort said a “reasonable price estimate” based on his own internet research would be between $7,500 and $12,000.  Comfort’s care included an X-ray and an EKG, or electrocardiogram for his heart, because “there was no information relating to past medical/surgical history for this patient,” wrote Susan Manko, vice president of public relations at UPMC. The staff also conducted pathology work that identified cancer.  But those additional services did not fully explain the gap between cost estimates and what the hospital charged. For instance, UPMC charged $8,357 for Comfort’s three-hour stay in the recovery room.  Manko said Comfort’s total bill aligns with UPMC’s standard charges.  The cost disparities highlight the stark difference in international pricing. Cost estimates last year showed the average amount paid for an appendectomy in the U.S. was “nearly exactly double” that paid in Switzerland, said Christopher Watney, chief executive of the International Federation of Health Plans, an industry association whose members include health insurers on six continents.  Health care in Switzerland, though, is often expensive compared with other European countries, Watney said. The Swiss pay double for an appendectomy compared with Germans, and more than three times that of those in Spain, he said. Across the globe, Watney said, many countries include an overnight stay in the cost of an uncomplicated appendectomy in contrast to Comfort’s experience, which was billed as outpatient care.  Comfort, who has dual residency in Switzerland and Japan after nearly three decades working abroad, said he worked in the U.S. long enough to qualify for Social Security benefits and Medicare. He said he had previously tried to gain Medicare coverage at one point but still is not enrolled, after being transferred to a couple of offices and “playing phone tag.”  Still, unlike many patients dealing with a five-figure medical bill, Comfort said he is not concerned about UPMC harming his financial reputation. The health system doesn’t “seem to put bad marks against people’s credit record — and I don’t have credit in the United States. I’ve been out for 30 years.”  Manko confirmed that, saying UPMC reviewed and updated its collection policy last year; it states the health system will not engage in “extraordinary collection actions” such as lawsuits, liens on homes, arrests, or reporting to credit agencies.  She said the health system — which, as a nonprofit system, is tax-exempt — maintains a “robust financial assistance program” for patients unable to pay. But “to our knowledge” Comfort has not applied for financial assistance, Manko told KFF Health News.  The Resolution: Comfort said he spent months waiting for a bill and finally reached out to UPMC because, if the bill had arrived this year, he would have had to pay his insurance deductible again on top of the charges.  Comfort received a full UPMC bill six months after his surgery. Manko said there was “confusion” at the time of Comfort’s ER registration. Comfort’s wife provided the insurance information, she said, “but there was no documentation in the patients record for address, policy number or policy holder information.”  Once Comfort received his bill, he realized it was much higher than his Swiss insurance reimbursement and, frustrated, contacted KFF Health News.  Flückiger said the original payment amount Comfort’s insurer calculated was by episode and did not include the scan or laboratory costs. After receiving questions from a KFF Health News reporter, Groupe Mutuel “realized that we have not included the laboratory analysis and the CT scan,” which are not routinely part of an appendectomy, Flückiger wrote.  After KFF Health News provided a detailed summary of the UPMC bill, the insurer increased the amount it would pay Comfort. In all, the insurer said, Comfort should receive 7,260.40 in Swiss francs, or about $8,184.  Comfort still hopes to negotiate directly with UPMC to reduce what he owes.  “I don’t want to try to walk away, saying I don’t owe you anything,” Comfort said. “That’s not right. We’re moral people, you know. But if you’re going to try to gouge me and play the power trip and think you’re going to try to get everything you can out of me, I won’t play that game.”  The Takeaway: Though the Affordable Care Act was meant to provide insurance to more Americans and bring down the cost of care, hospital bills remain extraordinarily high and highly variable.  For a nonemergency, Comfort could have tried to compare prices at other hospitals. But most hospitals in the area where he fell ill are owned by UPMC. And an inflamed appendix can’t wait for comparison shopping.  Clarke, the cost-containment expert, said the “only thing” Comfort could have done differently was to purchase a travel health insurance policy before leaving Switzerland. While prices for health care in continental Europe are comparable to Switzerland, the high cost of care in the U.S. means Groupe Mutuel insurance is “insufficient.”  That is especially important for visitors to the U.S. since, as Robin Ingle, CEO of travel insurance company Ingle International, said: U.S. prices are “kind of crazy numbers.”  Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and NPR that dissects and explains medical bills.

A bride's wedding day in Uttar Pradesh's Bareilly turned into an unexpected chase for her groom after he developed cold feet and refused to get married. Unable to accept that she had been spurned, the bride, dressed in her wedding finery, embarked on a chase over 20 kilometers to find the man and marry him.  When she was told that her groom, who she had been in a relationship with for two-and-a-half years, was not going to show up as she sat waiting for him at the mandap, she decided to go looking for him herself. Although he told her on a phone call that he had gone to bring his mother to the venue, she didn't believe him.  The groom was eventually found in a bus near a police station outside Bareilly city limits. After dramatic exchanges that lasted two hours, the bride, her family as well as the man's family took him to a temple.  The groom's family consented to the marriage and the two were wed at a temple outside Bareilly city. Videos of the ceremony show the groom in plain clothes go through the motions of the marriage ceremony as their families watched on.

The deceased have been identified as Shaji (40), Sreeja (38), and her children Sooraj (12), Subin (8), and Surabhi (6).  Preliminary investigation suggested that the couple killed the children before hanging themselves in Sreeja’s estranged husband Sunil’s house.  The children were found hanging from a staircase, while the couple was seen hanging from ceiling fans.  Shaji, who had a wife and two children, is said to have married Sreeja on 16 May.  The police said they were unaware of the marriage. “Sreeja was living with her lover. Now it is said that they got married but we are unaware of the details. But Sunil, Sreeja’s husband, said the house belonged to him,” Cherupuzha Station House Officer (SHO) Shaji MP told South First.  The incident came to light after their neighbours checked on them after the house remained closed on Wednesday. They alerted the police.  The police said the incident occurred on the intervening night of 23 and 24 May.  Family issues suspected  “We understand there were some family issues. I am now at the Pariyaram Medical College to complete the inquest procedures. We cannot confirm whether the deaths were suicide or not till we get the postmortem reports,” the SHO said.  The officer further said Sunil had complained on Monday, 22 May, that Sreeja and Shaji were illegally occupying his house. The SHO said the police visited the house and tried to de-escalate the issue.  “We could not evict the woman and three kids immediately. We asked all the parties concerned to come to the police station this week to resolve the matter,” the officer added.  Incidentally, Sreeja had told Sunil that she would commit suicide. However, the police came to know of it only after the tragedy.

'I've lived in France and I love it for, 'This is what we do, as this is the way we do it',' the former Newsnight presenter says.  'But, God forbid, if you break any rules, and, I think, Italy's the same . . . if you try and open a Thai restaurant or any different culture, there's actually quite a lot of push-back.'

Her pleated Batavia skirt, by the same brand, was even more pricey, at £1,650.  The 26-year-old has been cast as Kate Moss in the forthcoming film Moss And Freud, about the supermodel's friendship with painter Lucian Freud, who died in 2011 aged 88.

King Charles used to argue with his father every Christmas over whether William Shakespeare actually wrote his plays.  Prince Philip was a so-called anti-Stratfordian, a group who believe Shakespeare's canon was written by others.  The group includes Sir Derek Jacobi, the celebrated actor who, I can reveal, has signed up to a TV series that will question the authenticity of the playwright's work.  A source on the newly announced series, The Rosy Cross: The Rebels Who Wrote Shakespeare, tells me at the Cannes Raindance Filmmakers' party: 'Derek has signed up to join the production and we're discussing what role he'll be playing.

Previously, Emmerdale executive producer Jane Hudson teased that a familiar face would return to the village for one of two mystery weddings this summer.  The Sun has since revealed that one of these brides-to-be is Tracy Metcalfe, whose explosive return will see her walk down the aisle in a lavish summer wedding.  Soap star Amy is thought to have filmed her comeback scenes as she prepares to marry a mystery man upon her return to the Dales.  Tracy left the village last year with her baby daughter Frankie following the breakdown of her relationship with fiancée Nate Robinson (Jurell Carter) after he cheated on her and lied about it.  They were on the brink of reconciliation until she was offered a job in Nottingham to help other women with post-natal depression, which she also suffered from.

Cash is a common gift in Korea for various celebratory events like a baby's first birthday, Lunar New Year or weddings. For funerals, too, guests prepare cash in a white envelope to give to the grieving family.  However, with surging inflation in recent years, there has been upward pressure on the amount of money given as congratulatory or condolence gifts, leading many Koreans to face a dilemma of how much to spend on such occasions.  The best guideline, according to many Koreans, is the level of your relationship with the person who will receive the gift.  More specific guidelines could be found in the results of a recent online survey which asked 1,177 workers and university students for their opinions on the appropriate amounts for such cash gifts.  If a coworker you're not close with is getting married, the most appropriate amount to pay, 65 percent of the respondents said, is 50,000 won ($37), while 21 percent said 100,000 won would be ideal.  For a colleague with whom you frequently communicate outside office hours, 100,000 won was chosen by about the same percentage of respondents, while 50,000 was picked by slightly more than 20 percent.  The most preferred amount of congratulatory money for a close relative, friend or acquaintance was 100,000 won (36.1 percent).

Jamie Komoroski, 25, reportedly shrieked and moaned in recorded conversations from behind bars, discussing her future after being charged with crashing into the newlyweds as they left their South Carolina wedding reception in a golf cart-style vehicle last month.  Komoroski’s vehicle was travelling at 104km/h in a 40km/h zone when it struck the golf cart, according to Folly Beach director of public safety Andrew Gilreath  Watch the latest news and stream for free on 7plus >>  Samantha Hutchinson, 34, from North Carolina, died — still in her wedding dress — from blunt-force injuries sustained in the collision, according to the Charleston County Coroner’s Office.  Her new husband, now widower, Aric Hutchinson sustained two broken legs and broken facial bones, among other injuries. Two other family members were also injured in the crash.  Komoroski was charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm, court records show.  The reality of the charges was hard to swallow for Komoroski, who is reported to be struggling to accept both the devastating incident and the future that likely lies ahead of her.  Accused driver Jamie Komoroski has expressed her remorse in recorded conversations with family and friends from behind bars. Credit: Charleston Sheriff Office via CNN  She is being held in Charleston County jail where several conversations with friends and family were recorded, and later obtained by The Post and Courier through an open records request.  “Why me?” Komoroski asked in one recording, before describing the incident as a “freak accident” in another.  “Oh my God. I just can’t believe this happened to me,” she was recorded saying.  “I can’t believe this is my life ... my whole life is going to be over.  “I didn’t mean it to happen. I just feel like a terrible person, like, I didn’t mean for any of that to happen.  “I’m going to be here for years and years and years and years.  “I just pray and hope that the judge understands how regretful and remorseful I am and that I’m not a bad person and that I’ll never do anything bad again.  “I want it to be over.”  Komoroski’s father told her to “get tough” and “suck it up” in one of the recorded calls.  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller leave their wedding reception, moments before Samantha was killed. Credit: Go Fund Me  Komoroski is not the only one who could be held accountable over the incident.  A wrongful death lawsuit which the groom filed this month claims Komoroski visited the El Gallo Bar and Grill in Charleston before making her way to Folly Beach, where she began bar-hopping at several bars and restaurants.  She was served alcohol at all establishments — eventually reaching 0.261 per cent blood alcohol content level, despite responsible service of alcohol licensing restrictions in the state.  Komoroski was a new employee at a local restaurant, Taco Boy, and the lawsuit notes her supervisor is accused of organising and supervising a staff function “knowing that excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages would be purchased for, served to, and consumed by the employees attending the function”.  Taco Boy said no such employee function with a focus on drinking took place: “We can assure there was no such thing.”  Aric’s lawyer Danny Dalton said: “If this (lawsuit) stops one person from getting in their car while intoxicated, or helps someone have the courage to step up and stop that from happening, or helps an establishment really take a hard stand on over-serving people – that’s something positive that can come out of this.”  - With CNN and NBC","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovLzduZXdzLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lL3doeS1tZS1kcnVuay1kcml2ZXItYWNjdXNlZC1vZi1raWxsaW5nLWJyaWRlLW9uLXdlZGRpbmctbmlnaHQtY3JpZXMtcmVtb3JzZS1mcm9tLWphaWwtY2VsbC1jLTEwNzQ5ODkz0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vN25ld3MuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvY3JpbWUvd2h5LW1lLWRydW5rLWRyaXZlci1hY2N1c2VkLW9mLWtpbGxpbmctYnJpZGUtb24td2VkZGluZy1uaWdodC1jcmllcy1yZW1vcnNlLWZyb20tamFpbC1jZWxsLWMtMTA3NDk4OTMuYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

MANILA, Philippines — A wedding officially heralds a couple’s journey to forever. But getting there is a journey in itself—littered with many ups and downs, triumphs and sacrifices.  Perhaps the most stressful of all during the planning stage is the search for suppliers. As told by married couples themselves, they have faced disappointments and worse, last-minute changes and arrangements.  Then comes the event coordination on wedding day itself. This too, can cause anxiety if not perfectly executed.  Grand Hyatt Manila understands all this and aims to provide stress- and worry-free weddings for brides and grooms. Now, they can wed at a 5-star hotel and avail of a complete wedding package with event coordination by an in-house team of specialists.  Introducing Grand Weddings, the hotel’s signature, all-in-one wedding event service, that promises to remove the burden of searching for suppliers and to provide ease of mind on the wedding day itself.  Exceeding expectations  In the past, hotels usually serve as venues for wedding ceremonies and receptions.  Today, Grand Hyatt Manila is doing something revolutionary in the hospitality industry. Last May 6, it launched Grand Weddings to select guests, which included future husbands and wives themselves.  As part of the package, a couple clientele can have the most stunning and unique wedding venues in Metro Manila, and to be more specific, in the bustling Bonifacio Global City.  Imagine having an outdoor wedding with picturesque skyscrapers in the background at Garden Pavilion, followed by a reception at the Penthouse No. 66. Here, the most breathtaking 360-degree of Metro Manila and even Rizal and Laguna provinces can be seen. In fact, Grand Hyatt Manila is actually the tallest tower in the country.  Both venues are transformed based on three themes: the timeless all-white, charming rustic, or prettiest pastel. Whatever a couple clientele picks, the hotel’s team of specialists will work closely with them for their personalized styles and desires.  In-house florists also fill the venues with breathtaking arrangements from bouquets to centerpieces and other decorations.  “With Grand Weddings, the experience guests can expect is entirely different. Not only can they look forward to the hotel’s remarkable and unique event spaces, gastronomic concepts and exquisite menus created by our culinary team, or enjoy breathtaking views when they say ‘I do,’ our end-to-end wedding event services aim to eliminate the inconvenience and need for couples to liaise with several suppliers,” Gottfried Bogensperger, AVP and general manager of Grand Hyatt Manila, said.  Making dream weddings a reality  The curation continues with the gastronomic offerings that are unique to the couple’s palette. These are served in several courses, paired with an array of premium beverages—all created by the hotel’s creative culinary team.  And don’t forget the exquisite five-tier wedding cake from the hotel’s pastry kitchen headed by Nicolas Vergnole.  Come wedding day, brides and grooms can go about their personal preparations with complete peace of mind. Grand Hyatt Manila’s dedicated event specialists ensure that everything will go about smoothly.  The audio-visual requirements are state-of-the-art for the clearest sounds and the most creative lighting options to set the mood.  To complete the momentous day with an exciting reception, live entertainment is also provided, still suited to the couple’s preference.  After the grand wedding celebration, the now husband and wife can also enjoy a honeymoon experience within the hotel, which includes a special breakfast in bed with a bottle of bubbly, and a calming massage at Illume Spa.  By taking care of conceptualization, curation, planning, styling and coordination, Grand Hyatt Manila is indeed making dreams a reality for couples who will marry at the 5-star hotel.

Louis Antuwn Redmon, 23, was taken into custody May 17 in Jacksonville on charges of first-degree murder, armed robbery, armed carjacking, and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon in connection with the shooting death of Hershy Schwartz, NBC Miami, WPLG/Local 10 News and News4Jax reports.  Redmon, who was released from prison last September, is being held without bond, NBC Miami reports. It’s unclear if he has entered a plea or retained an attorney who can comment on his behalf.  Redmon is accused of fatally shooting 39-year-old Schwartz, a well-known member of his Orthodox Jewish community in South Florida, during what North Miami Beach police officials called an “armed carjacking gone wrong,” on Feb. 19, per the affidavit cited by WPLG.  Schwartz's fiancée, Rosie Brustowsky, told NBC Miami she is comforted by news of the arrest, but she added, ""That doesn't bring [Schwartz] back.""  Schwartz was reportedly a week from exchanging vows with Brutowsky in his home state of New York when he was found shot dead inside his car in the parking lot of a Miami Wendy’s, according to WPLG.  ""Our detectives believe Redmon targeted Mr. Hershy Schwartz to steal his car,” North Miami Beach Chief of Police Harvette Smith said during a Thursday press conference.  “But to put it simple, this was an armed carjacking gone wrong and they stole his life,"" the chief added. ""Fingerprint evidence and ballistic evidence is what linked Redmon to this crime. In addition, it was good, old-fashioned detective work.""  Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

After the fatal shooting, Redmon allegedly made phone calls and sent text messages to his apparent girlfriend, as well as her son — both of whom were jailed at the time — using Schwartz’s cell phone, according to the affidavit obtained by WPLG. The affidavit alleges Redmon told them about the deadly incident.  Following the February tragedy, Schwartz was remembered by friend friend Yehuda Kaploun as someone who “brought a smile” to everyone’s face, according to NBC Miami.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9oZXJzaHktc2N3YXJ0ei1ncm9vbS10by1iZS1raWxsaW5nLXN1c3BlY3QtYXJyZXN0ZWQtNzUwMTcyONIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-03-17","18:00:00","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:45:21","(WJW) — With the average cost of weddings continuing to break bank accounts across the country, it makes sense people would take note of a bride who found a sneaky way to cut costs on catered food.  Vlogger and TikTok creator Madison Mulkey recently revealed she spent just $1,950 on food for her 99 wedding guests — and she did it by getting Chili’s to cater the dinner.  “We loved the price point, I mean you really can’t beat that price point — you just can’t,” she told her TikTok followers in a viral video posted earlier this month. “It’s insane that we only spent that much money for our wedding food.”  The menu, Mulkey said, included chips, salsa, salads, egg rolls, chicken tenders, sliders, Cajun chicken pasta, and even five specialty meals for guests with dietary restrictions.  Mulkey and her family also offset the cost by picking up the food themselves instead of paying for delivery. And since her nuptials took place over a busy St. Patrick’s Day weekend, Chili’s could only handle the order at 11 a.m. — even through Mulkey’s guests wouldn’t be eating it until 6 p.m.  “So we had some time in there,” Mulkey explained. “We had to keep things cold and then we had to have our hired servers — who were really supposed to be cleaning, serving, preparing — really do a lot of the cooking … but everyone made it work, thank goodness.”  Their efforts paid off in the end, Mulkey claimed.  “The food was amazing and other people said so, too,” she said. “But they could have been lying to us.”  Mulkey’s video, which has been viewed over 1 million times on TikTok, has garnered praise from users who loved the idea and commended her creativity.

The Sister Wives star has shared her weight loss journey with her followers since her nasty split from ex Kody Brown.  5 Christine Brown is 'trying to lose 20 more pounds,' a source told The U.S. Sun Credit: Instagram/christine_brownsw  5 The Sister Wives star is shedding for her wedding to David Woolley Credit: david__woolley/Instagram  But now, more than ever, Christine's focusing on shedding more weight for her dream wedding, according to a source.  ""She works out every day. She's like super dedicated to the 'hot mom' comeback thing,"" a Sister Wives source told The U.S. Sun.  When asked how much she's looking to lose, the source revealed: ""Oh, probably 20 more pounds.""  ""She's happy with how far she's come and David thinks she's perfect.  ""So it's not like she's putting a lot of pressure on herself to lose more weight,"" the source continued.  ""I think it's more about how she wants to look in a wedding dress and, of course, cameras will be around.""  WEIGHT LOSS CONFESSION  The mom of six has made it known that she's soon going to be starting a six-week challenge with her Plexus followers.  She has been promoting the upcoming weight loss challenge on her Instagram, asking her fans to message her if they want to sign up.  She captioned a recent post: ""I get asked quite often - how did you lose all your weight? This little drink right here with a few others.  ""Google gut health & weight loss - you will see how it's ALL connected. It's pretty fascinating, actually. So I jumped on board and have been consistent since.  ""I choose these products because they get to the root of the issue, aka gut health = weight loss and better living.""  Christine, 51, is referring to the ""pink drink"" sold by Plexus, which is a dietary supplement that aids with weight loss.  The TLC star and her bestie Janelle have gone head-to-head, competing against each other in sales.  While it's unknown how much weight Christine has lost, The U.S. Sun reported co-star Janelle lost over 100 pounds.  TIME IS TICKING  The Utah native's upcoming challenge will be over before her summer wedding.  The U.S. Sun reported she's planning on having her dream wedding this summer, ""probably in July,"" before the kids go back to school in the fall.  A source claimed the nuptials will take place in Utah, where the newly engaged couple recently bought a brand-new $770K home.  ""It's going to be, from what I hear, really intimate and mostly close family,"" the source dished.  ""She's super close to her mom and obviously her kids will be there and his kids and their families.""  Christine has six children with ex Kody: Aspyn, 28, Mykelti, 26, Paedon, 25, Gwendlyn, 21, Ysabel, 19, and Truely, 13.  The family insider alleged that Kody will not be invited and that Christine ""really just talks to Janelle,"" so invites to Meri and Robyn are up in the air.  At the end of the day though, the reality star is a ""people pleaser"" and she's going to make sure everyone at the romantic ceremony is happy, not just her and David, the source claimed.  Christine got engaged to David in April after a low-key proposal that was filmed for cameras.  A source told The U.S. Sun that the wedding is also going to be filmed for the family's TLC reality show, or for a ""potential spinoff.""  PUTTING IN THE WORK  Given the newly engaged couple's wedding is a few months away, Christine has been as active as possible - appearing to achieve her daily steps - to get in shape for her wedding.  On May 12, she posted about walking her daughter Truely to school every day.  ""Walking Truely to school is one of my favorite things to do. The atmosphere in mornings is just breathtaking,"" she captioned a selfie.  A few days later, she shared memories from her hiking trip.  ""One of the reasons I love David so much! Truely was stuck on a hill and he climbed up to help her then patiently taught her how to climb down by herself,"" she captioned another post.  Finally, just this past weekend, she experienced Utah's nature even more by RZR riding with pal Janelle, who was in town visiting.  5 Christine and David are set to tie the knot in Utah this summer, a source told The U.S. Sun Credit: Instagram/christine_brownsw  5 Christine informed her fans that she's embarking on a six-week weight loss challenge ahead of her wedding Credit: Instagram/christine_brownsw","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE5MDM4Mi9zaXN0ZXItd2l2ZXMtY2hyaXN0aW5lLWJyb3duLWxvc2UtcG91bmRzLXN1bW1lci13ZWRkaW5nL9IBamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE5MDM4Mi9zaXN0ZXItd2l2ZXMtY2hyaXN0aW5lLWJyb3duLWxvc2UtcG91bmRzLXN1bW1lci13ZWRkaW5nL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-06-24","19:00:00","{""Williamsport"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T09:00:00","Last June, Jay Comfort flew to the United States from his home in Switzerland to attend his only daughter's wedding. But the week before the ceremony — on a Friday evening — Comfort said he found himself in ""excruciating pain.""  ""I tried to gut it out for three hours because of the insurance situation,"" said Comfort, a retired teacher and American citizen who has Swiss insurance.  When the pain became unbearable, Comfort called his brother, who drove him and his wife, Nazuna, a few miles to the nearest emergency department, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's hospital in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.  Every bump of the drive was ""like someone taking something and just jabbing it into my abdomen,"" he said.  At the hospital, Nazuna Konishi Comfort handed over her husband's Swiss insurance card, which confirmed coverage by Groupe Mutuel. Jay recalled the staff making copies of his insurance card and then treating his acute appendicitis. Doctors performed emergency surgery to remove the inflamed appendix.  Diagnostic tests confirmed he had a rare cancer, which doctors in Switzerland later removed with another surgery after he returned home. ""It was a miracle,"" Comfort said, adding that the cancer was completely removed.  After his appendectomy, Comfort recalled vomiting and then waiting in a recovery room. In all, he spent about 14 hours at UPMC Williamsport before being released. He attended his daughter's wedding and, eventually, traveled back to Switzerland.  Then the bill came.  The patient: Leslie ""Jay"" Comfort, 66, a retired educator who worked in Japan and Switzerland. Comfort pays a monthly fee and deductible for Switzerland's mandatory basic health insurance, which he has with the Swiss-based Groupe Mutuel. His benefits — and the prices for procedures — are defined by the Swiss government.  Medical service: Emergency laparoscopic appendectomy and diagnostic tests, which showed Comfort had a rare subtype of cancer called goblet cell adenocarcinoma.  Service provider: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Williamsport, which is about 3½ hours northeast of Pittsburgh. The UPMC health system is one of the state's largest employers, with 40 hospitals.  Total bill: $42,156.50, covering emergency surgery, scans, laboratory testing, and three hours in a recovery room. His insurer has said it will pay him about $8,184 (7,260.40 in Swiss francs), which is double the procedure's price in Switzerland. This left him to cover the remaining roughly $34,000.  What gives: Although Comfort has health coverage, his Swiss insurance had no contract with the U.S. hospital where he underwent emergency surgery — or with any other provider outside Switzerland.  With what is considered an excellent health system, Switzerland has the highest prices for medical care in Europe. As in the U.S., the country relies on private insurers and hospitals. But the cost of care in Switzerland is substantially lower than what is charged in the U.S., so the reimbursement his insurer offered is a fraction of what Comfort owes the U.S. hospital.  ""I'm trying to do the right thing and say I'm willing to pay my responsibility,"" he said.  Groupe Mutuel does not have agreements with foreign providers, such as UPMC, and does not deal with them directly, said Lisa Flückiger, a spokesperson for Groupe Mutuel. The insurer originally agreed to reimburse Comfort what would have been paid in Switzerland for the same treatment in a public hospital and then double that because it was an emergency in a foreign country — a total of 4,838 in Swiss francs, or about $5,460.  While helpful, Comfort said, that amount wouldn't pay off the $42,156.50 he owes UPMC.  UPMC has expanded its reach throughout Pennsylvania and is now the largest provider of care in many parts of the state. In 2016, it purchased a smaller health system and now runs two majors hospitals, UPMC Williamsport and UPMC Williamsport Divine Providence Campus.  Studies show that in areas where hospital consolidation is high, prices go up. Because there is less competition, hospitals have more power to charge what they want when patients have private insurance or are paying out-of-pocket.  In the U.S. the amounts charged for medical care are ""all over the map,"" said Johnathan Clarke, vice president of strategy and business development at Penfield Care, a medical cost-containment company in Canada. The company negotiates medical bills on behalf of individuals, including international visitors to the U.S., but is not involved in Comfort's case.  Clarke said he would expect an appendectomy to be priced between $6,500 to $18,800, based on his analysis of Medicare payments in the Pittsburgh area. Healthcare Bluebook — which evaluates insurers' claims data to provide cost estimates based on what insurers have paid, rather than what providers charge — says a fair price for a laparoscopic appendectomy in Williamsport is about $14,554.  Comfort said a ""reasonable price estimate"" based on his own internet research would be between $7,500 and $12,000.  Comfort's care included an X-ray and an EKG, or electrocardiogram for his heart, because ""there was no information relating to past medical/surgical history for this patient,"" wrote Susan Manko, vice president of public relations at UPMC. The staff also conducted pathology work that identified cancer.  But those additional services did not fully explain the gap between cost estimates and what the hospital charged. For instance, UPMC charged $8,357 for Comfort's three-hour stay in the recovery room.  Manko said Comfort's total bill aligns with UPMC's standard charges.  The cost disparities highlight the stark difference in international pricing. Cost estimates last year showed the average amount paid for an appendectomy in the U.S. was ""nearly exactly double"" that paid in Switzerland, said Christopher Watney, chief executive of the International Federation of Health Plans, an industry association whose members include health insurers on six continents.  Health care in Switzerland, though, is often expensive compared with other European countries, Watney said. The Swiss pay double for an appendectomy compared with Germans, and more than three times that of those in Spain, he said. Across the globe, Watney said, many countries include an overnight stay in the cost of an uncomplicated appendectomy in contrast to Comfort's experience, which was billed as outpatient care.  Comfort, who has dual residency in Switzerland and Japan after nearly three decades working abroad, said he worked in the U.S. long enough to qualify for Social Security benefits and Medicare. He said he had previously tried to gain Medicare coverage at one point but still is not enrolled, after being transferred to a couple of offices and ""playing phone tag.""  Still, unlike many patients dealing with a five-figure medical bill, Comfort said he is not concerned about UPMC harming his financial reputation. The health system doesn't ""seem to put bad marks against people's credit record — and I don't have credit in the United States. I've been out for 30 years.""  Manko confirmed that, saying UPMC reviewed and updated its collection policy last year; it states the health system will not engage in ""extraordinary collection actions"" such as lawsuits, liens on homes, arrests, or reporting to credit agencies.  She said the health system — which, as a nonprofit system, is tax-exempt — maintains a ""robust financial assistance program"" for patients unable to pay. But ""to our knowledge"" Comfort has not applied for financial assistance, Manko told KFF Health News.  The resolution: Comfort said he spent months waiting for a bill and finally reached out to UPMC because, if the bill had arrived this year, he would have had to pay his insurance deductible again on top of the charges.  Comfort received a full UPMC bill six months after his surgery. Manko said there was ""confusion"" at the time of Comfort's ER registration. Comfort's wife provided the insurance information, she said, ""but there was no documentation in the patients record for address, policy number or policy holder information.""  Once Comfort received his bill, he realized it was much higher than his Swiss insurance reimbursement and, frustrated, contacted KFF Health News.  Flückiger said the original payment amount Comfort's insurer calculated was specifically for the appendectomy and did not include the scan or laboratory costs. After receiving questions from a KFF Health News reporter, Groupe Mutuel ""realized that we have not included the laboratory analysis and the CT scan,"" which are not routinely part of an appendectomy, Flückiger wrote.  After KFF Health News provided a detailed summary of the UPMC bill, the insurer increased the amount it would pay Comfort. In all, the insurer said, Comfort should receive 7,260.40 in Swiss francs, or about $8,184.  Comfort still hopes to negotiate directly with UPMC to reduce what he owes.  ""I don't want to try to walk away, saying I don't owe you anything,"" Comfort said. ""That's not right. We're moral people, you know. But if you're going to try to gouge me and play the power trip and think you're going to try to get everything you can out of me, I won't play that game.""  The takeaway: Though the Affordable Care Act was meant to provide insurance to more Americans and bring down the cost of care, hospital bills remain extraordinarily high and highly variable.  For a nonemergency, Comfort could have tried to compare prices at other hospitals. But most hospitals in the area where he fell ill are owned by UPMC. And an inflamed appendix can't wait for comparison shopping.  Clarke, the cost-containment expert, said the ""only thing"" Comfort could have done differently was to purchase a travel health insurance policy before leaving Switzerland. While prices for health care in continental Europe are comparable to Switzerland, the high cost of care in the U.S. means Groupe Mutuel insurance is ""insufficient.""  That is especially important for visitors to the U.S. since, as Robin Ingle, CEO of travel insurance company Ingle International, said: U.S. prices are ""kind of crazy numbers.""

Sophie branded guests who changed their RSPV at the last minute “rude” and joked she had been forced to call upon her “B-list” friends.  During the pre-wedding chat between Sophie and Jamie, Radio 1 DJ Jamie told Sophie how he was “nervous” and “intimidated” ahead of delivering his groom’s speech “in front of two hundred people.”  But Sophie was quick to calm his nerves in her own way, telling her husband: “No, it’s not two hundred people, because so many people are pulling out left, right and centre. Rude.” She added: “Not fair. I’ve got my B-list coming. Jokes.

Vlogger and TikTok creator Madison Mulkey recently revealed she spent just $1,950 on food for her 99 wedding guests — and she did it by getting Chili’s to cater the dinner.  “We loved the price point, I mean you really can’t beat that price point — you just can’t,” she told her TikTok followers in a viral video posted earlier this month. “It’s insane that we only spent that much money for our wedding food.”  The menu, Mulkey said, included chips, salsa, salads, egg rolls, chicken tenders, sliders, Cajun chicken pasta, and even five specialty meals for guests with dietary restrictions.  Mulkey and her family also offset the cost by picking up the food themselves instead of paying for delivery. And since her nuptials took place over a busy St. Patrick’s Day weekend, Chili’s could only handle the order at 11 a.m. — even though Mulkey’s guests wouldn’t be eating it until 6 p.m.  “So we had some time in there,” Mulkey explained. “We had to keep things cold and then we had to have our hired servers — who were really supposed to be cleaning, serving, preparing — really do a lot of the cooking … but everyone made it work, thank goodness.”  Their efforts paid off in the end, Mulkey claimed.  “The food was amazing and other people said so, too,” she said. “But they could have been lying to us.”  Mulkey’s video, which has been viewed over 1 million times on TikTok, has garnered praise from users who loved the idea and commended her creativity. One viewer even claimed she catered her own reception with Chipotle, while another said she was inspired to “get Olive Garden” to provide the dinner for her own wedding.  “Normalize this!

I loved that she paired this pretty long veil with this dress because it was such a soft color and contrasted the shimmery gold dress. It gave rose gold, but separate.  Even her bridesmaids took a different route for their dresses. One woman had on an olive green dress, another woman had on a pink dress, and another had on a purple dress.

In the viral video posted on TikTok, musician Deshawn Harris explains that he faced a dilemma when he noticed his friend’s behaviour and advised him against “messing up” his marriage.  “My homeboy got mad at me, and now he ain’t talking to me, because we were in the club and wanted to talk to these women but he’s married,” Deshawn explained to the camera.  “I told him to cut that out.”  The musician recalled that his friend became defensive at the accusation, but Deshawn reiterated that so many people had invested – their time, love and money – into the wedding, that it would be a waste for everyone involved if he was to cheat on her.  “I didn’t spend all my money on your wedding to watch you come into this club and start cheating on her and mess this all up,” Deshawn said, recalling the conversation to his followers.  He added: “I ain’t tell you to walk down this aisle, ain’t tell you to introduce me to this woman and get this ring on her finger.”  Deshawn continued, adding that he also has loyalty to his friend’s wife since he considers her a friend.  “I’m not gonna lie to this woman,” he said.  Deshawn concluded that his advice to his friend was to get a drink and sit down.  “You better go and sit down somewhere because I spent too much money on your wedding,” he joked.  Viewers of the viral clip agreed, with one writing: “Exactly... if you’re gonna cheat why am I spending on your wedding. I could’ve stayed home.”  Another added: “Real friends hold you accountable. We need these types of friends.”  “Facts! What did he get married for if he wasn’t ready to get married,” commented another.  Viewers seemed to agree on how “expensive” friends’ weddings can be, and to end the marriage early on would be a “waste”.  “I need a minimum of 10 years of marriage due to the amount of money I spent on their weddings,” joked one viewer about the cost of their friends’ weddings.  Other followers, however, were left divided over why Deshawn made a public video about the events when his friend could be easily identifiable among his close circle.  “LOVE this energy. Hate that he made a public video,” wrote one viewer.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vbWFuLWNhbGxzLW1hcnJpZWQtZnJpZW5kLWZsaXJ0aW5nLTA4MTgyMDAyNS5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL21hbi1jYWxscy1tYXJyaWVkLWZyaWVuZC1mbGlydGluZy0wODE4MjAwMjUuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If you heard it and thought it’d make a good wedding song, well, Lauren says she unexpectedly found out it definitely is.  Lauren tells ABC Audio a couple of her songwriter pals told her that writing a song people want to play at their wedding is the ultimate for a writer. “They were talking about, ‘Once you get a wedding song, that’s it … you have made it. The wedding song is the thing you didn’t know as a songwriter that you always wanted.'”  “And I kind of chuckled. And I had already written ‘Thank God I Do.’ We’d already recorded it,” she continues. She says, a few weeks later, “I was showing it to a friend who was getting married in like two or three weeks … And I look over and tears are filling his eyes. I was like, ‘What?

"wedding","2023-05-25","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T22:55:37","Chrishell Stause knows she’s evolved since Season One of “Selling Sunset,” the Netflix reality show that follows the agents and owners of a luxury L.A. real estate firm.  Six seasons and many confrontations later, she knows who she is — and it shows.  “I’m just at a different stage in my life, and there’s going to be things that I’m no longer willing to put up with. That being said, I don’t think you have to lose your softness either … there’s just a balance and a blend, and finding that balance is a beautiful thing,” Stause tells TODAY.com.  Take a moment during Episode Three of the recent season, when Stause spars with new cast member Nicole Young at a beachside brokers’ open. In past seasons, she might have simmered before confrontation. This time, though, she’s swift and to the point.  “You give me this energy, I’ll give you this all day back. Don’t go on about the real me. You don’t know me,” Stause tells Young.  She’s banking on audiences knowing, and trusting, the “real her.”  Between seasons, Stause let audiences in on her budding romance — and now marriage — to the Australian musician G Flip, as well as her sexuality journey. Previously, she was married to the actor Justin Hartley and dated Oppenheim Group co-owner Jason Oppenheim (their relationship was detailed on Season Five).  TODAY.com caught up with Stause about this season in the show and in her life.  Chrishell Stause at her desk at the O Group. (Netflix)  Her ‘spur of the moment’ wedding to G Flip  On May 9, Chrishell Stause broke the internet, or at least her corner of it, when she posted an Instagram Reel featuring clips of her and G Flip (the stage name of Georgia Flipo) with the caption, “Love doesn’t always go as planned … sometimes it’s immeasurably better.”  The last photo in the reel showed the pair at an altar, confirming they privately tied the knot in Las Vegas.  Speaking to TODAY.com, Stause says the wedding was “a spur of the moment decision” kept secret by her and G Flip’s loved ones before and after the big day.  G Flip and Chrishell Stause (Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images)  “The focus was on us and what it meant to us, and that is exactly the way we wanted it. We didn’t want to stress about details. We just wanted to have fun and have the meaningful part between us. But then obviously, now we can celebrate with our friends and it’s nice to be able to share,” she says.  Only a few people attended the intimate ceremony. In fact, Stause says that none of her “Selling Sunset’’ co-stars were physically there, but “some of them” watched via a virtual livestream.  “Everybody has their own way of doing things that works for them, and this works for us,” she says.  ‘Camera time’ was at the heart of her with conflict with Nicole Young, Stause says  Controversial cast member Christine Quinn may be gone — but peace did not reign in “Selling Sunset” land. Stause and co-star Nicole Young’s season-long spar begins during a beachside brokers’ open in Episode Three and just keeps growing.  During their first interaction, Young accuses Stause of “taking credit” on a co-listing they shared three years prior; Stause replies by saying she didn’t take a “single dollar” off those commissions.  Stause says Young’s actions towards her were “very strategic, wanting to come in and make a splash and get a lot of good camera time.” She says they had a “great relationship” before Young joined the show.  “You’re gonna see me so thrown by that because I really hate that fakeness … being one way before we film and another way now all of a sudden. Does it make for great television? One hundred percent because I genuinely am really frustrated by that kind of stuff,” Stause says.  (L-R) Nicole Young and Chrishell Stause in season 6 of  During a later confrontation, Stause says Young is “on drugs,” which Young denies. A day after their confrontation, Young gets a drug test to prove her sobriety.  Stause says she “regrets lashing out” at Young, but “doesn’t regret standing up for (herself).”  “At the point that I really kind of lose it, there had been so many things thrown at me to get a rise out of me. So when she finally does get one, could I have handled that better? One hundred percent. But can I also look at that and be like, ‘Yeah, I’m human. If you keep barking in my ear, one day I’m going to bite you back,’” Stause continues.  All in all, Stause says audiences will see the pair “go through a journey.”  “At the end of the day, I do hope that we all are successful, we want to all be proud of something and build each other up. So I’m hoping that’s where we can land … it’s quite a bumpy ride to see if we’ll get there or not,” Stause says.  She has ‘genuine love’ for Mary Fitzgerald  Throughout Season Six, Stause also navigates a new chapter with her friend Mary Fitzgerald. In the wake of her breakup with Jason Oppenheim, Stause felt Fitzgerald gave Oppenheim more attention. Fitzgerald and Oppenheim are exes, too, adding to an already complicated workplace dynamic.  Although Season Six seemingly shows distance between the two, Stause tells TODAY.com that “nothing would ever come between my genuine love for Mary.”  “I feel like she’s one of the girls that no matter how much time has passed, I don’t feel like we’d ever wish anything but the best for each other,” Stause continues.  “It sometimes can be frustrating to work on a show and do things where it’s in the better interest to not have his talk off camera and make sure we have those conversations on camera, but I think that it does a disservice to an obvious love that’s there,” Stause says.  Is Bre Tiesi really Christine Quinn’s successor?  This season, Stause is in the middle of one conflict and is a close onlooker to another: Chelsea Lazkani and newcomer Bre Tiesi. Lazkani weighs in on Tiesi’s relationship with Nick Cannon. The pair have a child together but are not in an exclusive relationship. Cannon has 12 children with six women.  “It really stresses me out because I’m really good friends with both of these ladies, and I love them dearly,” Stause says. “Do I agree with everything that was said? Absolutely not. But we’re on a show where we are being asked our opinions and things like that. So I think that it’s tough.”  Stause likens filming the show to “walking through a landmine and just trying as hard as you can to make it through.”  Fans have drawn comparisons between Tiesi and Stause’s former co-star Christine Quinn, who departed “Selling Sunset” after last season. Stause isn’t sold.  “I think people say that because Bre is so beautiful and she’s got the fashion. If you don’t know Bre, then yes, you could easily make that correlation because obviously, as we know, Christine is beautiful and she always had the fashions. With that being said, I actually think they’re opposite otherwise personality wise,"" she says.  Stause says she’s moved on from Quinn. “It’s such old drama. I literally don’t have any ill will (towards Christine), I wish her the best. I think everybody’s kind of moved on, and I think that’s great.”  Chrishell clarifies her future with the Oppenheim Group  The final moments of Season Six show Stause and Fitzgerald debating over Stause’s future involvement at the Oppenheim Group. She indicates she’d like to take a step back.  Stause says she isn't leaving the show, but is prioritizing herself.  Chrishell Stause and G Flip in season 6 of  “I think it’s OK to be honest, where it’s like, I’m not out looking for new clients, I have a list that I’m happy with. And obviously I’m super happy in my personal life. When we started filming this season, (real estate) wasn’t my main focus, and that can always change,"" she says.  If she could tell a younger version of herself anything, Stause says it would be: “Trust your instincts. Don’t second guess yourself, and if you get it wrong, that’s OK, too. You can come back from that, but really, lean in. Stop leaning back.”  This article was originally published on TODAY.com","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vY2hyaXNoZWxsLXN0YXVzZS1yZXZlYWxzLXNlbGxpbmctc3Vuc2V0LTIyNTUzNzY0My5odG1s0gFVaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2NocmlzaGVsbC1zdGF1c2UtcmV2ZWFscy1zZWxsaW5nLXN1bnNldC0yMjU1Mzc2NDMuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-06-03","22:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-24T00:09:45","Saturday, June 3rd will mark a cause for celebration as outdoor wedding and event venue Northview Gardens celebrates its 10-year anniversary. Located in Selwyn Township just north of the Peterborough city limits, Northview Gardens is a hidden oasis on County Road 19 between Chemong Road and Hilliard Street that locals have lovingly labelled ‘the secret gardens’.  Tucked behind an unassuming sign and trees and down a narrow road, you’ll find a lush garden of greens and perennials, an outdoor ceremony area with a natural wooden archway, a 150-seat reception hall, an AGCO-licenced rustic outdoor patio and bar, a cozy garden house, and everything else needed for a picturesque wedding or special event.  Though this is what the property looks like now, it wasn’t the original plan for the space when owners Rose Farthing and David Quist purchased the property over two decades ago.  We're big gardeners so we were drawn to the two and a half acres of garden space. Rose Farthing Northview Gardens  Tweet this quote  “We bought the property basically a fixer-upper,” Rose says. “We’re big gardeners so we were drawn to the two and a half acres of garden space. It was a beautiful location and we wanted to make a nice home.”  Everything changed for the husband-and-wife duo years later when the couple’s niece asked if they would host her wedding. It was an intimate family-only wedding that led to a massive change for Rose and David.  “At the end of the night, that little voice on my shoulder said ‘You should do this, Rose.’ And the following week I was at the township office asking what comes next.”  The whole theme is really whimsical vintage. All the settings on the grounds are meticulously placed. Rose Farthing Northview Gardens  Tweet this quote  After starting small by using temporary tents to host weddings and events, Rose says the “real fork in the road” was when the couple found their tents “blown to smithereens” in an afternoon storm. Rose and David had two options: go big or go home.  They decided to go big. In 2012, Rose quit her day job and the couple began construction on their 2,000-square-foot venue. All the unique finishing touches, from the ceremony grounds to the iron carriage and double swing, continued to expand from there.  “The whole theme is really whimsical vintage,” Rose explains. “All the settings on the grounds — all the white iron, the glass tops, and every cushion — are meticulously placed.”  On June 3, 2013, Northview Gardens held its grand opening and Rose and David have never looked back.  Joking that David calls her “headquarters,” Rose explains she and David have very different roles in the business: she’s the creative one who envisions the ideas, and David is the handyman who brings them to life.  “We make a really great team,” she says.  For a while, Northview Gardens was a full family affair, with the couple’s son Nigel the venue’s original bartender. While Nigel has since moved on to other things, the business has continued to grow and succeed thanks in part to the venue’s dedicated staff.  “I have really good and strong staff that are proud of what we’re doing,” Rose says. “I have a working network of people, including bartenders and housekeepers, that I’m very grateful for. They make Northview Gardens what it is today.”  After 10 years of hosting other people’s events, Rose and David will finally be holding their own celebration from May 26 to 28 to thank everyone who has contributed to Northview Gardens’ success over the past decade, from vendors and contractors to friends and past and future clients.  We want to show our gratitude. It's our way of giving back and saying look at how far we've come. Rose Farthing Northview Gardens  Tweet this quote  “We want to show our gratitude,” Rose says. “It’s our way of giving back and saying look at how far we’ve come.”  With an invited guest list of close to 300 people, the three days of anniversary celebrations represent the past, present, and future of Northview Gardens.  Kicking off the celebrations on the evening of Friday, May 26th will be an invite-only VIP event for the contractors, builders, vendors, friends, family, and others who have collaborated and worked alongside Northview Gardens throughout the last decade. The evening will begin from 4 to 7 p.m. with sliders and appetizers cooked on the barbeque and live music by Peterborough singer-songwriter SJ Riley, before the dance floor opens up for live music from local blues musicians Al Black and the Steady Band from 7 to 10 p.m.  On Saturday, May 27th, the venue will be hosting the future bride and grooms who have already secured their wedding dates at Northview for the 2023 or 2024 seasons. The day will begin with a brunch and charcuterie from Lisa’s Catering, one of Rose’s long list of local vendors, while DJ Shawn Hurd will provide on-site music all day long. Then, throughout the afternoon, the venue will be set up like an open house, allowing the guests to browse samples and vendors.  “The room and ground will all be staged at that point to just really awaken their ability to see what their wedding’s going to be like,” Rose says.  For the final day of celebrations on Sunday, May 28th, Rose and David have invited couples from the past decade to return to Northview Gardens. With help from long-time sponsor 96.7 Oldies, on-air personality Roger Ashby will be on hand to provide an afternoon of entertainment.  I really prioritize supporting the community where I can. Rose Farthing Northview Gardens  Tweet this quote  “We’ve made some nice connections with couples and their families,” Rose says, explaining that some former brides have already shown excitement at seeing how the venue has changed since their own wedding.  As Northview Gardens has since first opening, Rose and David continue to support other local businesses during their anniversary weekend celebrations.  “I really prioritize supporting the community where I can,” says Rose, noting that pieces from Katherine’s Flower Shop, a new floral shop in Bridgenorth, will be on display for the weekend.  In the future, Rose and David plan to use their beautiful venue to offer even more support back to the community. Once a month or so, they hopes to host live music events to give a stage to local performing artists.  Though she’s already planning the next 10 years, Rose holds closely all the memories of the previous decade. One of her most memorable moments, she recalls, was hosting a Habitat for Humanity event with royalty in attendance. As an ambassador for the organization, Canadian Autumn Philip — the wife of Queen Elizabeth II’s oldest grandchild Peter Philip — spoke at the event.  “I met royalty right here at Northview Gardens,” Rose says, joking that she always kept the house tidy since that day in case the Queen herself stopped in for a visit.  The important thing for us is making sure we create lasting memories for people. Rose Farthing Northview Gardens  Tweet this quote  Even when Northview Gardens isn’t catering to royal dignitaries, Rose is grateful for all the couples she has been able to support. Couples have come from across Canada and from around the world — including England, Europe, Australia, India, Pakistan, South Korea, and South America — to celebrate their special day. She recalls a couple who drove five days from the Yukon to have their wedding, without ever having seen Northview Gardens in person before.  “The important thing for us is making sure we create lasting memories for people,” Rose says, adding their three-day anniversary celebrations are sure to do the same. “This is one of those proud moments where we get to look around at what we’ve accomplished and see the kind of support we have. I’m just so grateful.”  While Northview Gardens is primarily a wedding venue, they also host other special events including life celebrations, parties, milestones, anniversaries, corporate events, vow renewals, photo shoots, and more. The venue, including the grounds and gardens, are also available for artists, church and community groups, and local entrepreneurs and businesses for their event needs.  Northview Gardens is located at 994 County Road 19 in Selwyn Township. For more information, call 705-768-9742, email celebrate@northviewgardens.ca, or visit northviewgardens.ca.

Daniel Webbe held his June 30, 2022 wedding at a winery owned by the 50th Parallel Estate Limited Partnership near Vernon.

Webbe, however, told tribunal member Megan Stewart that 50th Parallel hadn’t proven it sustained damage allowing it to keep the $3,150.  “It also says it lost business revenue well above the amount it withheld, as the confetti rendered the hall unusable for some time after the wedding,” Stewart said in her May 23 decision.  Stewart said it was undisputed that there was a prohibition on confetti at the winery and that the cannons were fired.

The students played the parts last week to help them understand marriage ceremonies, one of several Christian rites of passage they are studying for religious education.  Pupils were assigned roles for the mock wedding, which took part at St Oswald’s Church on Upper Brook Street, Oswestry and was conducted by Reverend Cranston.

Their teacher, Kallista Skelton said: “I was immensely proud of how much effort the children and their parents made with finding suitable outfits for the entire wedding party along with bouquets and buttonholes, they looked wonderful.  “A lot of children have never been to a wedding, especially after all the restrictions which existed during Covid, so it was lovely to be able to get them really involved in the process.  “It sparked some really interesting conversations about things such as the role of a best man, and if he should give away any secrets about the groom in his speech!""  Bellan House headteacher Claire Belk said: “Our school motto is that we learn not for school but for life and this is a great example of how the two things come together in a fun way.  “Rather than just reading about a ceremony, the children were able to take part in a mock one, which they might even find themselves doing for real at some point in the future.  “Miss Skelton went above and beyond to help the children engage with the topic, even making a wedding cake for the bride and groom to cut and all the children to try at the reception, which was held in the classroom after the ceremony.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaHJvcHNoaXJlc3Rhci5jb20vbmV3cy9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjAyMy8wNS8yNC95ZWFyLXR3by1wdXBpbHMtZ2V0LWhpdGNoZWQtaW4tbW9jay13ZWRkaW5nLWNlcmVtb255LWF0LW9zd2VzdHJ5LXNjaG9vbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In the 1990s as a homeless teen, West said, she didn’t dare to think beyond “getting through just one more day.” Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight She said she found hope, though, in an unlikely place, when an employee at a White Castle restaurant handed her several bags of free hamburger sliders after she asked for a glass of water.  “After that, whenever I was hungry, I knew where to go,” recalled West, now 41. “Every White Castle I went to treated me the same way. I’d come out from washing in their restroom and I’d find a big bag of sliders waiting for me.”  “It was a kindness I’ll never forget,” she said.  About 25 years later, when she became engaged to Drew Schmitt, West said she knew exactly where she wanted their wedding: a White Castle that had recently opened in Scottsdale, about 20 miles from where they live.  Advertisement  “We’ve eaten here at least twice a month since they opened,” West said of the 2019 opening, adding that White Castle allowed them to use the restaurant for their wedding at no charge.  On May 5, she and Schmitt said their “I do’s” at a medieval-theme ceremony that included stacks of sliders for 150 guests, a giant burger-shaped cake and flower girls who threw dehydrated onions instead of flower petals.  West wore a bright-blue and gold ball gown with a full skirt, and Schmitt suited up in a kilt topped with custom-made leather armor. To continue with their royalty theme, the couple wore crowns as a tattoo artist put the finishing links on the Celtic ring tattoos they’d chosen instead of traditional wedding rings.  “We’re so thankful that we found each other and have become each other’s partners and best friends,” said Schmitt, 57, who runs a roofing company with West.  “Jamie has been through a lot of tough challenges in her life, so it’s wonderful that she’s now in this happy place,” he said.  West said she grew up in Arizona and was put into the state’s foster-care system when she was 4 because her parents struggled and could not care for her.  “Over eight years, I was in and out of 94 foster homes — some of them were really abusive and neglectful,” she said. “When I was 12-and-a-half, I finally climbed out a bathroom window to run away, and I got good at hiding.”  She said that she formerly lived with other teens at a homeless camp near Arizona State University in Tempe, then hitchhiked to Southern California and lived in beach communities with counterculture members of the Rainbow Family.  Advertisement  “When I got tired of that, I started hitchhiking all over the country,” West said. “It was pretty rough — I was abusing alcohol and drugs and I was truly on my own.”  She was 16 when, she said, she walked into a White Castle restaurant for a glass of water one day in one of the many nameless towns she’d wandered through. She does not remember exactly where she was, she said, but she believes she was in Kentucky or Tennessee.  “This woman working there said, ‘Oh, Sugar, you poor thing — go get yourself cleaned up in the bathroom,’” she recalled. ""I went in there and cried, then washed up. When I came out, there were these big sacks filled with slider hamburgers waiting for me.”  “The lady told me they were cleaning the grill and were going to throw everything away and she wanted me to have them,” she added. “I remember sobbing, then hugging her and grabbing the food and running away.”  “I wasn’t sure whether it was real,” West explained.  She said that scenario happened repeatedly at various White Castles across the country, no matter how rough-looking she was when she walked in.  Advertisement  “I was always so grateful to them for treating me like a human being,"" West said. ""It was a shiny spot at a very bad time.”  When she was 17, West said, an aunt in Arizona took her in for a year and she was able to stop abusing illegal substances and begin to live a more stable life.  “She helped me to leave that street mentality I’d been locked into,” said West, noting that she eventually found a job as a kennel technician at an animal shelter and was able to move out and find a place of her own.  There were no White Castles in Arizona at the time, but when she traveled to states that had the burger chain, she would make it a point to stop by, and was happy to pay for her food now that she could afford it.  Although her mother died five years ago, West said, she was recently able to reconnect with her father and is hoping to repair their relationship.  Advertisement  “Drew is the one who inspired me to do that,” she said of her husband.  She said it took years to put her painful past behind her, but she finally found love and acceptance after meeting Schmitt near Scottsdale in 2006.  “We were both dating other people who were football fans, and we were all together at a bar one day watching a game,” West recalled. “After our relationships broke up in 2007, Drew and I started dating.”  When White Castle opened its first location in Arizona in 2019, they camped in the parking lot to be the first in line to go inside, and they have since become regulars.  In March 2020, Schmitt asked West to marry him after they were both inducted into White Castle’s Cravers Hall of Fame at the burger chain’s headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, during a gathering for the company’s biggest slider fans. West decided to publicly tell the audience about her difficult past and her history with the restaurant chain.  Advertisement  “Jamie was onstage telling her story, and when she turned around, I was on one knee with a sword, asking her to marry me,” he said. “It was pretty epic.”  The coronavirus pandemic caused them to delay their wedding plans, but the wait was worth it, West said.  As she walked up the aisle to the music of Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’,” “I thought about all of the strangers who helped to feed me and got me to this moment,” she said of her wedding.  “I want other girls out there who are going through what I went through to know that it’s going to get better, and they can find hope,” West added. “I was able to break free of the pain and be happy, and they can too.”  GiftOutline Gift Article","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvMjAyMy8wNS8yMy93aGl0ZS1jYXN0bGUtd2VkZGluZy1ob21lbGVzcy10ZWVuL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When it comes to rocking an incredibly stylish dress, Jennifer Aydin knows how to slay.  How to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Bravo Tuesdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo App.  We recently caught up with The Real Housewives of New Jersey cast member when she attended New York City’s Gotham Ball on May 10 with fellow RHONJ ladies Danielle Cabral, Dolores Catania, and Jennifer Fessler. For the fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel, Jennifer opted for a sexy, sleek style, wearing a Michael Costello x Revolve Maxi Dress in taupe ($188, shown here in black). She paired the curve-hugging look with Christian Louboutin peep-toe heels and carried the Fendi First Small bag ($3,290) in black leather and python.  Jennifer returned to retailer Revolve for a fiery red wedding guest dress and took to her Instagram Stories on May 22 to share the outfit details. In the photos, the brunette beauty posed in a crimson-colored gown by Cinq a Sept ($693) that featured spaghetti straps, a structured bodice, a bow accent on the hip with ruffle detailing, and an asymmetrical hem that showed plenty of leg. Jennifer accessorized the red-hot style with sparkly red strappy heels by Rene Caovilla, a silver sequined handbag by Cult Gaia ($428), and sterling silver and Swarovski crystal Tracy earrings by John Michaels Jewels ($445).  Jennifer posts a photo of herself in a red floor-length dress, sparkly red heels, and a silver shoulder bag to Instagram Stories.

In one Instagram Story, the mom of five snapped an adorable selfie with her husband, Dr. Bill Aydin, who attended the affair in a dapper black suit with a white button-down shirt and black tie.  Jennifer posts a photo of herself and Bill at a wedding to Instagram Stories.

For the sit-down with her castmates, Jennifer tapped the Estrada Twins (the East Coast duo who also designed her Season 12 gold sequined number) for an elegant long-sleeved blue gown. The gorgeous sheath featured bejeweled embellishments and a sheer side train flowing from her right shoulder. Jennifer stayed true to dripping-in-designer form with a pair of Chanel logo earrings.

Earlier in May, the New York native had some additional R&R when it came to a “small” cosmetic procedure performed by her plastic surgeon husband, Bill, ahead of Mother’s Day.  In a series of Instagram Stories, Jennifer divulged the details of the surgery and her recuperation process.  “Just checkin’ in. I had surgery yesterday. Nothing bad, just a small procedure, ’cause I guess I’ve lost a lot of weight, and I had some loose skin on my love handles,” she explained. “Bill, from Aydin Plastic Surgery, he cut off my loose skin that was [on] my love handles.

"wedding","2023-05-18","14:00:00","{""Chelsea"", ""UnitedStates"", ""female""}","2023-05-23T23:02:00","Wedding dresses are often a single-use garment, with many brides thinking of the gown hanging, unworn, in their wardrobes with regret.  At the Chelsea flower show, which is on this week, one grower has attempted to solve this problem by weaving biodegradable wedding dresses out of the roots of wheatgrass.  Zena Holloway, who makes the designs, created the sustainable material after spending years as an ocean photographer and witnessing plastic pollution.  She said: “I saw the growing amount of plastic in the ocean over the years and became upset about the materials we were using.”  Holloway hopes her work will inspire others to use sustainable, biodegradable materials. Photograph: Jim Powell/The Guardian  After growing mushrooms in her basement, she became fascinated by the mycelium – the root-like structure of a fungus – noticing “how it grew into the substrate and the roots, and how it joined up to form new materials. And then I was in the river doing a river cleanup with my camera and through the lens I saw bright red willow roots that were growing into the water.  “And because my head was in that place, thinking about the binding property of roots, or binding of mycelium, the penny dropped.”  Holloway began growing roots at home to understand “how it might mesh together and how it could be a new material”.  She grows wheatgrass over different materials, such as corals and beeswax, so it will adopt the shape of the natural moulds. When enough roots have grown, she treats it with beeswax, to give it a natural strength. The resulting pale, twisting material looks ethereal, like bleached coral.  “The concept for this dress,” Holloway said, “is a sustainable wedding dress. If they got married by the ocean, for example, she could sustainably trash the dress and … get in the water and all the fish would just eat it, and it would just become part of the ocean.”  Holloway hopes that her work will inspire others to use sustainable, biodegradable materials. The fashion industry is responsible for between 2% and 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions but despite pledges to curb emissions, according to the World Resources Institute the sector’s environmental footprint is expected to grow by 60% by 2030.  The flower show, put on by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), is focusing more than ever on sustainable growing, with gardeners tasked with demonstrating how their work is eco-friendly. For the first time, every garden has to have a relocation plan for after the show, rather than being thrown in a skip.  There is a competition for sustainable gardening product of the year, which this year has been won by Lindum Wildflower Turf, the first to be grown without plastic matting. Its compost is peat-free and recycled and it supports a range of pollinators and insects with its 27 species of wild flowers, perennials and herbs, all native to the UK.  After last year’s drought, there has also been a focus on resilient plants, with the Chelsea flower show plant of the year accolade awarded on Monday to the deep purple agapanthus black jack, which is heat and drought tolerant and favoured by pollinators.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjMvZWNvLWRlc2lnbmVyLXNob3dzLW9mZi1iaW9kZWdyYWRhYmxlLXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3MtYXQtY2hlbHNlYS1mbG93ZXItc2hvd9IBfmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAyMy9tYXkvMjMvZWNvLWRlc2lnbmVyLXNob3dzLW9mZi1iaW9kZWdyYWRhYmxlLXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3MtYXQtY2hlbHNlYS1mbG93ZXItc2hvdw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2020-10-06","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","2023-05-23T18:44:31","Penny Evangelakos and George Alafogiannis’s together forever began as a story of teenage love, when they started dating in 2009. They grew up in the same neighbourhood and had been acquainted with each other for a long time, but it wasn’t until they were out with mutual friends and formally introduced that love bloomed.  “It’s becoming quite rare for a couple to be together from such a young age for so long, and we’ve been fortunate to see each other grow and celebrate so many milestones in our lives,” says Penny. “We’ve seen each other graduate high school, graduate college, have no sense of direction for a couple years, kind of figure things out, and cautiously step into adulthood. I love that we can now admire how much progress we’ve each made since we were teenagers.”  George proposed to Penny in February 2020 during a trip the couple typically take every year to New York City to celebrate Penny’s birthday. In addition to the regular roster of activities the couple loves to do in the city—eat at great restaurants, shop and get lost in some of their favourite neighbourhoods—there was an engagement in the mix, an event Penny admits she didn’t see coming.  “Nothing on that day felt out of the norm, which is what made it so special,” she reflects. “We were walking through the streets of the West Village amidst the beautiful brownstone homes, and it was surprisingly quiet on that morning. It was there George got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.”  For their dream day, Penny and George hosted a three-day event in Sicily at an extraordinary rustic-luxe venue: Dimora dell Balze. Set among the olive trees and rolling hills of the Iblea Valley, it was originally built in 1886 and boasts a rich history as well as breathtaking architecture and vistas at every turn. Everything about the space and property is cinematic.  “One of the main reasons we chose Dimora as our venue was the picturesque location, which blends the estate with the Sicilian countryside,” says Penny. “The natural beauty of the landscape provided a romantic and idyllic setting for celebrating love.”  As the backdrop was so naturally perfect, the couple didn’t need to bring in much in terms of decor, and what they did choose was subtle and complimentary to the venue. The colour palette for the day was inspired by the natural beauty of the Sicilian countryside and featured a fusion of earth and clay tones mixed with soft rose pastels. The florals for the day were verdant and unbridled with a naturally lush ceremony installation and reception table pieces.  The couple hosted 33 guests for their wedding weekend. For the main event, Penny and George said their “I dos” in a very personal ceremony set against the entrance of their venue. “This will forever be such a special moment to us; it was the most meaningful part of the day” says Penny. “We exchanged our own vows, and our officiant, Loredana, did a beautiful job personalizing the readings to fit our story. George and I were traditional and didn’t see each other before the ceremony—the first time he saw me was walking down the aisle.”  A cocktail party on the impeccably manicured gardens of the estate followed the ceremony, and the couple loved the chance to mix and mingle closely with every guest who travelled to celebrate with them. “Our band was amazing and filled the garden with Sicilian sounds while we enjoyed local wine and hors d’oeuvres, overlooking the views of Noto’s famous golden hills,” says Penny.  Alfresco dinner and dancing followed in the giardino d’inverna section of the venue, a space surrounded by ancient stone walls and rustic details. Guests were seated at one long harvest table in the space, which was lit up after dark by single light strands draped across the courtyard. The band played throughout dinner, and then the party switched gears for dancing with a DJ who kicked things off with the couple’s first dance to “Beyond” by Leon Bridges.  “We danced under a full moon in the crisp early autumn air,” Penny says. “Once that DJ started playing, everyone started dancing and we didn’t stop until the early hours of the morning!”  Highlight reel  Select standouts from Penny and George’s big day  The dress  “I had a clear vision of what I wanted my dress to look like,” says Penny. “I wanted it to feel timeless, romantic and elegant with a contemporary edge. I’ll never forget the day I found it. Andrea, the owner of White Toronto, messaged me and said they had a dress in a little early for a Berta trunk show and she had a dress she wanted me to check out. The moment I put it on, none of us spoke, we just knew.”  The band  “Creating the right vibe and energy through music was important to us,” says Penny. “We knew we wanted a live band for most of the day, and we wanted original and traditional music that drew inspiration from Southern Italy and the Mediterranean area. We had the Sicilian folk band Domo Emigrantes play an acoustic set throughout our ceremony, cocktails and seated dinner. They played the accordion, violin, tambourine, and guitar, and as a special detail for us brought the bouzouki to tie in a bit of Greek tradition. We really appreciated how engaged they were with George and I, calling us over to serenade and sing specific songs to us, always ensuring we were enjoying and taking in the music together.  The intimacy of the event  “Because our wedding was so small and personal, we were not only able to interact with each guest and truly enjoy their company, but we had so many moments to ourselves to take everything in,” says Penny. “Our wedding planners and photographer were great at pulling us aside every so often so we could do that. Our first real moment alone was after the ceremony—our photographer, Giuseppe had us walk around the boardwalk of the dramatic views over Noto’s golden hills. He told us to just talk and pretend he wasn’t there… he’d bring us a drink every so often.”  Penny and George’s Wedding Directory  Wedding dress: Berta from White Toronto  Shoes: Amina Muaddi  Groom’s tuxedo: Suit Supply  Hair & makeup: Brittany Sinclair  Flowers: Intrecci di Fiori e D’arte  Stationary: Paula Lee Calligraphy  Music: Domo Emigrantes  Photography: Giuseppe Marano  Venue: Dimora delle Balze","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhla2l0LmNhL3dlZGRpbmdzL3dlZGRpbmctcmVhbC13ZWRkaW5ncy9wZW5ueS1ldmFuZ2VsYWtvcy1nZW9yZ2UtYWxhZm9naWFubmlzLXJlYWwtd2VkZGluZy_SAWhodHRwczovL3RoZWtpdC5jYS93ZWRkaW5ncy93ZWRkaW5nLXJlYWwtd2VkZGluZ3MvcGVubnktZXZhbmdlbGFrb3MtZ2VvcmdlLWFsYWZvZ2lhbm5pcy1yZWFsLXdlZGRpbmcvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But how much does it cost to have a wedding in Wisconsin?  Wedding site The Knot released its 2022 Real Weddings Study to determine the average cost of a wedding in each U.S. state. The 2022 national average cost of a wedding is $30,000 which is reportedly a $2,000 increase from 2021’s national average.  The cost listed includes the ceremony and reception and does not include the engagement ring. A wedding in Wisconsin reportedly costs $26,000 on average. Which is about the middle of the pack.  The lowest average is $16,000 which is shared by three states (Kansas, Oklahoma and Utah). While the highest average is in New Jersey, coming in at a whopping $51,000.  Those thinking about doing a destination wedding can expect things to normally be slightly more expensive than hometown events. This is mainly due to the cost of travel, accommodations and other expenses.  The Knot also breaks down the average wedding budget — not including honeymoons. The five biggest expenses are venue, live bands, florists, photographers and videographers.  The average American cost for these are:  Reception venue – $11,200  Live band – $3,900  Photographer – $2,600  Florist – $2,400  Videographer – $2,100  Additionally, the average cost of catering is about $75 per person. The study showed that the average wedding guest count was 117. This was an increase from 2021, which had an average of 105.  The information was released on February 2023.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlYXJlZ3JlZW5iYXkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9ob3ctbXVjaC1kby13ZWRkaW5ncy1jb3N0LWluLXdpc2NvbnNpbi_SAVlodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZWFyZWdyZWVuYmF5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvaG93LW11Y2gtZG8td2VkZGluZ3MtY29zdC1pbi13aXNjb25zaW4vYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Event organiser Peter Stetina called it “fun and wild” for the pro women’s field, the only category with a cash prize at the second-year event that was filled with a who’s-who of Unbound Gravel contestants.  Sarah Sturm was the fastest on the 69-mile course at Stetina’s Paydirt in Carson City, Nevada, completing the three timed segments in 2:35:57. Heather Jackson crossed the line 16 seconds later, but then erased the deficit completely and moved into first place by a four-second margin after demonstrating accuracy in the tyre toss - where riders literally throw a bike tyre around a life-size cutout of Stetina from a distance - netting a 20-second time bonus in the Shimano Women’s Challenge.  “While I feel so bad for Sarah, these were the rules that we set ahead of time. She was disappointed, she’s a competitor. It’s just the way it happened to shake out this time. We’ll revisit how the time bonuses are allocated, but everybody was very into the shenanigans at the finish line and kept it lighthearted. I believe there is a space to have fun, and keep it competitive. Both Sarah and Heather are the utmost professionals,” Stetina told Cyclingnews.  “The underlying theme is that it is a race and an adventure. You put a number on for a reason - to go hard. But it’s not everything. There are ways to go hard and have a more fulfilling experience across the board, so the Paydirt is a result of that. I think we’ve kind of struck silver,” added Stetina with a tip to the Silver State.  Sturm could have countered for additional bonus seconds in the mechanical bull challenge, which earned a brave rider one bonus second for each second staying in the saddle. However, the results were finalised after the tyre toss, as the bucking bovine was minus his sting due to technical difficulties.  While shenanigans are a signature part of Stetina’s Paydirt, the serious side handed out a $5,000 cash purse to the top five overall women for the Shimano Women’s Challenge.  Flavia Oliveira Parks, who won the 2022 Paydirt, was third in the overall. Paydirt rookie Anna Yamauchi finished fourth while last year’s runner-up Lauren Cantwell took fifth.  “In all honesty, the biggest congrats to Sarah for such strong riding as well as all the other women. We came here to get in a hard effort in a fun, relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere ahead of Unbound and it couldn’t have been better,” Jackson posted to her social media after nailing the IRC Tire Bike toss.  The men’s field competed for bragging rights, last year’s third-placed Levi Leipheimer taking the top honours with a ride of 2:20:29. Finishing two-and-a-half minutes later was Stephen Flynn, who outsprinted Harrison Biehl by four seconds. Stetina did ride and finished 10th in the men’s 35+ category.  Stetina said operating his own race is like planning your wedding, which becomes a fulfilling experience despite the endless emails and requests from participants, juggling a new set of twins with his wife and creating re-route options for a flooding river. A late course adjustment in the opening 8 miles was put in place because of heavy snowmelt in the Pine Nut mountain range that caused the Carson River to rise to minor flood stage. There were no changes to the timed segments.  “It’s a passion project, it’s mayhem,” summarized Stetina. “Paydirt is not for me, it’s for everyone else. You’re trying to please people to the nth degree, which is what I feel like your wedding is, you know? You get to the end of it and say, ‘what just happened?’ Paydirt was such a success. It’s a breath of fresh air in the ever-more competitive gravel world.”  His second edition of Paydirt also comes just two weeks prior to Unbound Gravel, his biggest race of the calendar, “the big show”. He has been on the podium twice, second in 2019 and third in 2021, then finished eighth last year.  “That is my glaring unchecked box,” Stetina said about a win in Emporia, Kansas in the 200-mile event. “I’ve had a lot of victories, and It’s getting harder to win. I'm very motivated for it. But I also have to take a step back and realize, you know, I'm going to do my best. And I would love to put my name in the hat of contenders.”  When asked about the other contenders in two weeks’ time, Stetina was quick to mention the women’s field.  “I can say both Heather and Sarah are looking very primed and ready for Unbound. They both are very, very good right now.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN5Y2xpbmduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL3BldGVyLXN0ZXRpbmEtcGF5ZGlydC1pcy1hLXBhc3Npb24taXRzLW1heWhlbS1pdHMtbGlrZS15b3VyLXdlZGRpbmctZGF5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I’m going to be here for years and years and years.”  PAST COVERAGE:  In another call, Komoroski said what happened was a freak accident.  “It was just like a freak accident, obviously; I didn’t mean it to happen,” she said.  While in tears, Komoroski expressed her regrets over the calls that were obtained through a public record request by the Post and Courier.  “I just pray and hope that the judge understands how regretful and remorseful I am and that I’m not a bad person and that I’ll never do anything bad again,” she says.

Presented by new Amherst Historical Society member Mariah Rogers, a former seamstress for David’s Bridal, the presentation led guests through a visual history of what is considered quite possibly the most popular gown.  “While dresses that we have here today span through the 20th century, the bridal dress as we know her today, really starts more so in the middle of the 19th century,” Rogers said.  Donning an authentic 1978 wedding dress, the 24-year-old historian continued on the lesson of bridal history including the reason why the gowns typically are white.  “Many think that the bridal gown of today has a history of being white because it symbolized purity,” Rogers said. “While that certainly has become the case for many, the real reason that the gowns are white is because they are modeled after Queen Victoria and her white gown.”  According to Rogers, Queen Victoria settled for a white gown simply because the color matched her complexion.  “During the early days of the wedding dress, fashion trends would spread through illustration, no differently than if you were to see a cute dress today that a model is wearing,” she said. “When Victoria debuted her white wedding gown, it was also during the advent of photography, so the image and following trend spread quickly.”  Rogers continued by explaining how as time went on, different decades opted for different designs from the short playful wedding dresses of the 1920s and 1930s, to the conservative sweetheart necklines in the 1950s, and eventually, the large sleeves of the late 1970s and 1980s.  “The point of this presentation is not to begin a new trend of the wedding dress, but to rather show her history and how to align with the history of women,” she said. “When in times of war, the wedding attire may have been military uniforms, versus in times of peace, it was something that reflected on childhood.”  Accompanying her presentation, three volunteers modeled different types of dresses seen, all of which were donated to the Amherst Historical Society.  “The presentation and tea has just been amazing,” said Sandy Kaiser, executive director of the Amherst Historical Society. “We deeply appreciate the help and support from the community to continue to expand history.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vcm5pbmdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL2FtaGVyc3QtaGlzdG9yaWNhbC1zb2NpZXR5LXByZXNlbnRzLWhpc3Rvcnktb2YtdGhlLXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3PSAW9odHRwczovL3d3dy5tb3JuaW5nam91cm5hbC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9hbWhlcnN0LWhpc3RvcmljYWwtc29jaWV0eS1wcmVzZW50cy1oaXN0b3J5LW9mLXRoZS13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Friday, crews responded to a call of black smoke at the Moreland Mansion. Once on scene, crews found no fire or smoke, only water coming from the interior sprinkler pouring onto the floor below.  Kirtland Fire Chief Tony Hutton said crews quickly shut off the system. He noticed a group of well-dressed visibly worried evacuees who informed him a wedding and reception was set to begin with little time to spare.  “They were all pretty frantic, almost in panic mode that this wedding was going to take place,” said Hutton. “We all looked at each other, and we said we can do this.”  Accustomed to saving the day, why not save a wedding? Firefighters grabbed towels, wet dry vacuums, and mops to quickly help clean up the mess. Finishing with just 15 minutes to spare before celebrations were planned to begin.  “We were glad we could help them too we see all kinds of different things, and it was nice to help them out and make their day special the way it should have been,” said Killeen.

Then you should consider hosting a forestcore wedding. This whimsical and rustic wedding aesthetic is inspired by the unique ambience created by a woodland setting. ""There’s a reason the magical forest is the setting of so many stories,"" shares wedding planner Jason Mitchell Kahn. ""Forests are places where you can get lost in, and that inherent beauty allows your guests to get lost in both the love story of the wedding and the nature surrounding it.""  If you are hoping to host a wedding in or inspired by the woods, then you should definitely think about what elements of nature you will want to incorporate into your wedding aesthetic. ""Think about what you might find in the forest and try to use that throughout your concept,"" explains Manda Worthington, owner and creative director of Mae & Co. Creative. ""Leaves and lush foliage from trees can be used in your table setting arrangements. Maybe incorporate a campfire and create an interactive s’mores experience. Think about how beautiful the stars are at night and use that to come up with a lighting installation over the reception seating.""  0:39  How to Plan a Forestcore Wedding  Dreaming of a forestcore wedding? Start by choosing the right color palette. Worthington shares that earth tones of browns, hunter green, navy blue, and asphalt gray are ideal options for a forestcore wedding. ""Don't try to make the forest anything it's not,"" she shares. ""Don’t fight it. Lean into the surroundings and focus on enhancing the beauty of the space you're choosing to get married in instead of changing it."" Wedding planner Jacqueline Hallgarth adds that you should look to how the foliage changes throughout the year before choosing your grounding hues for décor. ""You always want to consider the natural seasonal surroundings,"" she says. ""For example, a fall wedding in the woods will have autumnal foliage throughout. It’s important to coordinate these color tones in the other design elements—such as floral and stationery—so the wedding design is intentional and cohesive in a woodsy setting.""  For unique elements to include at your nuptials, Hallgarth notes, ""When guests think of a woodsy wedding, they can’t help but go back to fond childhood camp memories. Depending on the venue, I would lean into this theme and elevate it by incorporating local seasonal flowers, providing spiked apple cider and hot chocolate, and [planning] fun guest activities such as a morning polar plunge and hiking."" Kahn chimes in that you can channel the whimsicality of the forest for a unique guest experience. ""Most of us don’t regularly spend time in forests, and the very nature of them being a bit mysterious allows you to go in any direction. If possible, create an unexpected path to get to the ceremony location. It builds the mystery of what lies ahead,"" he suggests.  Photo by Emmy Lowe  Forestcore Wedding Fashion and Beauty  Your wedding day fashion and beauty can also reflect this natural and whimsical aesthetic. Consider suits in deep greens and ethereal dresses with lace and long trains to wear down the aisle. Then, you can enhance a natural beauty look with soft florals in your hair or a crown with leaf motifs.  Photo by Jenn Emerling Weddings  Forestcore Wedding Venues  Hallgarth advises that if you are taking guests into the woods, you should prep them in advance. ""For a wedding immersed in nature, it’s important to share thorough details on the wedding website with your guests so they can be prepared and comfortable on the event day. Relating to attire, it's essential to note the ground conditions, which will determine appropriate footwear, such as a chunky heel in lieu of stilettos,"" she shares. The planner also advises to consider the high altitude of many forest locations. ""For a summer wedding, always have water and sunscreen available for your guests,"" Hallgarth says. ""It's also important to note this to the bartenders, especially if the guests are traveling and not accustomed to alcohol consumption in a higher elevation.""  A final word of advice? Be wary of uninvited guests. ""This might be a simple one to overlook if you don't spend a lot of time in the forest on a day-to-day basis, but when you are in the forest, you are in the wilderness,"" says Worthington. ""There will be bugs and there might be animals. Keep bug spray nearby for your guests and at the end of the day, just embrace nature.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vZm9yZXN0Y29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLXBsYW5uaW5nLXRpcHMtNzQ5OTUxNtIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""CapeTown"", ""WesternCape"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-23T22:20:43","One curious Reddit user recently asked people to detail times guest objected to couples tying the knot, and readers flooded the replies with a variety of scandalous stories of weddings gone wrong. Enjoy reading these wild tales, as well as conversations we had with Jack Burns, Editor at Bespoke Bride , and Kathy and Danielle, Editors at The Wedding Playbook , and be sure to upvote the stories that you would have paid money to witness!  Not all wedding ceremonies include an opportunity for guests to object, but when they do, it's usually because the couple is confident that everyone present supports the union. Occasionally, however, all hell breaks loose when the officiant utters this phrase…  “Should anyone present know of any reason that this couple should not be joined in holy matrimony, speak now or forever hold your peace…”  #1 I wanted to pay a local actor to burst in into my wedding, shout ""I object! I love the bride!"" and then we each pull swords and sword fight up and down the aisle. In the end I would win and the ceremony would wrap up as planned.    My wife did not think this idea was awesome so we just had a regular wedding instead.  #2 I had a friend who was a minister, and the subject came up if he asked the question during ceremonies he officiated. He laughed and said no way. He basically tells the couple not to include it because it only invites a moment of anxiety at best, misery at worst.    His best story (and one of the reasons he stopped including the question) was a couple where the lead up to the wedding the couple was obviously in love. The bride to be was very smiley and happy. Day of the wedding she’s stone faced. He knows something is up because he’s never seen her like this and he asks if she is ok. “I’m fine.”    Right before the service he asks again. “I’m fine.”    He gets to the question, “Does anyone object to this union?”    The bride reaches over, grabs the maid of honor, shoves her into the bride’s spot and says, “You’re screwing him, you marry him.” And then stormed out of the church.  To gain more insight on this scandalous topic, we reached out to the experts at Bespoke Bride, and lucky for us, Editor Jack Burns was kind enough to have a chat with Bored Panda. First, we wanted to know if anyone from the Bespoke Bride team had ever been in attendance when a wedding was halted due to an objection. “None of us have been to a scandalous wedding where this happened, but we have heard a few stories where it did,” Jack said. “One story that we remember was about a city wedding in London, where just as the couple exchanged their heartfelt vows, a hushed murmur swept through the crowd. A figure, dressed in a flamboyant suit, burst through the entrance, drawing everyone's attention,” he continued. “It was a long-lost friend of the groom, known for his outrageous and unpredictable behavior. The friend's voice boomed through the room, as he declared something like, ‘Stop this wedding! You can't marry her!’”  #3 Not quite the question as asked, but too funny to not share:    Priest: ""Any objections?""    Father of the bride: _lets out the hardest, loudest, most complex-sounding sneeze I've ever heard in my life, completely with involuntarily saying ""ACHOOOOOO""_    Mother of the bride, hammered on champagne: ""For f**k's sake, Jerry!""    It took a good five minutes for everyone to regain their composure.  #4 My cat was my best man and when our friend who ordained our wedding asked if there were any objections he let out a long a*s meow  “He continued to tell how he loved the bride and how they shared some secret moments in the past,” Jack went on to explain. “The room erupted into a flurry of whispers and murmurs, as guests turned to one another, shocked by the drama. The bride, tears streaming down her face, stood frozen. But then the groom stepped forward and said something like, ‘This is not the time nor the place for such declarations. You had your chance, and you let it slip away.’ The officiant, trying to restore order, intervened and asked the rude friend to leave. Reluctantly, he complied. The ceremony resumed, but the shadow of the objection lingered over the celebration.”  #5 I was not at the wedding, but know of a case where there was an objection, and the circumstances were quite exceptional.    When I was a detective with the Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit, we dealt with a case involving a 14-year-old girl who had been raped by a known adult male. The first disclosure of the rape was made by her AT HIS WEDDING CEREMONY, which she attended uninvited. When the pastor asked if there were objections, she rose and said yes, she had an objection; the groom had raped her a week before. The pastor stopped proceedings and took the child to an adjacent office, where she repeated the allegation and gave more information.    Shockingly, the bride was still willing to go through with the ceremony, which was concluded while the girl waited in the office. Afterwards, the pastor took her to the local police station (Bellville South in Cape Town, South Africa), where a case was opened and the matter assigned to my unit for investigation.    We carried out the arrest at the V & A Waterfront, Cape Town the next evening (Sunday), where the groom and his friends were partying it up. The bride, of course, was left home alone, one day after the wedding.    I was blown away by the courage it took for the girl to attend the wedding ceremony alone, surrounded by the friends and family of the perpetrator, and to make the disclosure to his face in the way she did.    For those wondering how she knew so much about him and when he would be getting married; he lived in close proximity to the girl's family in Bellville South and the two families knew each other. He had siblings who attended school with her.  #6 I went to a Catholic wedding where, when the priest asked this question, one of the groomsmen did a VERY loud, long, throat clearing, which got everyone laughing. Everyone except for the bride's elderly Italian Grandmother who marched out of her seat and angrily hit the groomsman with her handbag and shouted at him in Italian!  Thankfully, most couples don’t need to worry about any objections today, as Jack says this tradition has largely become symbolic over time, rather than a genuine question for the guests. “In fact, many couples choose to omit this part of the ceremony altogether,” the editor noted. “Mainly because the objection portion of the ceremony was once a legal requirement to ensure there were no legal impediments to the marriage. However, in most jurisdictions, the legalities are taken care of before the wedding day, making the objection part unnecessary.” “Secondly, weddings today tend to focus more on celebrating the love and commitment between the couple, rather than entertaining the possibility of awkward objections,” Jack continued. “Lastly, objections raised during weddings are exceptionally rare. In modern days, if someone has a legitimate objection to a marriage, they typically address it privately with the couple before the wedding day. We at Bespoke Bride would recommend omitting it to maintain a more seamless and joyful ceremony.”  #7 One of my cousins is married to literally one of the kindest and coolest dudes I have ever met. Before the wedding, her little sister was saying how “she’s marrying my best friend.” At the wedding, when the priest dude asks if anyone objects, the room is dead quiet and all you hear is a little girlish whisper “I do.” It was honestly really adorable and we all laughed, and my cousin’s husband and her little sister are still best friends.  #8 Not a wedding, but at a funeral someone objected the death.    At my uncle’s funeral, his ex wife and a local church [cult] leader tried to raise him from the dead. We were all sitting there like normal people at a normal funeral and she walks up to the casket and starts yelling, “James Lester, raise up!” I didn’t know she was there or I would’ve prepared myself for shenanigans. Also I didn’t know my uncle’s middle name was Lester, so please imagine the confusion. So she and the cult leader are literally yelling at my uncle’s body. Not surprisingly, my uncle refused to resurrect himself. They were escorted out.    I’ve actually never told this story because it makes my family look insane.  Jack went on to note that most couples do not anticipate any sort of dramatic interruptions during their wedding ceremonies today, because they are proceeding based on “a strong foundation of love, trust, and commitment, with the expectation that their day will be filled with joy and celebration.” But if anyone out there is considering disrupting a friend or family member’s wedding, the wedding expert says that it should be approached with extreme caution and should only be considered in truly exceptional circumstances. “Ensure that you have legitimate and valid concerns, like evidence of fraud or coercion, or any other significant issue that would genuinely affect the couple's well-being.”  #9 This was in America, and the wedding was in a Buddhist temple. Parents of the groom stood up and objected because they didn’t believe the bride was of the same class. They spoke in another language so most of the English speaking guests didn’t know they were objecting.    My husband was the best man and those closest to the couple knew this might happen. The Buddhist priest said he would handle it if the parents tried anything.    After the parents spoke for a while the priest said to the groom, “You’ve heard what your parents had to say, what do you want to do?” The groom replied, “I want to marry my bride.” So the priest asked the parents to leave. At this point the rest of the guests are clueing in that this was not a nice part of the ceremony, and that the parents were actually objecting, so, as the parents walked out, some of the guests were berating them saying things like, “You should be ashamed of yourself” and “How could you do that?” And even though the groom was not happy with his parents, that was very hard for him to hear.    That was 30 years ago. The couple is still married. They have two beautiful, successful children. After the groom’s mom passed away, the groom’s father came around and was involved in their lives until he died.  #10 I objected. I took giving my sister away literally. I wasn't the brightest 3 year old.  “We also recommend addressing your concerns privately with the couple before the wedding day,” Jack told Bored Panda. “If you still believe there are serious grounds for objection on the wedding day itself, it is crucial to approach the matter with sensitivity and discretion. Speak privately with the officiant or a trusted wedding organizer who can guide you on the appropriate course of action. Disrupting the ceremony should be an absolute last resort.” “Think about the consequences, as any disruption or objection during a wedding ceremony can have significant emotional and social consequences,” the editor added. “It can cause distress and embarrassment to the couple, their families, and their guests. Be prepared for potential backlash or strained relationships resulting from your actions.” If you’d like to learn more about wedding planning, wedding etiquette or gain some inspiration for your own big day, be sure to check out Bespoke Bride right here to hear more from the experts!  #11 Well, sort of. It was staged, pre arranged, and the minister was warned ahead of time.      The couple said they wanted to make the ceremony more interesting. So they had a friend object, declaring his love for the bride in an over the top dramatic speech.      The best man (my husband) stabbed the guy with a stage dagger, he played dead, and two of the other groomsmen dragged his limp body away. The wedding proceeded.      I have to say, it was pretty awesome. The bride and groom are still happily married 30+ years later.  #12 A woman, in her 20s at the time, objected to her mom marrying my uncle. So she started yelling, “Mom don’t marry him!” during the ceremony. The ceremony proceeded and some family on the mom’s side lead the daughter away to quit interrupting. I don’t blame her-my uncle was a lying, lazy bastard. The marriage didn’t last.  We were also lucky enough to get in touch with two more wedding experts, Kathy and Danielle, Editors at The Wedding Playbook, to hear their thoughts on the topic. Kathy and Danielle shared that, fortunately, they've never been in attendance at a wedding that was halted in a scandalous way. ""It’s more common for us to hear about people who object to a marriage opting not to attend the wedding, which is a quieter but no less heart-wrenching form of protest,"" they told Bored Panda.  #13 A friend of mine has a band that plays lots of weddings and other parties. They were hired for a birthday party that turned out to be a surprise wedding. The guy surprised his gf with a proposal and wanted to have a wedding ceremony then and there. She said no and left  #14 I used to make wedding videos. Did one at an outdoor wedding spot high on one side of a valley. It had rained earlier in the day but the storms had cleared and the wedding could continue.    During the vows I don't touch the camera, just step back and let it run. So I'm spaced out waiting for the vows to finish and notice a radio tower far across the valley. Suddenly lightning hits the radio tower. I had enough time to think ""Boy when the thunder gets here it'll probably loud.""    I also had enough time to clue in that the minister was saying ""If anyone objects to this union let him speak now or forever..."" KEBLAMMMMMMMM!    Total silence in the venue. Preacher takes a second to look around and make sure everybody is alright, on one has been smote. ""Well that's never happened before.""    AFAIK they're still married, that was 10 years or more ago...  The wedding experts also shared that, ""If it’s not a cultural or religious requirement, [asking for objections] is definitely one part of the wedding ceremony you can do without. It either leads to an awkward pause or a melodramatic made-for-TV moment, both of which detract from what is meant to be a happy occasion."" ""Instead, the officiant can ask if the couple has the blessing of their loved ones for the marriage - but only if they know the answer will be a resounding yes!"" Kathy and Danielle added.  #15 I dunno if it's a UK thing or even just a one specific church thing but I was told by the priest in a rehearsal that if someone objects, even as a joke, the priest is required to pause the ceremony and talk to the objector alone to discuss their concerns and decide if they have a valid objection. Like it's not a fun jokey moment, it's a real legal part of the ceremony.    He also said it used to be custom that if you raised an invalid objection you then had to pay for the wedding.  #16 My husband's first marriage. The brother of the bride stood up and said to my husband ""Say no, you can still be happy!""    They went through with the marriage, wound up divorcing with a messy break up.    Brother in law is still best friends with my husband (as far as he's concerned he gained a brother and lost a sister and is better off for it) and he never lets him forget the fact that he was right and he should have bailed lol.    Edited for clarification  ""Naturally, couples want to be surrounded by love on their wedding day and hope that the people they’ve invited to witness their vows are supportive of the relationship,"" Kathy and Danielle noted. But they added that not everyone needs approval to go through with tying the knot. ""Most would continue with their wedding plans even if there’s a chance of an objection because it’s important to them to publicly declare their commitment to one another. It’s symbolic of their decision to face all of life’s ups and downs together."" There are even ways around objections if your friends and family aren't on board. ""Those who are especially worried that friends or family might disagree with their marriage often plan an elopement to ensure only positive memories of the day,"" Kathy and Danielle told us.  #17 I was at one where the Groom thanked the Bride's Ex for dying as his loss was my gain.    Didn't help the sons of his bride and ex were in attendance  #18 Groom found out that bride was cheating two days before the wedding day. He spilled the beans while exchanging the vows.  And if you want to object to a friend's wedding, Kathy and Danielle say that there's likely a better way to go about it. ""There’s no more hurtful way to say you don’t support your friend or family member’s life choices than with an announcement on their wedding day,"" they told Bored Panda. ""Even if you have a valid reason, we recommend addressing it in private before the event to spare the couple any embarrassment worthy of a soap opera season finale. Unless there’s a legal, moral or wellbeing concern, it might be a case of putting aside your own feelings and being happy that they’re happy in order to preserve your relationship.""

He fell into a group of friends who were a little wilder than me. I don't blame him. College is supposed to be fun. I missed out. That's my fault because I did a five year program that got me my BA and MBA in short order.    After school ended, he was asked by a new friend to be his best man. I knew the guy and his fiance secondhand. He was a bit of an ogre and she was cute, a bit mousy. I wasn't at the wedding, but the big day comes and we all go about our lives.    It was the 90s and I worked that Saturday (yes, ""Office Space"" culture was real then). I go out to our watering hole that night and there was my best friend, drinking a double whiskey in a disheveled tux.    ""Good wedding? How was the reception grub?"", I asked.    ""No wedding. No reception. I ate dinner at Applebee's by myself."", he said.    The bride told the limo driver to take her for a few big laps. She eventually showed, gathered her family around her, and told the groom it was not happening today or ever. The physical and mental abuse was too much and she was too far into a drug habit he pushed on her and was going to seek help.    Now understand, only a few at the wedding knew any of the abuse or drug abuse was going on. The ogre went into a rage, tried to attack her, and got repelled by the better men and women in the crowd.    She got her help and self-confidence back and married a great guy a few years later. Three kids, almost 30 years together. Her would-be husband kept up his bad habits and ended up killing his girlfriend and himself in a drug-fueled murder/suicide in our 30s.    Still shocks me to this day. My best friend has been pretty much straight and narrow since. It sobered him up in many ways.  #20 Kind of.    My uncle was getting married. Small, just a handful of family and a minister. I was videotaping.    My grandmother was not into it at all. With each line spoken by the minister, she had a cutting, sarcastic response. I could not believe it. It was so unlike her,    When that part came up, she said “I object. But does it really matter? They are going to to do it anyway.”    The minister just ignored her and proceeded, business as usual.    They were divorced within a year.    Wish I had a copy.  #21 My mother passed away about 15 years ago. 5 years later my dad married my now step-mother. It was an outdoor wedding on a beautiful sunny day, and during the spot where they usually ask if anyone objects, a big gust of wind came out of nowhere and knocked over some tables. Afterward, multiple people came to tell me that wind gust was my mother objecting, which I like to believe was true.  #22 I went to a wedding where the best man was replaced a week before because he banged the bride. But the wedding still went ahead just with a different best man. They are divorced now.  #23 My grandmother objected at my sister's wedding. My sister was a Florida based Italian Catholic and somewhat conservative individual who fell in love with a progressive New York Jew.    My Nonna said it wouldnt work and it would change one of them and she was worried about it changing her grand daughter. My parents managed to get her away from the wedding and it continued. My sister is now neither Catholic or conservative, so my Nonna was absolutely right.  #24 I was at a small ceremony indoors, maybe 30 people tops listening. When the minister asked for any objections, a picture of the bride’s dead grandmother that was hanging on the wall fell to the ground with a loud thump. We looked at each other but the minister finished anyway. Divorced within a year.  #25 Oldie but a goodie, this happened back in the 70s, this was shared to le by the guy who married my parents. It went something like this :      ""does anyone object to this union?""      "" I do! That's my husband!""      So they paused the wedding, the bride, groom and the woman objecting went into a small room. The woman who objected provided documentation showing the groom was still legally her husband. Apparently the couple had started divorce proceedings some time earlier but never finished. The wedding was cancelled and everyone sent home.  #26 My aunties fiance was already married (lady stood up waving marriage cert) so wedding didn't go ahead. The reception was on a long boat so we still went to that. The fiance went back to home country to sort it out and never came back.  #27 Went to a wedding where they skipped that part because the brides adult daughter was planning to object.  #28 A relative visited one ceremony where it was asked if anyone objects, and the groom decided it's a good time for a joke and said ""I do"". The lady who was going to marry the couple just turned and left. They had to go through all the paperwork again and change the date. Got married, divorced in like three years if I remember correctly.  #29 At his rehearsal dinner a co-workers mother toast included that his soon to be wife was a ""damn dirty w***e who wasn't good enough"" for her son. Folks not happy. (Video ended so didn't see the whole thing.)    At wedding which I attended his mom started to say something at the ""speak now"" part but was silenced by her daughter. Mom left and didn't see the rest of the ceremony.    Everything about that poor guy was drama.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvcmVkcGFuZGEuY29tL29iamVjdGVkLWF0LXdlZGRpbmctc3Rvcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-07-10","15:00:00","{""Rockville"", ""Maryland"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T20:09:17","ROCKVILLE — A Rockville woman finally received a check for $1,204.15 following a WRTV Investigation into how her wedding ring got lost in the mail.    WRTV Investigates first introduced you to Janet Risler back in April.  She paid $19.95 to insure her $1,200 wedding ring’s journey to get repaired in Missouri.  Risler contacted WRTV Investigates after a year long battle with the U.S. Postal Service to get a refund for her lost ring.  “I’m exhausted,” said Risler. “I’m frustrated.”  Our investigation caught the attention of Ryan Many, a Senior Consumer Relations Specialist at the U.S. Postal Service in Washington D.C.  “I located your information from past service requests made with the United States Postal Service,” wrote Many in an email to WRTV. “I recently learned of a news article that I believe has to do with your lost wedding ring with tracking number (redacted), and I would love to assist you in getting a claim created and potentially paid.”  Risler said she was surprised, but also skeptical.  ""I was a little leery because he was very willing to help, and I didn't know if it was a scam,” said Risler to WRTV Investigates Kara Kenney. “So, I texted you and you said go for it, sounds great.""  Weeks later, Risler received something in the mail from the U.S. Postal Service.  ""This is my check for $1200, which is what I had it insured for,” said Risler. “Thanks to you and Ryan Many, I got it. I thank you so much. It shows you justice will prevail.""  WRTV Investigates found Janet Risler is not alone.  We filed a FOIA request with the U.S. Postal Service and found of the 842,973 insurance claims filed in 2022, only 38% or 320,033 were paid by USPS.  We filed another FOIA request and found dozens of reasons why claims are denied including the customer didn’t have the proper documentation such as proof of the item’s value, or proof they purchased insurance.  USPS also denied claims because they determined the item was not actually lost or damaged.  USPS can also deny claims if you do not file within a specific time frame.  For insured mail/packages, you have to file a claim after 15 days but before 60 days.  In Risler’s case, she says the postmaster initially gave her the wrong form, and when she finally filed the right form (Domestic Claim PS Form 1000), it was too late.  “They said it’s been too long, that I waited too long to fill out this claim,” said Risler.  WRTV Investigates stopped by post offices in Indianapolis to see if we could get a Domestic Claim PS Form 1000.    WRTV Investigates Kara Kenney: “Do you guys have the lost mail forms? It’s like a PS 1000 form?  “Do you guys have the lost mail forms? It’s like a PS 1000 form? USPS Employee : “Lost mail form?”  : “Lost mail form?” WRTV Investigates Kara Kenney: “Yeah, it’s a claim form.”  “Yeah, it’s a claim form.” USPS Employee: “It’s all done online now.”  “It’s all done online now.” WRTV Investigates Kara Kenney: “Just online? Ok thank you.”  The U.S. Postal Service encourages you to gather your documents, including receipt for insurance, and then file an electronic claim on their website.  Janet Risler said she never would have gotten her money back had WRTV Investigates not gotten involved.  “Thank you so much,” said Risler. “Justice has been served. That was really my whole issue. I hope they don’t do that to other people.”  Janet Risler only wears bands on her finger now—no diamond.  In fact, she has no plans to buy another wedding ring.  ""I think we need to eat a steak dinner,” said Risler to her husband Larry. “We are going to celebrate.""

The Australian musician, 29, wed the Selling Sunset star, 41, in a secret Las Vegas ceremony earlier this month, and the couple is still enjoying every moment of marital bliss.  “It was probably the best day of my life, and we had so much fun, and it was just super beautiful and super cute,” the singer tells PEOPLE exclusively of their big day.  “It’ll forever be one of the greatest memories of my life. And we're actually planning to get married every single year. I don't know why more people don't do that. Like, it's your person that you spend like every day with. Wouldn't you wanna have a party to celebrate your life every single year? So yeah, we're gonna do it. We're so into it”  Stause first confirmed her romance with G Flip during the Selling Sunset reunion episode, five months after she split from Jason Oppenheim.  ""I recently have been spending a lot of time with someone that's very important to me. Their name is G Flip. They're non-binary, so they go by they/them,"" said Stause during the episode. ""And they are an extremely talented musician.""  Megan Rasmussen  PEOPLE confirmed the couple’s wedding after Stause posted an Instagram Reel on May 10, which featured a quick picture of the pair married at the altar.  The clip included a series of sweet photos and videos of the couple throughout their relationship, ending with a shot of the two sharing a kiss at their surprise wedding. G Flip's new single dedicated to Stause, ""Be Your Man"" played in the background of the video.  ""Love doesn't always go as planned… Sometimes it's immeasurably better,"" Stause captioned the cute post, plugging her partner's new song that dropped the same day.

But for me and Chrishell, that day she posted the montage and one of the photos was us in Vegas, we were off our phones, just hanging out laughing, and making funny TikToks, just like living as we do,” they said. “We weren't really fazed, but we were surprised. We were like, holy s***. A lot of people care about this.”  As the newlyweds continue to celebrate their recent nuptials, G Flip adds that not much has changed at home.  “We're just living life. We're just two people who spend every day with each other, and we make each other so happy,” they said. “So while this chaos is going around, we're just like doing normal relationship, couple things. Hanging on the couch, going to get dinner, seeing our friends. It feels pretty normal to me... it's great finding someone that you just wanna spend every second with and this... Makes you happier.

"wedding","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Munich"", ""Bavaria"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-23T15:57:42","When Sophie Evekink married Prince Ludwig of Bavaria on May 20, 2023, something quite unexpected happened to the royal bride. While Evekink was reciting her vows at Theatiner Church in Munich, Germany, she fainted. Royal blogger ChristinZ recapped the incident on Twitter on the day of their nuptials. “A spokesperson confirmed that Princess Sophie fainted during the wedding this morning,” she tweeted. “After a drink, she was fine again and the ceremony continued.” The blogger also created a thread and quoted German newspaper Bild. “The bride fell backwards, the groom caught her,” the tweet said. “The maid of honours rushed over, paramedics brought her water. She felt well again straight away. Prince Leopold of Bavaria gave her a piece of glucose.” According to the outlet, after the bride left the church, she had enough energy to wave to the crowds.  Besides the minor health scare, the royal affair was full of stylish looks. The bride wore a lace-embroidered A-line gown with long sleeves designed by Reem Acra, per People. Evekink accessorized with a diamond cross necklace and matching earrings and a diamond tiara attached to her lace cathedral-length veil. She also carried a bouquet of lily of the valley. The groom sported a gray vest and black jacket with a paisley-printed tie. According to the publication, the flower girls and page boys wore clothes inspired by the traditional styles and colors of Bavaria. The young bridal party members donned white dresses with puff sleeves, a ruffled bib collar, a blue sash, and flower crowns. The boys were clad in blue pants with white collared shirts.  After the bride and groom held their royal ceremony, they celebrated at a reception, which took place Nymphenburg Palace. Prince Ludwig’s cousin Duke Franz of Bavaria hosted the event, People reported. Ahead of their big day, a spokesperson told the outlet that the ceremony and reception would include personal touches and honor the region, such as Bavarian delegations during the vow exchange and local food and drinks on the post-ceremony menu.  Although it’s unclear when the prince and princess of Bavaria first met, they announced their engagement in August 2022. At the time, Prince Ludwig’s father, Prince Luitpold, told Bild that he was excited to welcome Evekink into the royal family. “Ludwig made a good choice,” he shared. “My future daughter-in-law is a very intelligent and educated woman. I hope they start a family soon. It is very gratifying that Ludwig is now more in Bavaria again.""  Prince Ludwig is on the path to becoming the head of Bavaria. Since the ruling Duke Franz doesn’t have any children he will be succeeded by his brother, Prince Max of Bavaria. Max doesn’t have any sons, so he will pass his title on to his cousin Prince Luitpold and his descendants, which includes Ludwig. The prince is also an expert in human rights and international humanitarian law, a board member of the Nymphenburg Aid Association, and the founder of several nonprofit organizations in Kenya. Meanwhile, his wife is studying to receive her doctorate at the Law Faculty at Oxford University, where she also teaches a course on transitional justice at the university’s Criminology Centre. In the past, Evekink worked for the United Nations on health and human rights.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vc29waGllLWV2ZWtpbmstZmFpbnRlZC1yb3lhbC13ZWRkaW5nLXByaW5jZS1sdWR3aWctYmF2YXJpYS03NTAxNzAy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As a close friend or family member of the bride or groom, that entails attending the main ceremony plus rehearsal dinner the night before. Rehearsal dinners allow extra time for intimate speeches and catching up with the couple’s inner circle, in addition to practicing for the big day. But what to wear? If your focus has been mainly on a wedding guest dress for the ceremony, your best wedding rehearsal-dinner guest dress is one that’s fuss-free. In fact, it’s a great occasion to even pull from the collection of last summer’s wedding guest dresses still sitting in your closet.  As bridal consultant Anny Choi explains, rehearsal dinners tend to be more relaxed than the wedding itself. That makes it the perfect occasion for an easy sundress, comfortable shoes, and potentially even a few fun accessories like a sun hat, oversize sunglasses, or trendy jewelry. The invitation may have extra outfit guidance: “A lot of weddings these days will have a theme for the welcome party and rehearsal, so make sure to double-check the invite before putting together your outfit,” Choi advises. “Pay attention to the venue and the location! Is it a clambake on a beach? Or is it a more formal sit-down dinner at a hotel restaurant? Obviously, stick to the color or theme if suggested.” And if you’re planning to re-wear a dress you already own, the way you choose to style it can make all the difference for the second go-round.  Ahead, shop 25 rehearsal dinner dresses for wedding guests that will allow you to toast the special couple in style.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vdHJlbmRzL2c0MzkzMzAyNy9iZXN0LXdlZGRpbmctcmVoZWFyc2FsLWRpbm5lci1ndWVzdC1kcmVzc2VzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","{""SantaBarbara"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:25:18","Before Julia Louis-Dreyfus said “I do” to Brad Hall in 1987, she turned to a very influential source to inspire her wedding dress design: The Veep star channeled her inner Princess Diana when she walked down the aisle to her husband nearly 36 years ago. During an appearance on Live With Kelly and Mark on May 22, 2023, the Seinfeld actress opened up about her long-term relationship and the gown she chose for her nuptials. “You and your husband have been married for 35 years,” host Kelly Ripa remarked on the episode. Ripa proceeded to show a photo from the actress and the Saturday Night Live alum’s big day. “Yes, look at that wedding dress,” Louis-Dreyfus laughed. “You’ll see I fashioned my dress after Princess Diana.” Ripa replied, “It’s a beautiful wedding photo.”  For her special day, the bride sported a voluminous ball gown featuring puff sleeves and ruffles along the neckline and on the cuffs of her sleeves. She also tied her hair back in a low chignon and completed her hairstyle with a flower crown and a cathedral-length veil. To pull her look together, the bride carried a bouquet of white flowers and greenery. According to Us Weekly, the groom dressed himself in an English morning suit with a broad cravat necktie for the occasion.  Over the years, Louis-Dreyfus has posted several throwback photos from her nuptials. Most recently, on June 25, 2022, the actress celebrated her 35th wedding anniversary by uploading a snap of the couple linking arms and smiling on their wedding day. “Even though we’re surrounded by a lot of bad news, I’m celebrating some good news today - Been tied to this superb guy for 35 years!” she said in her caption. “What in the living hell? How did that happen so quick?” She also marked her wedding anniversary on June 25, 2016, with a black-and-white portrait of the duo on the day they tied the knot. “29 years ago today,” she wrote. “A good choice. #remain.” The hashtag refers to the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.  Louis-Dreyfus first met Hall while auditioning for his theater production in the early 1980s, according to HuffPost. “There were a couple of moments, some of which I will not share,” she said of meeting Hall. “But I would say that I knew almost immediately [he was the one]. It’s really the truth.” On June 25, 1987, the duo traded vows in a church in Santa Barbara, California, which is where Hall grew up. According to The New Yorker, the groom’s father was the minister.  Cindy Ord / Getty Images  Since then, the duo has worked together on several projects, such as Saturday Night Live, Watching Ellie, and Picture Paris. “He always appreciates the hard work, but sometimes, he’ll say we are honest with one another, so that if he doesn’t think it quite works or something, he’ll tell me why,” Louis-Dreyfus explained on collaborating with one another. “And I’ll do the same with his work.” The couple has spent their marriage raising two children, Henry and Charlie, and supporting one another, especially when Louis-Dreyfus was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, People reports. “It was like [my family] had their hands underneath me holding me up,” she recalled. Going through that health care as a family increased their connection. “I think whenever a family goes through a crisis and comes out the other end, you're bound to have an intimacy that, perhaps, wasn't quite there like it was before,” she shared.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vcHJpbmNlc3MtZGlhbmEtaW5zcGlyZWQtanVsaWEtbG91aXMtZHJleWZ1cy13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzLTc1MDE2NjDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In a viral video that has amassed 5.1 million views as of this writing, TikToker and hairstylist Adrianna Thomas (@thomasadrianna) showed off one of her client’s creative baking and decorating skills.  “I have the most unique and talented brides!!!,” the TikToker, who does bridal hairstyles, captioned the video. “Lilly stacked her own wedding cake the day of, full face, hair done and white robe! not 1 crumb on her robe!”  TikTok users took to the comments section to share their thoughts. Many criticized the cake and put the bride on blast for working on her special day, instead of hiring someone else to do it.  “Wait…..that’s finished?” said one user about the cake. “Get somebody else to do it.”  “It looks so untidy,” another added.  “Sis I am very frugal but some things you should pay people to do and the sis one of those things,” chimed in a third.  Adrianna stepped in to defend her client. “It’s not your wedding, it was hers,” the stylist wrote. “Do what you want on your wedding day.”  Other users also threw in their support for the bride’s cake and congratulated her effort.  “The video doesn’t capture the texture of the cake,” one user commented. “That’s why it looks “unfinished” to some.”  “Y’all trashing her cake when it’s her own cake and she loved it,” another wrote. “I’d love to see any of y’all do that for your own wedding…”  One person even thought the bride’s cake reminded them of a famous piece of art.  “Everyone hating in it…but to me I see an abstract Monet Starry Night,” the user said, later clarifying that they meant Van Gogh’s Starry Night.  Many brides have gone viral for posting their wedding day hacks online. With the average cost of weddings steadily increasing across the country, it makes sense for people to try new ways to cut down costs.  One bride made waves after she shared a video about using Chili’s to cater her wedding. And many vowed to never hire a DJ after a TikToker revealed that he gets paid $4,000 but simply plays a Spotify wedding song playlist at weddings.

A wedding, while one of the most important days of someone’s life, has become quite the expensive affair, especially in recent years. The average wedding cost — including the ceremony and reception — in 2022 was $30,000, according to The Knot.  Thankfully, there are plenty of loan options available if you find yourself in need of filling any funding gaps. Depending on your financial situation, a typical fixed-rate personal loan may be a good option for financing your big day.  Types of loans you can use for a wedding  There are a number of loan options available for financing a wedding; however, it’s not a one-size-fits-all process so it’s important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each option before making a final decision.  Wedding loan  Lightbulb Who it’s best for Those with good credit who need to borrow a specific amount.  A wedding loan is a personal loan that’s marketed toward those who need to cover wedding-related expenses. You’ll most likely find these loans with an online lender — traditional banks and credit unions typically don’t offer loans labeled as such.  Some online lenders offer wedding loans as a separate product, but not every institution will. Keep in mind that just because a lender offers a wedding loan doesn’t mean that it’s automatically a good fit.  Compare the lender’s wedding loans to its personal loan details. Check to see if the rates, repayment terms, usage restrictions and fees are the same between the two products to see if there’s any value in taking out a wedding loan over a regular personal loan.  Benefits Potentially lower interest rates than a credit card.  Fast access to cash, sometimes as soon as one to two business days.  Most lenders offer prequalification without impacting your credit. Drawbacks Interest rates may be higher than loans for other uses.  May encourage or tempt you to spend past your budget limit.  Potential for fees, like origination or late-payment charges.  Unsecured personal loan  Lightbulb Who it’s best for Borrowers who need a large lump-sum amount quickly.  Unsecured personal loans are essentially a wedding loan without the label. Most lenders have borrowing caps between $30,000 and $50,000, with some offering a maximum amount of $100,000 to the most creditworthy borrowers.  Unsecured personal loans, like wedding loans, don’t require any collateral which can make it harder to get approved. Those with good or excellent credit, a steady, reliable income and a solid financial record are most likely to meet the approval requirements.  The sheer convenience of having a large lump-sum amount of cash on hand to spend however necessary is one of the contributing factors that make taking out a personal loan for a wedding so enticing. Plus, most lenders don’t restrict what you can use the loan for — as long as it’s a legal purchase.  Benefits: Large borrowing amounts depending on creditworthiness.  Pay off in fixed, monthly installments with interest rates that don’t change.  Can be used for more than just your wedding if needed. Drawbacks: Repayment will usually take at least two years.  Potentially high interest rates and expensive fees.  Involves taking on debt, which can lead to a debt cycle if you’re not careful.  Home equity loan  Lightbulb Who it’s best for Homeowners with a significant amount of equity built up in their home.  A home equity loan is a lump sum amount of money that you borrow from the equity you’ve previously established in your home. Equity is the total value of the home minus the amount you owe on your mortgage. Most lenders allow you to borrow a maximum of 80 to 85 percent of the equity you have.  Home equity loans can be useful for funding a wedding for a variety of reasons. For one, the money is disbursed in a lump sum amount, so you can get the cash you need all at once.  Home equity loans may also allow you to borrow more than you would be able to with a personal loan if you have adequate equity built up in your home. While this can be an asset to your wedding planning process, it’s important to make sure you don’t over borrow, as you run the risk of losing your home.  Benefits Collateral may result in lower borrowing costs than with personal loans.  Fixed interest rates with set monthly payments.  Longer repayment terms than with other types of loans. Drawbacks Run the risk of losing your home if you fail to make the payments.  Must have sufficient credit and equity to qualify.  May have to pay closing costs, which typically range from 2 to 5 percent of the loan amount.  Home equity line of credit  Lightbulb Who it’s best for Those in the beginning stages of their wedding planning process who have equity in their home  A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is like a home equity loan in that you borrow from your home’s equity. The main distinction between the two is that one allows you to draw funds over time, while the other is disbursed in a lump sum.  HELOC’s often have much longer repayment terms, sometimes that span up to 20 years, so the monthly payment can be much lower than with a loan. Plus, rates, while variable, are often lower with a HELOC than with a loan.  Typically you can borrow up to 80 percent of your home’s equity with a HELOC, and its flexibility makes it a popular choice for financing a wedding. Unlike other borrowing methods, you’re able to borrow more as needed up to your credit limit, which can make it a useful resource in the case of unexpected or emergency expenses.  Benefits: Flexible withdrawals through the draw period.  Potentially lower APRs than credit cards and other loans.  Longer repayment terms than with other types of loans. Drawbacks: Home is collateral.  You’re reducing your home’s existing equity.  Variable interest rates that are subject to change based on the economy.  What is the best loan to get for a wedding?  If you have excellent credit and solid finances, an unsecured, fixed-rate personal loan is likely your best choice when it comes to financing your wedding. This is because your strong credit makes you more likely to be offered the most competitive rates, favorable terms and low fees that can make repayment a smoother process.  Fixed interest rates stay the same over the life of the entire loan unless you refinance with a different lender for a different interest rate, which is an important asset to be aware of right now. As the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates with the aim of slowing inflation, scoring a loan with a fixed rate could save you thousands in interest.  What’s more, some lenders offer benefits and perks that can increase the overall value of your loan. For example, it’s common for lenders to offer a 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent interest rate reduction for enrolling in autopay, while others may offer grace periods and alternative repayment options.  While an unsecured fixed-rate personal loan won’t be best for every borrower out there, it’s at least worth considering if you need to borrow a loan to pay for your upcoming nuptials.  How to apply for a wedding loan  Keep these steps in mind when applying for a loan to finance your wedding-related expenses.  1. Check your credit score and report  Your credit report is essentially a more detailed look at your credit history. Your report contains your score, your repayment history (including any missed payments), accounts you’ve defaulted on and how much hard checks you’ve recently undergone.  Checking your report will give you a well-informed take as to whether it’s a good time financially to take on additional debt. You can check it for free at AnnualCreditReport.com.  2. Shop around and get prequalified  Compare lenders by looking at their minimum eligibility requirements, APR ranges, repayment options, borrowing amounts and fees charged. If possible, prequalify with at least three lenders. This will give you a well-rounded prediction of your approval odds and potential rates with no impact to your credit score.  3. Apply  Once you’ve found the lender that offers the most competitive rates and best meets your needs, you’ll begin the application process. Most of the time it’s completed online, but some lenders may require you to complete a portion of your application in-person.  Most lenders offer quick approval and funding, so make sure the lender you apply with has a funding timeline that best meets your needs.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbmtyYXRlLmNvbS9sb2Fucy9wZXJzb25hbC1sb2Fucy93aGF0LWxvYW4tdG8tcGF5LWZvci1hLXdlZGRpbmcv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A groom who revealed his newly wedded wife had been cheating on him with his best man got the ultimate revenge — revealing her disloyal ways to their guests during his wedding speech.  The shocking wedding drama was shared on the Unfiltered Bride podcast, hosted by Gloucestershire wedding planners Georgina and Beth, who were in disbelief over the tale, which they heard through a third party.  According to the podcast hosts, the furious groom announced his wife’s infidelity to all the guests by handing out photos of the bride having sex with the best man.  “Groom stands up and says ‘Just before I like properly get started, there’s envelopes coming round now, if you could all open them up. Yeah, those are pictures of the bride f–ked the best man, so I’ll be leaving now,'” Georgie explained, telling the story in the clip.  The groom reportedly shared his new wife’s infidelity at the wedding reception.

Karma is a bitch,” the host said. “Karma is a bitch, the best man as well!”  The clip quickly racked up hundreds of comments, with users sharing their thoughts on the situation.  “I don’t blame him at all!!

Others refused to believe the story was real.  “This is such an old urban myth,” one TikToker said doubtfully.  “I’ve seen this recirculating on Twitter for like ten years now,” another wrote.  Some users asked why he would go through with the ceremony if he had no intention of seeing the marriage through — but some TikTokers assured them if they hadn’t filed the paperwork, it wouldn’t be official yet.  “It would be annulled instantly, as long as he has his hands on the paperwork,” one person commented.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzIzL2dyb29tLWJsYXN0cy1icmlkZS1mb3ItY2hlYXRpbmctd2l0aC1iZXN0LW1hbi1pbi1zY2F0aGluZy13ZWRkaW5nLXNwZWVjaC_SAWtodHRwczovL255cG9zdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS8yMy9ncm9vbS1ibGFzdHMtYnJpZGUtZm9yLWNoZWF0aW5nLXdpdGgtYmVzdC1tYW4taW4tc2NhdGhpbmctd2VkZGluZy1zcGVlY2gvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2019-03-16","18:00:00","{""Columbus"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-23T15:45:30","(WJW) — With the average cost of weddings continuing to break bank accounts across the country, it makes sense people would take note of a bride who found a sneaky way to cut costs on catered food.  Vlogger and TikTok creator Madison Mulkey recently revealed she spent just $1,950 on food for her 99 wedding guests — and she did it by getting Chili’s to cater the dinner.  “We loved the price point, I mean you really can’t beat that price point — you just can’t,” she told her TikTok followers in a viral video posted earlier this month. “It’s insane that we only spent that much money for our wedding food.”  The menu, Mulkey said, included chips, salsa, salads, egg rolls, chicken tenders, sliders, Cajun chicken pasta, and even five specialty meals for guests with dietary restrictions.  Mulkey and her family also offset the cost by picking up the food themselves instead of paying for delivery. And since her nuptials took place over a busy St. Patrick’s Day weekend, Chili’s could only handle the order at 11 a.m. — even through Mulkey’s guests wouldn’t be eating it until 6 p.m.  “So we had some time in there,” Mulkey explained. “We had to keep things cold and then we had to have our hired servers — who were really supposed to be cleaning, serving, preparing — really do a lot of the cooking … but everyone made it work, thank goodness.”  Their efforts paid off in the end, Mulkey claimed.  “The food was amazing and other people said so, too,” she said. “But they could have been lying to us.”  Mulkey’s video, which has been viewed over 1 million times on TikTok, has garnered praise from users who loved the idea and commended her creativity. One viewer even claimed she catered her own reception with Chipotle, while another said she was inspired to “get Olive Garden” to provide the dinner for her own wedding.  “Normalize this! Weddings are so out of control. Such a great idea!” another viewer wrote.  Others, meanwhile, were concerned for the servers who were given the additional task of reheating Chili’s takeout for 99 guests.  “All I can think [about] is how stressful this must have been for the staff,” one commenter wrote, while another said she hoped Mulkey “generously tipped [the] servers for the extra unplanned work.”  Even with a generous tip, it’s likely Mulkey’s fast-casual feast was much more affordable than the average cost of catering of a wedding. In a 2022 study, The Knot found that couples were paying an average of $75 per person for catered wedding dinners.  When reached for comment, a representative for Chili’s described Mulkey’s workaround as “iconic.”  “When we saw Madison’s video on TikTok our first thought was ‘iconic’ and there is truly no better way to describe it,” a spokesperson for Chili’s wrote in an emailed statement provided to Nexstar. “Chili’s is grateful to have been part of many wedding celebrations, in big ways and small — whether it’s a party platter of our Crispy Chicken Crispers to even hosting both weddings and receptions in our restaurants (true story), it is an honor to be a part of Madison’s special day.

The average wedding guest is expecting to spend £1,045 on average per wedding this year, equating to £16.6 billion2 across the UK. In 2022, wedding goers spent an average of £883 to mark the first year of restriction-free ceremonies, totalling £15.6 billion3 as a population.  The gift of approval  Gifts for the newlywed couple will be the biggest expense for wedding guests in 2023, with attendees expecting to spend an average of £217.90 on brides and grooms. The most common amount spent on a wedding gift is £25-£50 with 20% of UK weddings guests planning to spend that much per wedding in 2023. 10% indicated they are planning to spend £400 or more.  Accommodation is the second biggest cost for guests at £203.90. Accommodation also saw the biggest increase in spend in 2023, up almost a third (32%) compared to 2022.      Top 5 costs for UK wedding guests in 2023 Increase in cost from 2022 Gift for the couple (including cash) - £217.90 24.6% (2022 - £164.40) Accommodation - £203.90 32.2% (2022 - £154.20) Childcare - £202.70 N/A Travel - £196.20 22% (2022 - £160.80) Outfits and accessories - £160.30 1% (2022 - £158.60)  Beyond cash gifts (47%), wedding-goers are most likely to gift newlyweds with couples’ experiences (21%), kitchen appliances (20%) or home décor and glassware (both 18%). Over two-thirds (68%) of wedding guests are looking to get cashback or earn loyalty points from their wedding guest spend.  In addition to increasing guest spend this year, the average number of guests per wedding is expected to rise in 2023. The research found that the average guest count for weddings in 2023 is 74, compared to 66 in 2022.  Weddings will continue to see a positive rebound effect from Covid-19 in 2023, with over one-third (37%) of UK guests planning to attend more weddings in 2023 compared to 2022. Overall, 52% of UK guests will attend a wedding in 2023 that was postponed since the start of the pandemic in 2020.  Somewhere beyond the sea  Plenty of UK couples are taking the opportunity to get married abroad in 2023, with Spain and Ireland ranking top for destinations to tie the knot outside of the UK. Over one in ten (12%) wedding guests will be heading to Spain for weddings this year, with the same proportion heading to Ireland (12%) for ceremonies in 2023.  Wedding guests will also be looking to earn something back for themselves when celebrating marriages this year, with 68% looking to earn loyalty points or cashback when they spend at weddings. American Express offers a range of Cards that earn Membership Rewards points or cashback. For example, the Platinum Cashback Credit Card offers a range of benefits for new and existing Cardmembers. During the first three months of Cardmembership, new Cardmembers get 5% cashback on eligible purchases, up to £125, and up to 1.25% cashback after that.

A story that’s too thin will dissolve when mixed with the songs. A story that’s too heavy won’t let the songs lift off. To get the right fizzy blend, the balance must be perfect.  That is not yet the case with Mira Nair’s “Monsoon Wedding,” which opened Monday in an always busy, sometimes touching, but strangely mild production at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn. Its shambolic plot lines (drawn from Nair’s 2001 film of the same name) and Indian-pop-meets-marching-band songs, though full of interest individually, fail to build on themselves or one another, leaving the intertwined tale of love and obligation to unravel as fast as it spins.  Not that the movie was a landmark of pith. The arranged marriage of the rich “South Delhi girl” Aditi Verma (played here by Salena Qureshi) and the U.S.-raised Hemant Rai (Deven Kolluri) was but one strand of a multifamily, multigenerational tale arranged in a riotous collage of small, colorful scenes. It didn’t matter how many went nowhere; the editing was all.  The musical tries to maintain that quick-cut effect while also squeezing the material into a traditional musical theater format. Nair told The New York Times she’d been inspired by the example of “Fiddler on the Roof,” a classic that, like “Monsoon Wedding,” encompasses one family’s marital chaos as part of a community’s encounter with tradition and change.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjMvdGhlYXRlci9tb25zb29uLXdlZGRpbmctcmV2aWV3Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

You Won’t Believe Which Unexpected Person Left Teresa in Tears on Her Wedding Day  Season 13 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey highlighted the weeks leading up to Teresa Giudice’s wedding to Luis “Louie” Ruelas, and viewers finally saw the two exchange vows on Teresa Gets Married, which aired on May 23.  How to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Bravo Tuesdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo App.  Though Teresa was feeling nothing but “love, love, love” on the morning of her August 6 nuptials, there was one moment that left the mom of four in tears — and it involved the infamous RHONJ coffee grounds reader, Angie.  As Teresa explained in an interview on the wedding special, Angie, who popped up on Season 13 to tell the ladies about their futures, became a “dear friend” of hers when her dad, Giacinto Gorga (aka Nonno), was in the hospital.  Teresa then read a text she received from Angie on the morning of her wedding, which brought her to tears.  “Good morning, Tre,” the bride read from her phone while sitting in the makeup chair in her bridal suite. “Today’s the big day. I had a dream of your parents last night. Just know they are both walking you down the aisle today. Your dad said, ‘No tears today.’”  Teresa began to cry, as she recalled that her father “would always say that” to her.  “He’s gonna hold your hand the whole time,” the RHONJ OG continued reading. “They both love you so much and can’t wait to dance with you tonight. Love you.”  Related  As the Turning the Tables author revealed in an interview on the episode, her wedding day ended up being a little bittersweet, as neither of her parents could physically be there to guide her down the aisle.  Related  “I would have loved just to have my parents walking down the aisle with me,” she shared. “Waking up today, I said to my parents, I’m like, ‘Ma, Papa, I know you’re here. Be with me all day. Let’s have an amazing day together.’”  Teresa’s late parents were able to be with her in spirit on her big day, though, thanks to her bridesmaid, Jennifer Aydin. After Teresa finished reading the text, Jennifer came in to give the bride a special gift: her “favorite picture” of her mom and dad in a pendant she could wear during the wedding.  Related  Once Teresa was done getting ready, she walked down the aisle (with her $10,000 hairdo!) to marry Louie.  Now that Teresa and Louie have officially tied the knot, Season 13 will continue with a reunion.

The groom was joined by his stunning bride who wore a stylish white silk and lace coord for her second outfit of the day as they danced the night away.  Jamie filmed the live band on stage that performed at the reception as their family and famous pals let their hair down.  Sophie looked like she was having a great time as she danced and sang to the band with one of the singers leaning down at one point to give her the microphone.

They were joined by Spencer, who was reunited with Jamie in Spain this week after Jamie failed to invite him to his UK wedding to Sophie in London last month.  Zara, 26, was seen posing outside the venue in a glamorous floor-length blue dress with a thigh-high split.  The garment featured a plunging neckline and ruffles across the front and along the hem, with the star opting for a pair of open-toed silver heels.  Meanwhile, Millie, 33, wore a yellow dress with cutaway shoulders and a shimmering metallic pattern across it.  She wore a pair of glittered silver platform heels to add a few inches to her stature and shielded her eyes behind a pair of dark sunglasses.  She was joined by Spencer who acted as MC at the wedding, and who wore a black suit and a matching bow tie just like Jamie.  He wore a white shirt and a pair of dark sunglasses and was seen waving to onlookers as he arrived.

Alongside choosing the menu, flowers and decorations and sorting the table plan, body image – how we think and feel about the way we look – can cause worries, too.  We could not identify any previous research that had formally looked at how brides in the UK felt about their body image. To address this, and fill the gap in our knowledge, our research explored how brides felt about their body image in the run-up to their wedding. We focused in particular on any appearance concerns that they had and how these made them feel – from the planning stage right up to the big day itself.

See our Privacy Policy  One hundred and thirty-four women took part in either an interview or an online survey. They were a mix of women planning their weddings and those who had been married in the past three years. Many women experienced feelings of pressure and expectation to look a certain way on their wedding day.  They felt that this pressure came from various sources, including family and friends. They told us that others’ perceptions of how they looked affected their own feelings, both on the wedding day and afterwards. One said:  If you know other people think you look nice then you have more confidence.  Another told us:  I didn’t want to feel ashamed of my appearance. I knew there would be a lot of attention and comments on it. Didn’t want to feel like I’d let people down…there were lots of questions about my appearance and dresses mainly from other women. It felt like how I looked was part of the ‘decoration’ in the same way the table settings and order of service was.  Many of the women we spoke to felt the need to adhere to these pressures through fear of judgment and the expectation that all brides should look beautiful.  Looking back  The knowledge that wedding photographs and videos would provide permanent visual evidence of how they looked added to body image pressures. One said:  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  I wanted to look back at the photographs and feel 100% comfortable with what I saw.  The pressure felt by the women we spoke to also stemmed from the bridal industry, which perpetuates norms and assumptions about how brides should look. One woman, for example, talked about a bad experience she had in a bridalwear shop:  I felt the ladies in the dress shop were quite judgemental, saying I needed to eat better and basically lose weight, so I felt very negative towards me.  Nearly 70% of the women we spoke to who were planning their weddings intended to lose weight in preparation for their wedding day. The pressure to lose weight had a significant effect on their feelings and emotions. One said:  I’m really worried that preparing my weight for my wedding will re-trigger my anorexia and I don’t think people talk about the unnecessary pressure for brides and grooms to lose weight.  Some of the women reported going to extreme measures to achieve their weight-loss goals, including surgery. One had a gastric band fitted in the run-up to the wedding: this is a band around the stomach that limits its expansion, leading to feeling full sooner. Another had a tummy tuck – cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the stomach area.  Women we spoke to talked about the impact of having a permanent record of how they looked on their wedding day. vectorfusionart/Shutterstock  Among the women we spoke to who were already married, only 27% had reached the weight they wanted to for their wedding. One said:  I was distressed when I realised I wouldn’t achieve this weight. I then felt fine approaching the day itself. However, I felt embarrassed after seeing photos of me and regretted getting married at my weight.  Our findings back up what other researchers have found in countries outside of the UK, such as in Australia and the US. This research has drawn attention to the powerful pressures related to wedding appearance and the expectation of how women should look when getting married.  ADVERTISEMENT CONTINUE READING BELOW  If you are getting married, then it is completely natural for you to want to look your best, but prioritise your own wellbeing, too.  If one of your friends or family members is getting married, or if you work in the wedding industry, be conscious of what you are saying to the brides in your life. Make sure you are not inadvertently adding any pressures or expectations to them by commenting on their appearance during what can already be a stressful time. Focus on the joy and connection that is the real heart of a wedding.

"wedding","2018-05-19","Not Discerned","{""Tbilisi"", ""Tbilisi"", ""Georgia""}","2023-05-21T19:32:05","A wedding that wasn’t – Tbilisi’s flag sellers with killer business instincts  Hello again from Georgia, the country that knows neither rest nor weekends. A string of unfortunate events hits again, and cold rains aren’t going anywhere, leaving us all with a feeling of tense and uneasy anticipation that one gets before sneezing. Yet you never know what sneezing brings – a sense of relief or the outset of a long debilitating illness?  Here is Nini with this week’s Dispatch, and, well, here we go again.  Red Wedding  There is no better place to celebrate your wedding than Georgia – a sunny, hospitable country with great cuisine, the best wine, and cheerful, feast-loving people. But those who plan their celebrations must also be aware of local traditions. And one of these sacred wedding traditions is that the party must always end in a good [feast-]fight (because wine is often too good). You can trust me – I, too, was there once, at one of such big wedding parties, watching my loved ones beaten up and dragged down the stairs by a drunken crowd for no apparent reason. But that was many years ago. People have since grown up, revisited their traditions, and while wedding fights are still fought, now they are fought for apparent reasons. And the apparent reason this weekend was the continued struggle of a small country not to be turned into one big restaurant.  Emotions were already running high in Tbilisi when reports started coming that Ekaterina Vinokurova (née Lavrova), the daughter of Sergey Lavrov, top Russian diplomat and one of the orchestrators of the Kremlin-unleashed horror in Ukraine, was attending a wedding in Georgia. It was a tense May 19 evening – a rally at the airport to give a frosty welcome to the first arriving Russian plane in four years had just ended, and the discontent against the recent re-establishment of direct flights with Russia had moved downtown to Rustaveli Avenue. The disruptive rain showers did nothing to improve the overall mood: the day also fell on the tragic anniversary of the murder of Giga Otkhozoria, a Georgian shot dead seven years ago at the crossing point by an Abkhaz serviceman who is yet to be brought to justice. The ominous symbolism that Georgians so love to hate was already there. A wedding ceremony to signify a forced marriage with the imperial neighbor was the last straw.  Yet, it did not escalate all at once. Social media reports took time to verify. By the next morning, it was more or less clear that the brother of Lavrov’s son-in-law was indeed celebrating his wedding at a prominent resort in the Kakheti region. Images of fun reportedly coming from the party started making rounds on social media, evoking the familiar sense of a much-hated imperial image of Georgia as one huge Khinkali p(a)lace. Soon, crowds headed to Kakheti to protest on-site, only to be – predictably – stopped by the police eagerly defending the scene. Detentions followed. And just when the fury was about to peak, President Salome Zurabishvili took it upon herself to save the day, breaking the good news that the crisis had been averted: the partiers had left the country, and the wedding would not be taking place anymore.  Slowly, official confirmations started coming that Lavrov’s daughter was indeed among the guests before the backlash finally forced her (reportedly) out of the country. The ruling party’s excuses ranged from the fact that Lavrova had adopted her husband’s surname and was now Vinokurova, making her harder detectible for authorities – to usual references to Georgia’s literary traditions about the sanctity of hospitality and immunity of guests regardless of their backgrounds (those rebellious literary traditions might be less relevant for current context though).  Georgian Dream leaders also recalled that Mika Vinokurov, the groom and Lavrova’s brother-in-law, had Ukraine-friendly and anti-war posts on his Facebook, in futile and insincere attempts to defend the ceremony. Well, this is where they truly mishandled the situation – had they checked Vinokurov’s social media earlier, who knows, he might have been denied entry like some other Kremlin critics before him, sparing the government all this headache. They will definitely check better next time!

In a city of many unpredictabilities, you never know when it is going to rain or when hell will break loose about yet another absurd development,… and there you go again, trampling the good-old protest site without any idea how things are going to unfold this time. But if you still prefer to leave your house unprepared and thus have to endure adverse weather conditions on Rustaveli Avenue, Tbilisi’s flag-selling ladies got you covered: raincoats to protect from rain, whistles to protect from bad government, and flags to defend from water cannons and maybe impress right people in Brussels, making them more inclined to grant your country the EU candidate status. All in exchange of some pocket money.  Anything you need is there, delivered to your place by women who figured out the least harmful way to profit from Georgia’s political chaos and now carry their business – and the country’s geopolitics – on their carts. All you need is some cash. Can’t afford the raincoat? Then better find yourself a cover, or simply don’t mind the rain: if it can get your hair wet, then it might as well be ruining someone else’s unwelcome wedding party.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiIGh0dHBzOi8vY2l2aWwuZ2UvYXJjaGl2ZXMvNTQzNDUw0gEkaHR0cHM6Ly9jaXZpbC5nZS9hcmNoaXZlcy81NDM0NTAvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Picture: Bang Showbiz  PRINCE Harry has denied having a luxury hotel room he allegedly uses to stay on his own, near his California mansion.  The 38-year-old Duke of Sussex – who has son Archie, 4, and 23-month-old daughter Lilibet with his 41-year-old wife Meghan, Duchess of Sussex – was also reported to have another exclusive hideaway in Los Angeles where he works out and can stay.  But “Page Six” said his representative told the outlet about the claims: “This is not true.”  Harry was said to have a private room “set aside” at a hotel near his and Meghan’s home in Montecito and a spot at San Vicente Bungalows, a private members club in LA with strict rules to protect its guests’ privacy.  The West Hollywood club forbids visitors to take pictures inside the venue and stickers are placed over their phone cameras when they arrive.  Guests are also told not to discuss anything members or their guests see during their visit and they are banned from approaching or interrupting other members in the clubhouse.  Annual fees are £3,200 (about R77.4K) and applicants must be vetted by a panel.  Harry and Meghan quietly celebrated five years of marriage on Friday without posting any pictures on social media.  The pair made headlines after their representative said they were involved in a paparazzi car chase in New York on May 16, who alleged there had been a “relentless pursuit” of the royal couple and this had resulted in “near collisions” involving a slew of other drivers and pedestrians.  City mayor Eric Adams are among the couple’s supporters, and said: “It’s clear that the paparazzi want to get the right shot, they want to get the right story, but public safety must always be at the forefront.”  The mayor added two New York City Police Department officers “could have been injured”.

While department stores usually offer tailoring services (for an additional charge, of course), that’s mostly limited to easy fixes like shortening a hem. More structural fixes like narrowing a pant leg might be available, but that’ll be a much pricier fix and all too often, tell-tale alternation signs are visible in the final product (think: puckering or patterns that don’t line up).  When it comes to made-to-measure suits, the biggest player in the U.S. is Indochino with more than 70 stores. And that is probably because the brand offers high-quality, made-to-measure suits for about the same as many (even non-designer) off-the-rack options.  Fast facts  Men’s and women’s sizing available  Variety of fabrics including a core collection as well as seasonal colors and patterns  You also choose the lining  Choose your lapel shape, number of buttons, pocket style, flap design, etc. for no additional cost  You can also order custom-made shirts, pants, chinos, overcoats, and more with your on-file measurements  Monogramming available  Online ordering also available  Made-to-measure suits start with your measurements so the flat fabric itself is cut to your fit your body. That includes basics like inseam and wingspan, but extends far beyond to things like neck size, bicep circumference, torso length, and where your waist sits. Fitting also involves non-measurement considerations like the slope of your shoulders, the shape of your chest, and even if you slouch.  Have you ever sat down in a pair of pants that uncomfortably cling to your calves and the second you stand up, you have to adjust the leg because it stays bunched up? A knee circumference measurement will help with that. Basically, the suits are cut to fit your body, and not just shortened to how long your legs are.  Since Indoccion makes each suit specifically tailored to your measurements, turnaround time is 3 to 4 weeks. There are 79 locations across North America if you want to get fitted in a showroom or ask a local tailor to take your measurements and input those online if you’d rather not do them yourself.  As for pricing, a two-piece suits starting at $449 for both menswear and womenswear, so while it’s certainly not cheap, it’s actually good deal for a made-to-measure suit (which can cost upwards of $1,000).

According to the Dancing With The Stars judge, the following months will be busy for the both of them, clearly due to their wedding preparations on top of their tour.      Derek Hough Confirms Wedding Timeline  In an Instagram post published on May 7, 2023, Hough confirmed that he and Erbert’s 2023 will be jam-packed. It turns out that this year will not end without the DWTS couple tying the knot.  “Between a Wedding and a 56 City National Tour, it’s gonna be a whirlwind of a year. Hold on tight!!” Hough wrote.  Ahead of this confirmation, fans were aware that this couple didn’t plan to stay engaged for long. Erbert once stated that considering the length of their relationship, it doesn’t “fully make sense” to have a super-long engagement. For her, having to wait for seven years during their dating stage means that they’re “just ready for that next chapter of our lives.”      Naturally, fans cannot wait but to know more about the special day. In the comment section, Hough’s followers expressed their delight about his great news.  “You two are pure magic together!” one person wrote.  Months ago, Hough mentioned that the two of them have already contacted people for the wedding. According to Hough, while both he and Erbert are performers, they are assigning the entertainment aspect of the ceremony to people they know.      “I’m not going to name names right now, but I’ve already asked a few people to perform at the wedding and they’ve already committed. So it’s going to be a full-on festival — I’m very excited about it,” Hough said.  The DWTS judge has also confirmed that fellow DWTS pro and close pal Mark Ballas will serve as his best man.  He Says Nature is a “Must-Have” in Their Special Day  Last month, Hough told US Weekly about some details that he and Herbert are envisioning for the wedding. Interestingly, the professional dancer highly wants to incorporate nature with their special day.  “For me, nature is one of the must-haves,” he said. “I think being in the green [and] in the lush forest and gardens and fields [was] like top of the list.”  Hough also stated that they were interested in putting a live band or a disk jockey during the ceremony. Yet, despite being so busy about their wedding plans, Hough put the process as “going good.”  “What we gravitate towards isn’t always the most lavish option,” he said. “We’re playing with different approaches to certain things so that the day still feels elegant and beautiful and magical, but grounded and down to earth and just approachable.”  Amid wedding preparations, the two are also gearing up for their upcoming multi-city tour. Titled The Symphony of Dance Tour, the duo will be hitting the road throughout North America, stopping at 56 different venues to perform together.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vdGFsZW50cmVjYXAuY29tL2RlcmVrLWhvdWdoLWlzLXR5aW5nLXRoZS1rbm90LXdpdGgtaGF5bGV5LWVyYmVydC1pbi0yMDIzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Mediterranean-inspired estate has hosted fashion types, screen productions, and celebrities.  Highlights this month included the lavish week-long wedding celebrations for Aussie singer, George Sheppard, with new bride, Kathleen Seagar, and an upcoming reality TV series.  The Smiths paid $3.3 million for the 1.31ha Tweed Valley retreat in June 2022, and held it not only as a holiday and events destination, but also a cherished family home.  They relocated from Sydney’s northern beaches with their three children, Jess, 14, Ollie, 12, and Felix, 6.  “We bought it as a business, but the more time we spent up here, we slowly fell in love,” said marketing professional Mr Smith.

The property at 61 Garden Ave, Nunderi is marketed via an expressions of interest campaign with Amir Prestige agent, Justin Haynes.  A sloping driveway from the unassuming street entrance reveals a rendered white-on-white facade set against a wide canvas of tropical foliage to the rear of the triangle-shaped block.  The two-storey floorplan includes three bedrooms, a media room and open-plan living and dining space on the lower level adorned with Peppa Hart’s signature sun silhouettes. A central concrete island bench and butler’s pantry complete the kitchen.  Mrs Smith said: “It’s a great family home. With three kids, they’ve all got their own space. It just works, it flows well.”  Upstairs is a large home office and showstopping master suite with built-in king bed, lavish ensuite, and sweeping balcony.  “The beautiful views waking up in a forest were probably my favourite part of living here,” said Mrs Smith, who managed bookings for the property.  The Smiths weren’t familiar with the Peppa Hart brand, but the home’s European beach bar inspiration resonated with their own recent travels to Greece.  Covered terraces wrap around the home, while the glamorous pool area has a pavilion with woodfired pizza oven, bar and day bed.  At the front of the home, a custom kids’ cubby with rooftop slide is positioned next to an equally whimsical grown-ups’ play space with margarita bar and day bed.  Mr Haynes said the property offered a lifestyle upgrade as well as a potential income stream.  “This luxury residence feels a world away from the urban hustle, yet is actually only 15 minutes from Cabarita Beach, 25min to Coolangatta International Airport and only 40 minutes to Byron Bay,” Mr Haynes said.  “It is truly a unique opportunity to live your best life, with the benefit of an established brand as a coveted lifestyle destination, should the new buyers wish to pursue that avenue.  “We’ve had an incredible response since listing, as this particular property is already excitedly familiar to many, with a high level of early inquiry from interstate buyers and others interested in the design pedigree of this one-of-a-kind estate,” he said.

"wedding","2022-12-12","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-22T03:11:49","Agra: When she accompanied her parents to a mass marriage programme one morning in June 2022, A*, the eldest daughter of a family in Sikandra, a township on the outskirts of Agra in western Uttar Pradesh (UP), expected to be married in a few hours.  Fifty-two couples tied the knot that day at an event sponsored by the Agra Municipal Corporation under the UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana (chief minister mass wedding scheme). A was sent away even though her father, a locksmith by profession, had registered and handed over to the organisers apparel, ornaments, utensils, furniture and a cooking gas cylinder as items the family was giving her as dowry.  According to A’s mother, they may have been sent away as they follow Sikhism, and the weddings solemnised at the event were all conducted by Hindu priests.  A was, however, officially listed as married that day. For more than seven months afterwards, A’s family ran from pillar to post to get Rs 35,000, meant to be deposited into the bank accounts of young women married under this government scheme.  A non-profit organisation that had helped her to register for the scheme took her bank passbook and withdrew the entire sum. The family managed to get the money allegedly on payment of a commission, amounting to more than 10% of the grant, to the non-profit.  A was eventually married at a ceremony arranged by her family nearly six months later, in December 2022.  In a similar case, B and C, cousins in their early twenties, did not have a religious ceremony at the municipality-funded wedding event though they had registered and completed the formalities under the government’s mass marriage scheme. B’s mother said there was no arrangement for a wedding according to Islamic rituals at the venue. The girls were marked as married, but the families had to anyway spend money to organise a nikaah. “We had to get both the girls married later according to the customs of our religion,” she told Article 14.  The UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana, launched in 2017 by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath, offers financial assistance for the marriage ceremony of girls from poor families.  Under the scheme, each married couple is provided a subvention of Rs 51,000—of which Rs 35,000 is given as a cash assistance paid into the bride’s bank account while the remaining sum is meant for expenses including utensils, jewellery for the wedding and for organising the mass wedding event. The scheme is implemented under the supervision of the district magistrate with the responsibility of organising the events entrusted to the social welfare department.  The government website announcing the scheme details does not state if only Hindu wedding ceremonies will be conducted.  Until 2021, as many as 22,780 weddings were registered as having been held through the scheme. As per data on the government website, the budget for the scheme was Rs 125 crore for 2020-21, and Rs 250 crore for Rs 2021-22, growing to Rs 600 crore for the year 2022-23.  However, in case after case that Article 14 investigated, it emerged that middle-men, some masquerading as non-profit organisations, pilfered portions of the financial assistance; couples from religions other than Hinduism found it difficult to be married under the scheme; others struggled to avail the cash assistance.  In other cases, ineligible applicants were included as beneficiaries, a handful of local institutions and individuals worked as intermediaries who took money in advance from applicants in lieu of a promise that the financial assistance under the scheme shall be obtained. In some cases, intermediaries confiscated the beneficiary's bank passbook and ATM cards, and withdrew the money fraudulently.  Widows and divorcees who are remarrying may also apply for assistance under this scheme. Applications require prospective beneficiary women to submit copies of their Aadhaar card, age verification certificate, the bride’s father's income certificate, her bank passbook, and a Below Poverty Line ration card. In some cases, no age verification document was attached, nor sought at the marriage venue.  “We will investigate all cases of fraud brought to our notice,” Agra district magistrate Navneet Singh Chahal told Article 14. “Action will be taken against any officials involved.”  NGO Kept Girl’s Passbook, Withdrew Grant  In the case of A, it was Alka Singh of Alka Welfare Society in Agra who informed the family about the scheme and advised them to submit an application. Under the scheme, local non-profits are given the responsibility of helping local government bodies organise the group wedding events.  A has two younger sisters. Besides grazing sheep and goats with her mother, the girls also contribute towards household income by pasting sequins on plain glass bangles. These are sold in the Agra and Firozabad markets, fetching the girls a paltry Rs 50 for every 165 bangles sold.  A’s sisters dropped out of school several years ago and work to help supplement the family income/ SHIVANI CHAUDHRY    A’s father is a locksmith, her mother works alongside the girls on the bangles.  Until her wedding, A lived with her family in a home of mud and bamboo poles with a tin roof, the only furniture in their 6 feet X 6 feet home being a cot and a trunk to keep clothes.  A picture of Guru Nanak hung on one wall, another of pigeons and a third picture of two swans occupied the other walls, alongside some pictures of movie stars. Near an earthen hearth in the courtyard stood a few goats, tied to old bicycles. On a cot, A’s younger sisters worked with their sequins and bangles.  The girls dropped out of school several years ago..  A said she had given her bank passbook to Singh at the time of filling out the application form. “That's why I could not even check at the bank myself whether the cash had reached my bank account,” she said. After repeated attempts, A and her mother managed to get Singh to come to the Canara Bank’s Bainpur Mustakil branch, where A has an account.  “Madam (Singh) asked me to sign at two places, but I didn't know what those signatures were for,” A told Article 14. Upon enquiring, Singh reportedly told her it was for a KYC (know your customer) verification. The girl returned home, her passbook still with Singh.  A senior clerk in the municipality confirmed to Article 14 that a photocopy of the bride’s passbook is required to be submitted with the application, but not the original bank passbook.  With no update on the cash for weeks, A and her mother visited Singh's office, requesting that the passbook be returned. “My mother and I were humiliated, and I could not understand why she was not giving me my passbook.”  They insisted on getting the passbook, however, and A visited the bank the following morning. On getting the passbook updated, she was told the financial assistance sum had been withdrawn from her account, allegedly by Singh.  A's bank passbook shows that Agra Municipal Corporation deposited Rs 35,000 into her account on 8 September 2022, which was withdrawn on 12 September 2022/ SHIVANI CHAUDHRY  The girl and her mother confronted Singh, who reportedly claimed she had withdrawn the sum to hand over to the family in cash. (The municipal clerk confirmed that under the scheme, the money is deposited in the bride’s account, and nobody is required to withdraw it and hand it over in cash.)  To give the cash, Singh allegedly sought a payment of Rs 11,000 for services provided by her organisation. As tempers flared, Singh reportedly settled for Rs 4,000 of the grant amount of Rs 35,000. As she handed the cash over, her son took a photo, said A.  Speaking to Article 14, Alka Singh denied that she even ran a non-profit, and said she had not filled out any application forms under the mass marriage scheme. “I am a member of a non-governmental organisation named Seva Bharti, and all the volunteers of this NGO are called to attend the mass marriage programme at the wedding venue,” she said.  Singh has been a member of the Seva Bharti group for three years. The Seva Bharati is affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and is the official community service arm for other affiliates.  As per official records, A was married in June 2022 under the UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana. In reality, she was married on 4 December 2022.  As per the transaction entries in A’s bank passbook, the Agra Municipal Corporation deposited Rs 35,000 into her account on 8 September 2022, which was withdrawn on 12 September 2022.  A finally managed to get the cash in the last week of October 2022.  ASHA Worker Forced To Pay Commission To Avail Benefit  Poonam Devi, 41, an accredited social health activist (ASHA), a health worker enabling last-mile delivery of government services for women and children, also got her daughter married under the same scheme, in June 2022.  Poonam Devi told Article 14 that Singh filled the registration form for her daughter's marriage but allegedly misled her about the sum to be received from the government as assistance, claiming that the grant would be Rs 100,000.  She said it was at the wedding venue that Singh told her the grant is in fact Rs 35,000. Singh allegedly told her she would have to deposit her original bank passbook and Rs 11,000 to avail the benefit.  Poonam Devi claimed Singh snatched the bank passbook from her, and a scuffle ensued. “I help all the women and children in this area,” she said, almost in tears. “I didn’t imagine that such a thing would happen to me.”  After several pleas, she said, she paid Rs 6,000 to Singh and left with her daughter’s passbook. ""Due to such incidents, I have lost faith in humanity and government public welfare schemes,” she said.  Alka Singh rejected these allegations too.  A visiting card from a representative of the NGO Alka Welfare Society in Agra.  A pamphlet of the Alka Welfare Society says they work as organisers under the UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana.  Another NGO Cheats Leather Worker  Yashwant Singh, a leather worker living in Khatikpara, Agra, was allegedly duped by staff of Agra's largest non-profit, Chetna Seva Samiti.  Having lost his own shoe-manufacturing factory after the death of his father and eldest brother several years ago, Yashwant Singh, 35, has had to care for his late brother’s three children, his mother and his sister, on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000.  “Worried about the future of my unmarried daughter, we got her married under the UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana,” said Munni Devi, Yashwant Singh’s mother. Relatives had told them about the scheme, meant for women from poor families who could not afford wedding expenses. The family had already found a groom for his sister, Suman, 26.  In April 2022, Yashwant Singh, a relative and the groom's brother visited the office of Chetna Seva Samiti where they filled out the application form for the scheme. They said the NGO’s president Satyaprakash Jaiswal and other co-workers were present in the office at the time.  According to Yashwant Singh, a staff member told them they would have to pay Rs 30,000 with the application form for the mass wedding ceremony, and that the bride’s original bank passbook would have to be submitted too.  A receipt for the Rs 10,000 Yashwant Singh paid to Chetna Sewa Samiti as a ‘donation’.  According to the family, the president of the NGO, Jaiswal, himself told them that the payment was towards marriage expenses and dowry items to be given to the bride along with the grant of Rs 35,000.  Yashwant Singh and the groom's brother together paid Rs 30,000 at the office of the Chetna Seva Samiti and filled out the application form. They also left behind Suman’s bank passbook.  Under the scheme, NGOs help organise the mass wedding ceremonies and make people aware about the scheme, but are not authorised to charge any fee from beneficiaries.  Suman was married in June 2022 under the UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana. Nearly a year later, the financial assistance under the scheme has not yet been deposited into her bank account.  Yashwant Singh said he has visited the office of Chetna Seva Samiti more than 20 times. “I am wasting my time and the transportation cost, but I don’t have any answer why the sum has not been deposited,” he told Article 14.  Additionally, he was allegedly asked to pay Rs 2,000 to get his sister’s passbook back. “I have been robbed,” he said.  Jaiswal told Article 14 that the UP government did give a contract to his NGO to conduct mass marriages under the government scheme, but in addition, he had been conducting mass marriages through his organisation for seven years. “So far, about 7,500 girls have been married under my NGO,” he said.  He took money from those couples whose weddings his NGO arranged, he said— Rs 20,000 from the groom’s side and Rs 10,000 from the bride’s side. “We give them a dowry of Rs 1 lakh, but we do not take any cash payment from the couples married under the chief minister’s scheme.” Jaiswal said agents who fill out forms for mass marriages may have extorted money from applicants.  No Arrangements For Muslim Couples  B and C, cousins in their early twenties, were listed as beneficiaries of the scheme in November 2021, though both girls had wedding ceremonies later.  B’s date of birth as per her Aadhaar card is 1 January 1999, while C’s date of birth is given as 1 January 2003. More than a year later, neither girl has received the cash assistance under the scheme.  C’s mother said rituals at the mass wedding event were all as per Hindu customs only, and the families organised nikaah ceremonies for the girls later.  B’s mother told Article 14 that only copies of their Aadhaar cards, bank pass books and passport size photographs were sought, not age verification documents were requested or supplied.  Grant Paid to Couple Who Were Not Married  D, 26 years old, applied to be a beneficiary under the scheme in June 2022.  Residents of Agra, she and her fiancée attended the mass marriage event, signed a confirmation for their marriage and departed from the wedding hall. Neither the bride nor the groom wore a wedding dress. They were not married, D said, and yet the financial assistance of Rs 35,000 was transferred to the girl’s bank account.  Article 14 found that D gave her bank passbook and ATM card to her fiance, who operated a public services centre in Shahganj, in Agra. He withdrew the financial assistance paid by the government and subsequently refused to marry her, though their registration was approved at the event.  D’s family has struggled on multiple fronts. Her father died in 2012. They lost their house in Shahganj due to indebtedness.  D and her mother moved to a relative’s home while her younger brother works in Rajasthan.  “I was not married according to customs at the wedding venue, but the money reached my bank account, about which Arun had not informed me,” D told Article 14. “He did several transactions from my bank account. And now he doesn't talk to me. He abuses me and behaves indecently.”  D's bank passbook shows the Agra Municipal Corporation deposited the grant on 6 September 2022.  D has not shifted into his home as Arun's family and relatives did not acknowledge the registration at the mass marriage event. Her own family also wants her to get married again as per social customs. “We don't have the money to get married again.”  In any case, Arun was not interested, she said, and either quarrels at the mention of a wedding or avoids it. “He betrayed me.”  D said she did not receive a marriage certificate and so could not challenge his behaviour publicly.  Naresh Paras, an Agra-based women and child rights activist, said that the government scheme D was married under includes a provision to provide a marriage certificate to married couples. “Cases of domestic violence and harassment can increase due to not providing a marriage certificate in the mass marriage ceremony,” Paras told Article 14. “There can also be trouble in initiating court cases, etc.”  Bogus Couples: Same Phone Number For Over 30 Couples  In the years 2021 and 2022, 81 couples were married at Agra Municipal Corporation’s mass wedding events under the scheme.  In at least 38 cases, mobile numbers of the married couples appeared to be fake. The same mobile number was listed against 31 couples.  A list of the beneficiaries of the UP Mukhayamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana 2021-22 released by the Agra Municipal Corporation shows several bogus mobile numbers.  On calling these numbers, the scheme beneficiaries refused to speak to Article 14.  Right To Information activist Naresh Paras sought details from the administration of two dozen districts on the implementation of the scheme and the list of beneficiaries. None has shared the information.  The Agra Municipal Corporation’s health officer told Paras that he would need to pay Rs 2,000 for photostats and would also have to attach an affidavit citing a reason for seeking the information as well as declaring that the information would not be misused.  Under the Right To Information (RTI) Act, 2005, applicants are not required to state a reason for seeking information. Paras has filed his first appeal against the order of the public information officer.  January 1: A Common Birth Date For Beneficiaries  E, aged 22, was married under the UP Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Yojana in November 2021, also at an event organised by the Agra Municipal Corporation.  More than a year later, the grant money has not yet been deposited in her account. Her date of birth, as per her Aadhaar card, is 1 January, 1999.  Upon investigation, it emerged that a large number of young women married under the scheme had 1 January or 1 March as their date of birth.  In many Aadhaar cards, the birth dates of the mother, father, daughter and the groom are given as 1 January.  A said that for registration, she submitted only her bank passbook, Aadhaar card and passport-sized photo. A told Article 14 she was afraid her application may be rejected because she was very young, and so she updated her age on her Aadhaar card by filling out the required form and getting it signed by a local councillor.  Poonam Devi also submitted only a bank passbook, Aadhaar card and passport-sized photo for her daughter’s marriage application.  The Punjab and Haryana high court ruled in 2021 that an Aadhaar card cannot be a proof of age verification as anyone may change registered information in their Aadhaar card at any time .  The activist Paras, who has been campaigning against child marriage, said Aadhaar cards frequently have an incorrect date of birth, and that young girls’ age must be verified on the basis of birth certificate, education certificate or a medical examination.  “None of these documents is being taken with the applications for beneficiaries of the mass marriage events,” he said. “All married couples’ age should be verified and action should be taken against culprits if a minor is found to have been married under a government scheme.”  * Names of some of the brides were changed to protect their identity.

The Duke of Sussex said he wanted to meet the crowds the evening before his wedding, but claimed William was initially not keen on the idea. Harry and Meghn celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary on Friday after the couple tied the knot in a glittering ceremony at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle. It was also the day five years ago that William stood side-by-side with his younger brother as he welcomed his bride Meghan down the aisle, with the rest of the Royal Family in attendance. But tensions appeared to rise between Harry and William on the eve of the royal wedding, with the duke left ""feeling sick"" following an exchange with the now Prince of Wales.

William had only recently become a dad for the third time, and Harry claimed he had been due to join the group but cancelled at the ""last minute"" citing ""Kate and the kids"". Harry wrote he reminded his older brother on the night before his wedding to Kate, Princess of Wales that the pair had dinner together before greeting waiting crowds outside. The Duke of Sussex claims William then shot back: ""Why are you even saying hello to the crowds, Harold?"" To which Harry in response admitted in the book: ""I felt sick about it.""

Sweet, sweet Joel! What have you done? It was only time before Somebody Somewhere put Joel and Sam’s friendship to the test, and that test begins right now with “NMB NMP.” It’s awful and I hate it, by which I mean it’s completely gutting and there aren’t enough tini-tinis in the world to make it okay. And this is only the beginning!  The episode, written by Rachel Axler and directed by Lennon Parham, wisely kicks off by reminding us how special Sam and Joel’s relationship is. They’re goofing off in the car, talking about their own dream weddings. Joel’s includes Sam singing Laura Branigan’s ’80s banger “Gloria” while he walks down the aisle. Sam initially balks at the idea of attempting to take on the late icon — she lives by a simple singing rule: “No Barbra, no Judy, no Branigan” — but the pull is too strong, and before long, we’re all calling Gloria. Although reluctant to even admit to having thought about her own wedding, Sam says she’d want to wear her mother’s wedding dress, and yes, she realizes there’s a real height discrepancy there. “Me, my mom’s dress, and my beaver walking down the aisle to meet the man of our dreams,” she tells Joel. This moment, paired with Joel and Sam meeting Fred and Tiffani at the tailor’s for their tuxedo fittings, is, I think, the reason people are so endeared to this show. They’re such authentic displays of friendship — so warm and fun, and you just want to be around these people as long as possible. They’re also the perfect setup for the emotional gut punch of watching that friendship be put in danger. Am I being dramatic about this? I don’t care! The thought of Sam and Joel in a fight is keeping me up at night, okay?  At the tailor’s, Joel is a little coy about his plans for the day — Sam’s looking for help baking Tricia a birthday cake — and one weird FaceTime later, in which Joel’s face covers the entire screen (I’m still laughing about it, honestly, the perfect cover-up), we learn that he’s on a secret date with Brad Schraeder, née SLS. Oh, this date, you guys! This date is so adorable. These two nerds are hanging out at a historical house in Manhattan, and they couldn’t be more excited about it. I never thought I’d find the sentence “I could listen to you talk about the Kansas-Nebraska Act all day” romantic, but here we are! Joel can’t help but plant a big ol’ kiss on Brad, and friends, it looks like this relationship has gone legit. That’s exciting, of course, but the moment Brad asks Joel to have a meal at the Chef with him — the place where Joel and Sam regularly grab breakfast — you know this whole thing is about to blow up.  It doesn’t take long. When Sam shows up at the Chef waiting for Joel and the waiter says he has Joel’s windbreaker that he left there yesterday when he was in with “Mr. Schraeder,” she knows exactly what’s going on. She leaves. Then, when Joel shows up and is informed that Sam left and has the windbreaker, he knows she knows. He probably is bracing himself a little bit for what he’s walking into when he goes to see Sam face-to-face, but there’s no way he’s totally prepared for Sam’s reaction. If looks could kill, my babies! Poor Joel tries to act casual, tossing in a “guess the secret’s out” and trying to tell Sam that she’d actually really like Brad, but Sam wants exactly none of it. She’s so angry she can barely speak. All she musters is to tell Joel to take his windbreaker and leave. It’s rough. The camera lingers on Sam sitting alone in her kitchen, stewing as she tries to eat some of her takeout breakfast. What a sad little tableau.  Taken alone, it would be easy to decide that Sam’s overreacting, to say the very least. Sure, Joel shouldn’t keep secrets from his best friend, but in the grand scheme of things it’s not that big of a deal, and Sam should be happy that her friend has found someone. But the situation is more complicated than that. What Joel doesn’t know is that he is actually the second person Sam deeply trusts that, in the span of a few hours, she’s learned has kept something important a secret from her. And both for the same reason: They didn’t think Sam would be able to handle the news they had to share. From her reactions to both, it seems like maybe they were right. So, if Joel is one of those people Sam’s feeling betrayed by, who is the other? It’s Sam’s late sister Holly.  It’s a real shame because Sam and Tricia have never gotten along better and it all goes to shit pretty quickly — much like the cake Sam tries to bake for Tricia’s 47th birthday. Sam tells Joel that she wants to make her sister a funeral cake like they used to have as kids because it’s Tricia’s first birthday without Rick and Shannon is off at school. She calls it “a tender gesture,” and she’s not wrong. It’s thoughtful and 100 percent the thought that counts here because Sam is a terrible baker. She knows it and I applaud her bravery for going in anyway. The confidence she has to just wing it is a thing to behold. The recipe calls for room-temperature butter, and she decides to put it in the microwave instead. She needs to add vegetable oil, and this woman just sprays some nonstick spray into the bowl instead of using the vegetable oil right in front of her. “That should be good,” she says. Someone get Bridget Everett a cooking show and someone do it soon.  The thing is, Tricia is still grateful for Sam trying to make the day special, even if the cake turns out like, as Sam calls it, “a big hot dump.” After the sisters share a few laughs about Tricia’s fancy new fridge and Sam’s terrible, somehow very wet cake — “Well, wet is never bad. Oh, you should put that on a pillow.” — Tricia thanks her sister for making an effort and keeping this day light. She admits she’s really been dreading her 47th birthday since it’s the same age Holly was when she was diagnosed with cancer. Sam thinks Tricia’s confused, Holly was 48, but it doesn’t take long for Sam to realize she’s the confused one. This escalates quickly. Tricia tries to explain that Holly kept her diagnosis a secret from Sam because she was trying to protect her — she didn’t think Sam could handle it and she didn’t want to put her through it. Tricia thought keeping that information from her was wrong, but it was Holly’s choice. Sam is so upset, and as much as these two have pretended not to really understand one another, ooohh, buddy, does Tricia get Sam. She knows that Sam wants to leave, and she’s right. She tries to stop her, pleading with Sam not to go, not to cut her out because that’s what she always does. When someone makes “a tiny mistake,” she cuts them out. “You cut people out, Sam,” she yells, almost heartbroken. “You cannot keep doing that; there won’t be anyone left.” And still, Sam goes, and Tricia’s left all alone crying over the sink. It’s wild how fast this show can move from laugh-out-loud funny to achingly real and never miss a beat. The buildup to Sam storming out is so deftly done, and if people aren’t winning awards for this scene alone, what are we even doing here?  Back at home, Sam looks at all the memories of Holly that surround her — her initials scratched in the piano — until she sits down and cries. Bridget Everett in this moment, you guys! Similarly to that scene in the premiere when Sam cries thinking about her dad as she cleans the barn, the camera just lets Everett do her thing here. Eventually, Sam takes off Holly’s necklaces, and the next morning we see that she decided to sleep on the couch again instead of in Holly’s bed. She’s cutting her out, just like Tricia said she would, just like she’s trying to do to Joel. Here’s hoping Sam breaks her habit before it’s too late.  Tender Moments  •When Sam first comes home from the big fight with Tricia, Darlene is there to give Sam her cassette from her last vocal lesson. Sam apologizes for running out, but there’s no need to apologize to this angel! Darlene gets it: “Isn’t it strange, something that brings us so much joy can be almost too much to bear?” Sam gives her a long hug, you can tell Sam really needs it. “Keep singing, Sam. We need you,” Darlene says as she goes. Give this woman Teacher of the Year or something!  • Tricia goes to a local party-rental store to start reserving items for Fred and Susan’s wedding, but the owner, Heather, refuses her business. At first, Tricia assumes Heather has an issue with Fred and immediately defends him and that’s called growth, baby. But Heather doesn’t know Fred — she does know, however, that Charity told her all about how Tricia tried to hook up with Coop. After Tricia’s done cackling at the absurdity of Charity trying to tarnish her name, she calls Charity a skank and makes a joke about her spreading rumors and her legs, and I’m so glad not all of old Tricia is gone.  • As someone whose college pregame playlist included Laura Branigan’s “Gloria” in steady rotation, I was thrilled to see it get a shout-out here. Will Somebody Somewhere do for Laura Branigan what Stranger Things did for Kate Bush? I sure hope so.  • Petition for Joel and Brad to double-date with Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.  • Drunk on her birthday and ignoring calls and texts from Rick, Tricia decides to tag Charity in a “Lying Cunt” pillow Instagram post. It’s about time, Tricia.  • Tricia’s fancy refrigerator can also play music, and her choice to dance alone in her kitchen to Joan Armatrading’s “Show Some Emotion” is perfect.  • Sam thinks Tricia should name her new pillow company “Charity Cases,” and I second that.  • “Sick! Oh, my god, I can’t believe I said ‘sick.’”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZ1bHR1cmUuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc29tZWJvZHktc29tZXdoZXJlLXJlY2FwLXNlYXNvbi0yLWVwaXNvZGUtNS1ubWItbm1wLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Five couples performed their marriage rites at Baan Hongyok today (May 21), contributing to the preservation and promotion of the old traditions of Peranakan, or Straits Chinese.  This term refers to the descendants of the early waves of Southern Chinese immigrants to Southeast Asia, who initially settled in the British Colonial-ruled ports in the Malay Peninsula and later migrated to other destinations, such as Phuket.  The traditional Chinese Wedding events today also featured a street procession along Thepkrasattri Rd. The participants, adorned in vintage attire, walked from the Hongyok Mansion to the Thai Hua Museum, which was Phuket’s first school offering classes in Hokkien Chinese.  ""It promotes soft power and local culture as we hope the pictures from the event will become viral social media content worldwide, thereby advancing cultural tourism and supporting our goal of having Peranakan costumes recognized as world heritage,"" stated the Phuket Provincial Office of the PR Department of Thailand.

PHOTO| COURTESY      Renowned Kenyan singer and entrepreneur, Esther Akoth, popularly known as Akothee, has expressed her concern over the attendance of her two sons at her forthcoming second wedding ceremony.  Her sons, who live in France, missed her first wedding due to their academic commitments.  Akothee revealed the dilemma in an emotional social media post. “He is not saying anything, not asking questions about my royal fairytale wedding. Now, how do I start this conversation about their attendance at the second ceremony? Should I send an email?” she shared, referring to the communication with her ex-partner.  The artiste’s first wedding was held in April in Kiambu, Kenya, and her sons, Prince Ojwang and Prince Oyoo, were noticeably absent.  However, she has assured her fans that they will be present at her second wedding scheduled for July 10 in Switzerland where the groom’s family is located.  “The only people who will miss my wedding are my two sons who will not make it because of school rules, but they will witness the one which is scheduled to take place on July 10,” she said during her Kiambu wedding.  The mother to five children also shared plans to transport her entire bridal party to Switzerland for a secondary wedding celebration in July.  The vibrant singer disclosed through social media platforms that the ceremony is scheduled for July 10, 2023, with the same bridal party expected to be in attendance.  “I present to you The Royal Bridal Party, our exceptional team, who will be traveling to Switzerland for the ‘Esther Weds Denis’ ceremony on July 10, 2023.  This entire YEAR is dedicated to my wedding celebrations, so start your planning for next year,” she enthusiastically announced.  In a candid post in the past, Akothee lauded her baby daddy, Dominique Wuon Oyoo, for his supportive role towards her children, notably, her daughter, Fancy Makadia.  “When I met Dominique Wuon Oyoo, he embraced my children. Fancy Makadia found a dad. He’s a selfless guy and a ride-or-die,” she said.  Akothee has also in the past faced some family drama with her second baby daddy, Markus Urs Meyer, the father of her son, Ojwang.  Markus, who she claims abandoned her during pregnancy, sought custody for their son.

Priests or pandits conduct Hindu weddings as per the religious rituals. They chant different mantras and make the brides and grooms take the wedding vows. The significance of these mantras and religious rituals certainly hold importance since time immemorial.  The brides and grooms take seven wedding vows during the puja. Each of the vows has its own significance.  Here we bring you a video of a Hindu wedding that has recently stormed the internet. The video will certainly leave you stunned and rolling on the floors, laughing.  As seen in the video, a pandit along with others is sitting on the wedding mandap. The bride is also seen sitting close to the ‘Havan kund’.    However, instead of chanting the shlokas or mantras, the pandit starts singing, “Saath Rahenge, Saat Janam Tak... Aao Yeh Khayen Kasam…(Let’s take an oath that we will live together for seven births)”  As the pandit completes the lyrics, another person is heard repeating the same line with music playing in the background.  Later, the pandit says, “When he saw her for the first time, Vinayak took an oath. Do you know which oath he took?”  मार्केट में नए पंडित जी आ चुके हैं 😂😂😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/JA9yspSflp — Hasna Zaroori Hai 🇮🇳 (@HasnaZarooriHai) May 10, 2023  The pandit continues, “Tumhe Apna Banane Ki Kasam, Khai Hai, Khai Hai… Haan Khai Hai…” This left the relatives, guests, friends and all others at the wedding cheering loud.  Again, the unseen person starts repeating the lyrics.  As the camera pans towards the guests witnessing the wedding, a few among them start singing the lyrics in chorus.  The pandit again continues, when Nandini saw him (Vinayak) for the first time, she also developed a feeling.  Describing her feelings, the Pandit says, “Tu mera hai sanam, tu hi mera humdum, tere saang jeena aab saaton janam.”  This time, a girl joined the man and starts repeating the lyrics of the song.    The video shared on Twitter by Hasna Zaroori Hai has gone viral on social media triggering a laugh riot among users.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vb2Rpc2hhdHYuaW4vbmV3cy92aXJhbC90dW1oZS1hcG5hLWJhbmFuZS1raS1rYXNhbS1wYW5kaXQtcy1tZWxvZGlvdXMtd2VkZGluZy12b3dzLXdpbGwtbGVhdmUteW91LXN0dW5uZWQtd2F0Y2gtMjA0ODk30gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vb2Rpc2hhdHYuaW4vbmV3cy92aXJhbC90dW1oZS1hcG5hLWJhbmFuZS1raS1rYXNhbS1wYW5kaXQtcy1tZWxvZGlvdXMtd2VkZGluZy12b3dzLXdpbGwtbGVhdmUteW91LXN0dW5uZWQtd2F0Y2gtMjA0ODk3L2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","1854-04-06","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T15:03:00","The mother, her son and the daughter in law.  Love, marriage rituals, and a wedding theft  Jonathan Smyth looks at some old marriage customs and the theft of clothes in Ballyjamesduff to attend a wedding in his latest Times Past column...  Frank ‘Ol blue eye’ Sinatra, sang manys the love song and one of his favourites was ‘Love and Marriage’, with its rhyming lyrics: 'Love and marriage, love, and marriage, Go together like a horse and carriage. This I tell ya, brother, you can't have one without the other', and so forth.  A myriad of marriage customs are found all over the world, and have the most unlikely of origins and many more that are purely an Irish invention.  In days gone by, carrying his bride across the threshold, was for the man, as old a custom as could be found anywhere in the world. Who doesn’t remember the John Wayne flick, ‘The Quiet Man’ where he carries the feisty Maureen O’Hara through the front door of their new home. Of course, a similar scene is repeated in countless films and novels. The tradition has an unlikely beginning and can be traced back to the ancient world of the Romans where it was a less than pleasant activity associated with the cruelty of the Roman soldiers who took women captive before carrying them over the threshold. These days, the custom is no longer as popular amongst newly married couples.  The Claddagh ring  Walt Disney the great movie-making owner of Disney Studios, and his wife, both wore matching claddagh rings to symbolise their undying love. However, the Irish Claddagh ring is no ordinary piece of jewellery and recently, it was explained to me that there are three positions that the rings can be worn that will show a person's status, whether they be single, searching for love, engaged or married. When worn on the left hand with the heart facing outwards, it symbolises that the person is engaged. Whereas, if the heart is facing inwards, then that signifies they are married. But if the ring is placed on the right hand with the heart facing out, it means that the person is single and searching for love.  Similarly, if you saw the ring on the right hand with the heart turned inwards, it means the individual is in a committed relationship.  Child of Prague  The Child of Prague is considered to be sacred by many and a tradition began where the figure was placed outside on the evening before a wedding to stop rain from falling on the big day, and to persuade some sun to shine. When Pierce Brosnan, the Navan-born James Bond actor, married his bride Keely Shaye Smith at Ballintubber Abbey, Co Mayo, he wanted to make certain that there’d be no downpour bucketing down to ruin the reception later at Ashford Castle. On the previous evening, he slipped out of the hotel in the middle of the night to place the Child of Prague in a bush beside Ashford Castle.  The white dress  Did you know that the trend for white wedding dresses was begun by England’s Queen Victoria who they say, wanted to show-off the white lace she was wearing when she married Prince Albert.  In the old days, a groom gave his bride a silver coin to symbolise the equal sharing of his wealth with her. Quite often parents passed a coin on to the eldest son. In some cases nowadays, partners exchange coins and, if the metal should clink together, then that meant a lot of luck was to come their way. The exchange was accompanied by the words ‘I give this as a token of all I possess’.  The custom of the coin has its origin in the ancient practice of providing a marriage dowry. But of course, it is not all about money.  Somebody once asked the married American poet Dorothy Parker: ""What makes you think you’ve got the perfect husband?""  She replied: ""Well he remembers my birthday but forgets my age!"" Now that is sound advice indeed.  Stolen wedding ‘duds’  A wedding wouldn’t be the same without a new outfit to wear for the occasion. According to this paper, on April 6, 1854, on the day before a wedding, Rose Molloy was charged with going in to Miss Gibson, of Ballyjamesduff, on false pretences to get herself expensive clothes, which she made out were for Miss Hogg from Fintervin, and to convince the shopkeeper she produced ‘an order in writing’ which she said came from Miss Hogg, but the letter was in reality a forgery. Afterwards, Molloy was swiftly arrested.  Having acted like a total gombeen, she told the police she needed new clothes to wear at her brother's wedding and that, given the chance, would have paid back Miss Gibson. In any case, Miss Gibson was repaid and thankfully ‘sustained no loss from the transaction’.  In addition to being compensated, Miss Gibson and her solicitor, Mr Tully, attested to the previous good character of Rose Molloy, while Mr Knipe was certain that if his client pleaded guilty, she’d be let off and ‘set free’.  Miss Molloy had the option of paying a 20-shilling fine or spending a fortnight behind bars. The fine we are told was promptly paid.  Advice  In 1853, there were books full of advice to help you get yourself ready for marriage, and for the couples who had the money to buy the first four copies of 'The Family Treasury,' they would be set back by 2d. per edition. There were many tips to help the young couples to know what to expect on the day itself whether they be ‘Dissenter, Catholic, or Quaker'.  And for any runaway partners, there was choice advice on how to get married in Gretna Green, which offered some consolation to runaway lovebirds.  The other day I saw a bumper sticker with these heart-warming words emblazoned across it: ‘No love is greater than the love of an Irish mother’. However, there are also the countless mother-in-law jokes from the other side of the coin. One that I thought was particularly humorous was from a daughter-in-law who wrote: ‘Dear mother-in-law, I don’t need you to teach me how to handle my children. I’m living with one of yours and he still needs quite a lot of improvement.’  READ MORE TIMES PAST  The Cavan and Monaghan Lunatic Asylum and a father’s hope","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFuZ2xvY2VsdC5pZS8yMDIzLzA1LzIxL2xvdmUtbWFycmlhZ2Utcml0dWFscy1hbmQtYS13ZWRkaW5nLXRoZWZ0L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Actress Anju Kurian reacted by writing, “True inspiration”. One user wrote, “नाचने के लिए पांव नही। खुशी चहिए”. Another added, “Instagram mein Sabse pyari video”. The third said, “Me dhekh rone lga😢😢😢 kuch bhi sambhav hai”. See some more reactions here:-  Instagram  A major part of the song Chogada is inspired by several Gujarati folklore sung during the festival of Navratri.  The one that’s playing in the viral video featured Ayush Sharma and Warina Hussain shaking their legs to the beats of Lijo George and Dj Chetas. The lyrics were revamped by Darshan Raval and Shabbir Ahmed and the former even sang the song alongside Asees Kaur.  For the unversed, this film Loveyatri was initially titled Loveratri which saw a major backlash by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad for allegedly distorting the meaning of the Hindu festival, Navratri. Ayush later in an interview with PTI revealed that his or the maker's intentions were never on the wrong lane.  Also Read: Crew, Passengers Perform Garba On 'Chogada' At Mumbai Airport, Video Goes Viral  Sharma expressed, “Our intention was very clear. We wanted a film that connects with most people. There was unnecessary conversation and objection happening over it. The film will not hurt anyone’s sentiments. There is not one double-meaning dialogue in the film, it only talks about culture. Something or some elements had a problem.”  “I don’t want to win the box office with a controversy. I don’t think getting controversy or adding tension would have worked in my favour. I am not publicity hungry. I have enough publicity through the film. I don’t need unnecessary attention and I don’t want anybody else to get the attention, so if you have a problem, we will change it (title).

"wedding","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Delhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T10:14:03","— Sana Jamal  The advent of the Internet, the emergence of new-age technologies and evolving educational system have fuelled the rise of unconventional career options. Gone are the days when an engineer and a doctor were the only coveted career options available to the youth. Today, even your favourite pastime can be turned into a full-time vocation. Some of these unconventional career options are given below:  Image Consultant  An image consultant is a professional who manages the image and its elements, such as appearance, behaviour and communication of individuals and companies. It involves an understanding of who the client is, their personal and professional goals and his characteristic traits. The minimum eligibility is Class 12, followed by a course in communication and certification in image management. Aspirants should have excellent interpersonal skills, sound management skills and a passion for fashion.  Some of the notable image consultants are Renu Mehra, Nidhi Jagtiani, Neha Gupta and Samira Gupta, among other.  Courses and institutes  There are several short-term courses available in this domain. Some of the institutes offering an image management course are as follows:  — Image Consulting Business Institute, New Delhi  — Indian School of Image Management, Mumbai  — Pearl Academy, New Delhi  — International Image Consulting Institute, New Delhi  Salary and prospects:  There are several career options available in image consulting, including fashion blogger, beauty pageant and event stylist, jewellery and accessory stylist, bridal and wedding stylist, celebrity stylist, grooming and etiquette coach, corporate trainer and many more. A good image is the demand of the 21st century, and hence image consultants are sought-after by celebrities, corporates, politicians, companies, influencers, artists and many more.  Some of the top recruiters in this industry include Image Redefined, Suits Me, Style Puzzle, DressLife and many more.  Advertisement  The starting salary is Rs 10,000 to 15,000 monthly, which upgrades with experience. Staying up-to-date with the latest fashion trends, strong networking skills and taking specialised courses will help you stay ahead of your peers.  Doodle Artist  Do you know that doodling on the last pages of the notebook during lectures is now a full-time career option? Although a doodle appears to consist of simple abstract patterns and lines, these elements have a representational meaning. Doodling is an excellent option for presenting information graphically. Creativity, a flair for design, and sound knowledge of design tools are necessary for this profession. Doodle artists are employed by print houses, magazines, comics, animation companies, merchandising outlets, fashion houses and FMCG firms.  Courses and institutes  To become a doodle artist, one can choose courses such as Bachelor in Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor’s in Visual Communication or Bachelor’s in Communication Design after Class 12. Try to gain an internship early on and gain relevant experience. Showcasing your portfolio on Behance and Pinterest always helps. Some of the institutions that can be the gateway to your doodling career are:  — National Institute of Design  — Indian Institute of Art and Design  — Pearl Academy  — National Institute of Fine Arts  Salary and prospects:  Advertisement  A doodle artist can work as a creative technologist, graphic recordist, comic book artist, whiteboard animator, children’s book illustrator, etc. They are highly in demand by creative and advertising agencies, film and production houses, media, gaming and entertainment firms. As a novice, you can expect a minimum salary of Rs 2.8 lakhs per annum which can go up to Rs 15-20 lakhs, depending upon your experience.  Tea Tasters  If you are a tea lover and looking to pursue it as a career option, choose tea tasting as your career. Tea tasters assess the quality of tea by tasting before scale and exploring blending options. A typical tea taster might taste around 100 samples daily during the peak season. Tea tasters are thoroughly abreast of tea production and trends, and can reveal much about tea merely by examining leaves.  Courses and institutes  There are currently no full-fledged courses available in tea tasting. However, the demand has spurred short-term certifications, which can be helpful. A Class 12 degree in science followed by a bachelor’s in Botany, Horticulture, Agricultural Sciences, and Food Science is a good starting point. Subsequently, candidates can opt for specialised courses in tea management. An in-depth understanding of the tea industry, strong sensory skills and decision-making skills are vital for tea tasters. Some of the institutes offering tea-tasting courses in India include  — Assam Agricultural University  — Dipras Institute of Professional Studies, Kolkata  — Darjeeling Tea Research and Management Association, Darjeeling  — University of North Bengal, Darjeeling  — Birla Institute of Management and Futuristic Studies, Kolkata  — Indian Institute of Plantation Management, Bangalore  Salary and prospects:  Many companies employ tea tasters to ensure quality and prepare specialised blends. Tea Tasters find jobs in plantations as well as tea trading businesses. You may also consider starting your own tea brand. Tea tasters earn around Rs 3 lakh per month, while specialists can easily expect a salary of Rs 6 lakh per annum.  Wedding Planner  Wedding planners plan ‘the special day’ for people by taking care of all arrangements such as venue, décor, guest lists, music, and catering. A typical job of a wedding planner begins with a consultation and deciding on specifics, followed by research, contracting, planning the flow of events and implementation. With destination weddings gaining momentum, wedding planners get to travel to exotic locations. Moreover, evolving wedding trends such as sustainability, limited guest lists, and demand for personalization have given a fillip to wedding planning as a career option. Wedding planners should have sound knowledge of aesthetics, good management skills, and an eye for detail and creativity.  Courses and institutes:  Advertisement  A bachelor’s degree in Event Management or Hospitality and Tourism Management can be the gateway to your career in wedding planning. Several institutes are offering short-term courses in the domain, which will add brownie points to your profile. Some of the institutes offering courses in wedding planning include:  — Pearl Academy, Delhi and Noida  — Tritya Institute of Event Management, New Delhi  — Wedding Management Institute, New Delhi  Salary and prospects:  In India, people are willing to go the extra mile to make their weddings special. Wedding planners work in event management firms, wedding planning agencies, hotels and creative agencies. Some of the top recruiters include Devika Narain&Company, Savya Weddings, DeamKraftz, etc.  Advertisement  The salary of an entrant typically varies from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per month. A full-fledged wedding planner typically charges 10-15 per cent of the total wedding cost.  Food Stylists  If you credit photographers for making food look enticing in photographs, think again. Besides photographs, food stylists also play an important role in making food look attractive through garnishing, dressing and presentation skills. Flair for design, excellent photography and photo editing skills, and understanding of the colour palette and aesthetics are crucial skills for this profession. As a food stylist, you can work with magazines, advertising companies, photographers, restaurants, or freelancers.  Courses and institutes:  Advertisement  A degree in hotel management, culinary management and food service management comes in handy for this career. The minimum eligibility for these courses is Class 12 from any discipline with a minimum aggregate of 50 per cent marks. Some of the reputed institutes include  — Institute of Hotel Management, Catering and Nutrition, New Delhi  — Amity University, New Delhi  — Galgotias University, Noida  — UEI Global, New Delhi  Salary and prospects:  Food and hospitality are booming industries, with new food chains and fast-food joints opening almost every month. Most of these food chains are increasingly investing in their social media presence, increasing the demand for food stylists. As per Glassdoor, food stylists typically start with an average salary of Rs 16,000 per month, which increases with experience.  There are umpteen career options available to youth today. What is common among all these unconventional career choices is that they involve more skills, passion and innovation rather than pursuing specific educational background or a career path. So, if you dare to think beyond the obvious, opt for unconventional career paths where the sky is the limit.

In a trailer for the upcoming season, which will be released on May 25, Kourtney lashes out at her sister as she accuses the SKIMS founder of using her her wedding to Travis Barker as a ""business opportunity"".  Kourtney and Travis tied the knot last year in the beautiful coastal village of Portofino, Italy, with their wedding sponsored by Dolce & Gabbana.  Just months later however, Kim was unveiled as the face of the fashion brand's Spring/Summer 2023 ad campaign.  ""People think it's a misunderstanding, it's not. It's who she is to her core,"" Kourtney said in the trailer as she went on a scathing rant about Kim.  It's safe to say the new Hulu series will be full of drama, but it's not the first time the famous sisters have been caught up in an apparent feud.  Here, we take a look back at some of Kourtney and Kim's biggest rows.  Kim's diamond earring devastation  Image: E!) E!)  Kim was devastated back in 2011 when her expensive diamond earring was lost in the ocean, but Kourtney was far from sympathetic.  The famous family were enjoying a trip to Bora Bora, but disaster struck for Kim when she lost the $75,000 (£60,000) piece of jewellery and she was left in tears.  Kim was thrown into the water by her husband-at-the-time Kris Humphries and her earring came lose after landing in the ocean.  Image: E!) E!)  She screamed: ""My earring's gone! F**k, oh my God I'm gonna cry. My diamond earring,"" before adding: ""We're not going to find it in the ocean.""  While Kim managed to gain sympathy from her momager Kris Jenner, sister Kourtney was less than impressed.  Appearing from one of the family's huts to see what all of the commotion was about, she scolded: ""Kim, there's people that are dying.""  Cruel appearance jibe  Image: E!) E!)  Things got nasty during a 2018 fight between Kim and Kourtney, as the family tried to organise their annual Christmas cars photoshoot.  While Kim tried to schedule a date, Kourtney said she was unavailable and refused to adjust her schedule to accommodate for Kim's business meetings.  ""I'm leaving at 4pm and I don't care what anyone says,"" Kourtney insisted.  Kim explained to their mother: ""That was when my meeting was.""  As Kourtney suggested Kim should change her meeting to 7am, Kim became increasingly annoyed and shouted: ""Get the f**k out of here and go.  Image: E!) E!)  ""No one wants you in the f***ing shoot. I'm planning this, so we don't want you in the shoot.""  Kourtney hit back and said she didn't care about the shoot.  Eventually, Kim had enough and shouted: ""Maybe if you had a f**king business that you were passionate about then you would know what it takes to run a f**king business, but you don't. So don't even act like you know what I'm talking about.""  When Kourtney walked away, Kim declared: ""She's the least exciting to look at, so she can be out. She doesn't do s**t.""  Style thief  Image: E!) E!)  During a 2019 episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kim accused Kourtney of stealing her style.  The Poosh founder was joined by sister Khloe Kardashian as she tried on outfits for her birthday party.  As Kourtney styled a sparkly pink minidress, Khloe suggested they call Kim for her opinion, but Kourtney said she didn't trust her sisters judgement.  While on the video call, Kim said: ""Well, if you don't care, why do you keep picking out all the same clothes?""  Image: E!) E!)  Kourtney hit back: ""I don't know what you're talking about. I've never dressed like you.""  Kim further lashed out at her sister for reaching out to Thierry Mugler, despite the SKIMS founder having a special relationship with the designer.  Kourtney later branded the argument ""ridiculous"".  ""Kim and I have completely different styles, so even if we wear the same designer, we wear it in a completely different way.  ""The store may send me clothes that are more Kim's style, and I send them back.""  Things get physical  Image: E!) E!)  Kim and Kourtney's most notorious fight came in 2020, when Kim accused Kourtney of not showing up enough for the family business.  Kim claimed their mother Kris was always ""crying and begging"" her and Khloe to show up to events because she knew the other family members had different priorities.  However, Kourtney took offence to the comments and insisted she does work hard.  ""You have this narrative in your mind,"" she slammed. ""I will literally f**k you up if you mention it again.""  Kourtney then angrily threw a bottle of water at Kim, prompting the mother-of-four to jump to her feet and start a physical fight.  Image: E!) E!)  Kourtney was left in tears after her sister punched her.  Khloe was forced to break the fight up, before Kim accused Kourtney of scratching her and proceeded to slap her sister.  Kim later spoke about the moment on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, saying: ""I don't ever normally resort to violence like that, but she scratched me so hard.  ""When I looked down at my arm and I saw she'd really scratched me and I felt it all on my back, I just went over and slapped her back. It's not my proudest moment.""

When adapting Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur’s hit 1928 play The Front Page into this film, Hawks had the inspired idea of turning its star reporter character Hildy Johnson into a woman. The result is an immortal mix of hard-boiled newsroom setting and remarriage comedy, and Rosalind Russell as Hildy is a standout among cinema’s powerful women. She is matched in force only by her conniving but charismatic editor and ex-husband, Walter Burns (Cary Grant). Burns dangles the chance for Hildy to scoop her fellow reporters with the story of an impending execution in order to keep her from hopping the train that’s supposed to take her to Albany and a new life as a housewife married to bland insurance man Bruce Baldwin (Ralph Bellamy).

The Poseidon Adventure  MOVIES!, 5:25pm  Catch a Classic!  One of the most-remembered, and best, of the epic, all-star disaster movies made during the 1970s, this 1972 film from producer Irwin Allen features one of the most “all-star” of those casts, with an ensemble comprised of five Oscar winners: Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Jack Albertson, Shelley Winters and Red Buttons. Unlike some of those other movies, The Poseidon Adventure works and is a lot of fun in spite of (or maybe because of?) its kind of silly premise: A New Year’s Eve party aboard a luxury ocean liner is literally turned upside down when a tsunami capsizes the ship. Led by a determined preacher (Hackman), a small group of survivors attempts to escape by making their way up to the bottom of the boat, hoping that it hasn’t been completely submerged. A popular blockbuster in its time, the film was nominated for eight Oscars (including Best Supporting Actress for Winters), and won for Best Original Song (“The Morning After” by Al Kasha and Joel Hirschhorn). The impressive visual effects by L.B. Abbott and A.D. Flowers were honored with a Special Achievement Award by the Academy. Fans of Hackman will want to stick around after this, as well, as MOVIES! will be airing two more, somewhat lesser-seen titles starring the legendary actor: the 1977 Stanley Kramer-directed thriller The Domino Principle, also starring Candice Bergen, Richard Widmark and Mickey Rooney; and the 1988 war film Bat*21, costarring Danny Glover.

The actress and her husband originally had an intimate lockdown ceremony at Castle Leslie in her home county of Monaghan in January 2021, with just six guests due to pandemic restrictions.  Today's top videos  But in 2022 they got to enjoy a much bigger bash with family friends, and actor James who, Charlene jokes, was the ‘star of the show’.  In an interview with the Irish Mail on Sunday, the star of RTÉ's crime drama Clean Sweep said: ‘We had to get Covid married, as I called it, because we couldn't see each other. He was filming in Atlanta and he couldn't come to me and I couldn't come to him - I wasn't allowed in.’  Charlene McKenna at her 'covid wedding'. Pic: Instagram  Charlene continued: ‘So we had to crack on and do the wedding. We did the four people thing and we got legally married because then I could go the States. It was a freezing winter, and it was really lovely and it was very quiet.  'And then in the summer we had our wedding in Castle Leslie; we had the pub at the gate so we had a hooley in there the next day as well. We're both one of six [children] and we didn't want [too many celebrities], so our immediate family is about 55 people, so it was 75 or something.  ‘But Jimmy [Nesbitt] was there. He was the star of the show - everyone loved him, and he's great. He's a good friend.'  Charlene has been a working actor for more than 20 years, but she has had to overcome many challenges during her career, including being 'a weird casting choice'.  James Nesbitt attends the Walpole British Luxury Awards 2019 at The Dorchester in 2019 in London. Pic: Getty Images  She ‘said: I’ve been told that a lot. I've never been really commercial. I've been told I'm too ugly, I'm too pretty, I'm too harsh. I guess I'm just me, and you just have to get philosophical.'  But with a series of high-profile roles under her belt, including as the mysterious IRA leader Captain Swing in Peaky Blinders, Charlene says she wouldn't have it any other way.  'I do like to be challenged; I am easily bored,' she admits. Aside from playing the lead role as Shelly in Clean Sweep, Charlene has also branched out into production work.  After receiving the script for the RTÉ drama, she wanted to broaden her repertoire, so McKenna approached the show's producers and asked to be given an executive producing role.  The producers certainly listened, and Charlene even had an input into the choice of Barry Ward, who plays her husband Jason Mohan in the series.

'I don't want to get cowed, and they [the cast] ended being the loveliest bunch of people, but you don't know that before you've gone in.'  Charlene now divides her time between her home in New York and Monaghan, where she said growing up with five brothers hardened her from a young age.  Charlene McKenna in Clean Sweep. Pic: RTE  'It was robust and tough,' she said of her childhood. 'And you got the corners knocked off you. I'm a weird mix of a tomboy and a princess; I've no problem getting down and dirty, doing the lads' stuff, the girls' stuff.'  This, she says, has enabled her to take criticism on the chin. 'I'm a worrier by nature -I'm super-sensitive. You just have to let it [criticism] go, and if people don't like you just hope they aren't mean about it.  'I just always hope it's good enough and that people like it. Your job is to entertain people and take them away for an hour.'  Clean Sweep continues on RTÉ One on Sunday at 9.30pm. All six episodes are available on the RTÉ Player.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZXZva2UuaWUvMjAyMy8wNS8yMi9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2NoYXJsZW5lLW1ja2VubmEtamFtZXMtbmVzYml0dC1zdGFyLXdlZGRpbmfSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-12-12","Not Discerned","{""Amritsar"", ""Punjab"", ""India""}","2023-05-22T04:29:01","STOP whatever you are doing and for a moment just imagine a kaleidoscope of colors and loud boisterous laughter among thumps of ‘dhol’ and the gorgeous aroma of food wafting through the doors… you got it right! It’s a Punjabi wedding scene!!!  The Sikh culture revolves around the belief that the sure-shot way to a full and peaceful life is through giving and receiving love because bonds like marriages are seen as a key to getting closer to the divine.  As it is always asserted, Sikhism’s central principle is equality and a wedding reflects just that: equal union and purpose for both man and woman.  A fiesta of celebration through songs, dance, prayer, togetherness, the opulent Sikh culture, and rich Punjabi traditions make the entire wedding process enchanting…like a fairytale.  Having talked about the spiritual and religious bit of Punjabi weddings, now let us dive headlong into the fun part of the celebrations; it starts with the ‘Roka’ and ‘Thaka’ ceremonies where the consent of parents and elders of the family is sought.  While all the pre-wedding rituals are taking place, there is a parallel search going on! ‘The ‘Auntyjis’ flaunting their ‘Canada returned’ son or daughter! Looking for a suitable match, exaggerating about their achievements, bragging about their ‘Kothis’, and so on!! In the midst of this hullabaloo, what comes to rescue is always “Punjabi Music”! The thumping beats of dhol and peppy lyrics have become souls of a wedding, be it a Punjabi one or one from any other culture or country.  So much so that no “shaadi” can be complete without a “kaala chashma” from the Bollywood movie ‘Baar Baar Dekho’ or a “Saturday Saturday” from ‘Humpty Sharma ki Dulhaniya’, Punjabi music has taken all our weddings by storm. Even across the border, Pakistani ‘nikkahs’ are incomplete without grooving to Punjabi songs.  Anyways, back at the wedding, the ‘Maiya’ and ‘Vatnaa’ takes place where the respective relatives of the bride and groom apply a mixture of turmeric, and mustard oil on their body to make their skin clean and glowing. Like others, these festivities take place amongst songs sung by women and dancing by relatives.  Again, it will not be an exaggeration to say that this tradition is being portrayed even in South Indian weddings! Even in Netflix series ‘Bridgerton’, the second season partakes a Haldi ceremony…Punjabi wedding traditions in British television series!!  Next is the ‘Warna’ ceremony when relatives wave money around the couple’s heads. This money is usually donated to charity or distributed among house help. What is fun to watch is the fact that Punjabis always have a never-ending supply of 10-Ruppee notes for ‘Nazar Utarana’. This goes on and on till the bride reaches her ‘Sasural’. The weddings progress with ‘Mehendi’ and ‘Kalire’ ceremonies. Talking about ‘mehendi’, any wedding, of any cultural background, cannot take place without this fuction and ‘kalire’ have become the Bollywood bride’s quintessential ornament!  As the groom gets dressed in splendid attire just like the bride and guests, the gravity of the celebration comes forth. It’s larger than life! The riot of colors; pinks, reds, yellows, purple, the bling of gold, not to forget the contagious spirit!! Thus, begins the never-ending journey, ‘Baraat’. Here all the dancers come alive. Cousins go berserk, uncles do ‘Nagin’ dance, aunties give ‘thumkas’, but the groom? The poor guy just sits on the ‘ghodi and smiles while giving ‘galis’ in his heart. Does nobody realize the hurry he is in!! Once the baraat reaches the wedding venue, the bride’s family welcomes the groom’s family with gifts and warm hugs. Wait! Do you think a Punjabi wedding can progress so far without lavish food and drinks? Not at all!  Food, spreads of it, is a central part of Punjabi life. All this while, as the celebrations are taking place, there are tables loaded with ‘chole bhature’, ‘tandoori chicken’, ‘naans’, ‘kulchas’, ‘gulab jamuns’, ‘phirnis’… phew… the list is endless. But there’s still a missing link. You know what I’m talking about! Right? Yes, ‘car-o-bar’ time! At all weddings, there are men who keep coming and going out of the events with big smiles plastered on their faces. A vital requisite of a Punjabi wedding is ‘daaru’ without which festivities are incomplete.  Getting back on track again, ‘Anand Karaj’ takes place next. After bowing down before the Guru Granth Sahib, the bride and groom start the Laavas (wedding vows) while circling around the Holy Book. Back to food as the ceremony concludes! The guests are served a vegetarian lunch at the Gurudwara. In the evening, a reception is planned by the Groom’s family to welcome the newly-wed couple. Finally, it’s ‘Vidai’ time and the bride says her final goodbyes as her parents and relatives bless her and set her off on a new journey!  All in all, just like their energy and zest for life, Punjabi weddings are king-size! They do not believe in mediocrity. Everything, from clothes to jewelry, from food to music, has to be exquisite and glorified. That is a Punjabi wedding. Beautiful. Fun. Pious. Over-the-top. And an integral part of Bollywood. It seems like Punjabi weddings have captured the Indian movies completely for no wedding in a Hindi movie can happen without a Punjabi silhouette; music, food, attire, traditions…there’s a bit of Punjab everywhere!!  To wrap up, it can be easily seen that these days Punjabi wedding traditions can be witnessed not just in Indian cultures and religions but globally. They have become infused in everybody…undivided by caste or creed.

"wedding","2021-05-15","Not Discerned","{""Bombay"", ""Maharashtra"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T07:08:21","The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture  Indian weddings are renowned for their grandeur and cultural significance, deeply rooted in traditions that have been passed down through generations. However, as society evolves and modernises, so does the institution of marriage and the roles played by families in Indian weddings. In recent years, a discernible shift has taken place, redefining the dynamics and responsibilities of families during this momentous celebration.  The International Day of Families, observed on May 15 each year, serves as a meaningful occasion to not only acknowledge the importance of families but also to examine their role in shaping cultural practices, such as weddings, within specific contexts. In Indian society, where weddings hold immense significance and where the wedding market is a $50 bn+ industry, it is crucial to explore the evolving dynamics of families within this realm. Let's take a deeper look to understand the changing dynamics and emerging trends:  Embracing Individual Choices:  Traditionally, Indian weddings were initiated, decided and planned by parents and elders, with limited inputs from the couple. However, in contemporary Indian society, there is a growing emphasis on individual choices and preferences. Couples are increasingly empowered to make decisions not only regarding choosing their partners but also around their wedding ceremonies, guest lists, their choice of wedding venues and vendors as well as every possible detail around their special day. Families are happily adapting to this paradigm shift by embracing the desires and aspirations of the couple, encouraging personal autonomy while providing guidance and support as we see an increasing focus on prioritising the couple's happiness in the celebration.  Collaborative Planning:  Gone are the days when wedding planning was solely the responsibility of the bride's family. Today, families on both sides actively participate in the planning process, creating a collaborative and inclusive environment. Parents and siblings of the bride and groom discuss ideas, share responsibilities, and work together to organise a memorable event. There is also an increasing trend of many events being shared between the families. This collective involvement fosters stronger bonds between families and promotes a sense of unity, as they collectively embark on the journey of celebrating love and commitment.  Changing financial realities have prompted a re-evaluation of spending areas  Indian weddings have long been known for their lavishness, with elaborate ceremonies, opulent decorations, and extravagant feasts. However, changing financial realities have prompted a re-evaluation of spending areas. So while on one side many families have been opting for intimate and budget-conscious celebrations we also do continue seeing higher-budget weddings the common thread in all is prioritising personal experiences. This shift has resulted in a more balanced and inclusive approach, where families come together to contribute their resources, equally distributing the financial burden, easing it for both sides, and ensuring a memorable wedding without compromising on quality. We have also observed that couples financing their own weddings is becoming quite common in India, especially amongst millennials. Our data survey revealed that almost 40 per cent of them have contributed in one way or the other in the new normal.  Redefining customs:  Owing to the cultural shifts, families are becoming more open to the ideas and preferences of all. This is also leading to a shift in societal norms and traditions. These days families are redefining customs as per the preferences and convenience of their loved ones. For instance, our September 2021 data survey reported a 76 per cent surge in the demand for non-saaya wedding dates. Even though this surge was primarily driven by the pandemic and cancellations, it has stayed snd it depicts the change in the mindset of the new generation. This shift is also evident in multiple other customs such as the division of gifting between groom and bride's family, acceptance of a woman priest, and letting go of traditions like Kanyadaan and Bidaai.  Blending Traditions with Modernity:  While families adapt to changing dynamics, they also strive to preserve their cultural heritage. The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture involves finding a delicate balance between honouring traditions and embracing modernity. Families are re-imagining rituals, incorporating new elements, and experimenting with innovative ideas while staying rooted in the essence of their cultural practices. This harmonious blend of tradition and modernity reflects the evolving Indian society, where families celebrate their customs while embracing the winds of change.  The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture reflects the larger shifts happening in society. With a focus on individual choices, collaborative planning, financial prudence, gender equality, and cultural evolution, families are redefining the way weddings are organised and celebrated. These changes not only foster stronger bonds between families but also empower individuals to embrace their uniqueness. As Indian weddings continue to evolve, the changing roles of families serve as a testament to the adaptability, inclusiveness, and resilience of Indian society while continuously reminding us of the fact that no celebration is complete till you have your family to celebrate it with.

Less than three hours in Paris and we were engaged, and his determination all made sense. John was so nervous; it was hard to decipher what exactly was going on until he got down on one knee and eventually was able to muster: “Will you marry me?”.  The weather in Paris was just perfect and the city was less crowded than usual, so we got to explore our little engagement bubble before returning to reality.

For their nuptials, which took place on May 6 this year in Cabo, Mexico, Simone Biles decided on an unexpected accessory for her teeth. The Olympic gymnast got diamond-studded grills for her teeth, and she shared this choice with her husband, the NFL safety Jonathan Owens. After watching a recent video that was posted on social media, the fans couldn’t get enough of the couple’s diamond grills.  Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens show off their diamond grills  ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad  The official wedding videographer of Biles and Owens, Tony Pombo and his production firm Iris Films, posted a clip from their after-wedding scenes on their official Instagram page. The video showed the couple wearing diamond-encrusted grills on their teeth, and proudly showing them off as they enjoyed the post-wedding festivities. The couple were seen posing and dancing together at the function.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tony Pombo (@irisfilmsatl)  From the looks of her wedding, it is clear that Simone Biles does not hold back from what she has set her mind to. And her 300k engagement ring and the customized necklace she got for her wedding functions are proof that the Olympic gold medallist loves bling. For her dental bling, she chose none other than Johnny Dang, the celebrity jeweler who specializes in custom-made pieces. The grills made the couple look uber cool, and a similar sentiment was expressed by Iris Films official page when the video was posted.  They wrote in the caption, “Causing cold fronts when they exhale.” One thing is to be said, wife Simone Biles and husband Jonathan Owens do everything in style. Even Biles’ engagement ring was a piece of art, fitting for an Olympian who is no stranger to gold and diamonds. The engagement ring was from Zo Frost and Co., and the diamond was handpicked by Owens himself. The oval-shaped diamond was then mounted on a pavé diamond band. Just like the engagement ring, the diamond grills caused a stir among the fans of the power couple.

In these resurfaced claims, it seems that Elizabeth had some comments about Meghan that made “everybody’s eyebrows hit the ceiling.”  Per Radar Online, Elizabeth was as blunt as can be in her final days, even allegedly insinuating her regret for Prince Harry and Meghan’s nuptials in 2018. Not only did she reportedly say she regretted “how things had panned out,” but insiders said Elizabeth claimed she “saw straight through” Meghan.  “It was a startling sentence to hear from the most forgiving woman on the Earth,” the source said.  Another instance occurred during a gathering at Balmoral Castle, where sources claim: “At the drinks before the dinner, a small group was talking to the monarch and she explained Harry meeting Meghan was a complete catastrophe. Everybody’s eyebrows hit the ceiling.”  While Meghan publicly praised Elizabeth when she and Harry were first engaged in 2017, but over the years, more information has come out about the strained relationship. Per NY Post, Meghan talked about the racism she faced from the monarchy, who were worried about how “dark” she and Harry’s baby would be. That coupled with many more reports showed that Meghan and Elizabeth’s relationship wasn’t a very good one.  Meghan wasn’t the only one of Harry’s partners that Elizabeth reportedly didn’t care for. In fact, she was allegedly one of the big influences in Harry ending things with his on-again, off-again girlfriend Chesy Davy.

After being together for over a decade, Pimblett finally popped the question on a trip to Thailand in 2020. Gregory has appeared frequently in Paddy Pimblett's YouTube videos, and the two are frequently seen partying and testing out food together.  Gregory shared several pictures on Instagram from her trip to Barcelona with her friends, in which they can be seen both partying at nightclubs and relaxing by the pool. Some of her friends posed for pictures while aboard a yacht while others wore Paddy Pimblett masks.  Despite enjoying herself, she said separation anxiety was setting in and she yearned to return to Pimblett. She captioned the posts:  ""Last of the Barca pics. The separation anxiety is kicking in hard. Had the best time with my girls love use so much. Can we go back now?""  Check out the posts below:  Meanwhile, Pimblett recently underwent ankle surgery after sustaining an injury during his unanimous decision victory over Jared Gordon at the UFC 282 in December last year. Pimblett has taken the UFC world by storm ever since he made his debut, amassing a perfect 4-0 record in the promotion.  Matt Frevola doubles down on his stance on why he should be fighting Paddy Pimblett next  Several fighters, including UFC lightweight Matt Frevolo, fancy their chances of beating rising star Paddy Pimblett. Frevola believes he is the best candidate to welcome Pimblett back inside the octagon whenever he's fit to return to action.  Frevola has challenged Pimblett on several occasions, but 'The Steamrolla' has momentum on his side after finishing his last three opponents in the first round, most recently Drew Dober at UFC 288. Pimblett, meanwhile, has seemingly accepted the challenge, citing it as an easy route to the top-15 of the division.  Shedding light on why the Paddy Pimblett vs. Matt Frevola matchup makes sense in an interview with MMA Junkie, the UFC lightweight stated:  “It’s a win-win for the UFC. He wins, he gets the respect of the people, and he’s still the star. I win, I’m the guy. I think it’s a win-win, it’s a no-brainer that that’s the next fight, and it just comes down to when he’s ready. He’s got his ankle surgery. I think you give him a couple of weeks to start training again, and then he’ll know when he’s ready. Hopefully it’s MSG in November.”  Check out the full interview below:  Poll : 0 votes","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9tbWEvbmV3cy1sYXVyYS1ncmVnb3J5LXdpZmUtcGFkZHktcGltYmxldHQtcHJlLXdlZGRpbmctYmxhc3QtYmFyY2Vsb25hLWJhY2hlbG9yZXR0ZS1wYXJ0edIBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9hbXAvbW1hL25ld3MtbGF1cmEtZ3JlZ29yeS13aWZlLXBhZGR5LXBpbWJsZXR0LXByZS13ZWRkaW5nLWJsYXN0LWJhcmNlbG9uYS1iYWNoZWxvcmV0dGUtcGFydHk?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In addition to her marriage, Nicola from Saggart, Co Dublin, also landed the opportunity to spend her wedding night in the company of country heart-throb Nathan Carter.  “It’s a wedding day and night I’ll never forget,” Nicola tells the Sunday World as she relives the amazing experience.  As a busy mother juggling the demands of three children— Aoife, Jack and Daniel — bubbly Nicola, who is also a big fan of Cliona Hagan, says she doesn’t get the chance to see the Irish country singers performing live.  In fact, until her wedding night, she had never been to a Nathan Carter concert, which made the experience all the more special.  Nicola and Kevin on their wedding day  “Kevin and myself got married in the registry office in Dublin on the day of Nathan’s concert with just our children and our parents at the ceremony,” Nicola reveals.  “When we picked the day we did a search to see what was on entertainment-wise. I just absolutely love country music and I couldn’t believe it when we discovered that Nathan was playing at the Bord Gais theatre.  “I emailed his management telling them it was our wedding day and would there be any chance of meeting Nathan at the show. It was a lovely surprise when his manager (John Farry) came back and said that Nathan would be delighted to meet us.”  The couple booked into the nearby Grand Canal Hotel for their wedding night and enjoyed a pre-concert dinner together in the hotel before the show.  Then the icing on the (wedding) cake was their backstage pass to get up close and personal with the Wagon Wheel superstar.  “Nathan was so lovely, down to earth and easy to chat to,” Nicola says. “I think he was amazed that we had just got married a few hours earlier and had chosen to be at his concert for our wedding night.  “We had a lovely chat and had some photos taken. Nathan was also playing at the Bord Gais the following night and he then gave us a little wedding gift of tickets to that show as well.  “So, from never having the chance to see him before, I got to watch him two nights in a row.  “I brought my mum and daughter to his concert the following night and they were just so excited as well. The memories I have from those two days and nights are just fabulous.  Nicola and Kevin on their wedding day  “Nathan is an amazing performer and he puts on such a great show. It really had everything, including a big choir.  People loved it all and it was such a brilliant atmosphere in the theatre.  “As wedding days go, it was certainly an unusual one.”  Nicola and Kevin, who, she says, “met randomly” despite both being from Saggart, have been together for seven years and now have a more elaborate wedding ceremony organised for next month in Lanzarote.  They will be joined by a party of more than 50 family and friends.  “I’m afraid Nathan isn’t our wedding band, but he’s more than welcome to come,” Nicola jokes.  Country kingpin Carter, who is hosting a weekend of shows at the Gleneagle INEC in Killarney, Co Kerry this weekend, says he felt honoured that Nicola and Kevin chose his recent Dublin concerts in the Bord Gais Energy Theatre as the entertainment on their wedding day.  “Obviously getting married is the biggest day of your life, so for a couple to make you a part of that special moment is a real honour,” Nathan says.  “Nicola and Kevin are a lovely couple and I enjoyed meeting them on their wedding day.  “They were so relaxed and just seemed to be taking it all in their stride.”  The last time Nathan played the Bord Gais Energy Theatre was in July 2016 — and he arrived at the show by helicopter after earlier performing at a wedding in the North for a thrilled husband and wife who won the prize in a competition.  “I had a ball playing two gigs in one day,” Nathan said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdW5kYXl3b3JsZC5jb20vc2hvd2Jpei9tdXNpYy9pcmlzaC1jb3VudHJ5LWZhbi1lbmpveXMtd2VkZGluZy1vZi1oZXItZHJlYW1zLWJhY2tzdGFnZS1hdC1uYXRoYW4tY2FydGVyLXNob3cvYTY0NTA4NzQ5My5odG1s0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On May 18, the fast-food restaurateur posted a video of herself twirling around in a beautiful off-the-shoulder wedding gown that featured pleats. The millionaire business guru donned a huge smile as she pranced across the fitting room in the gorgeous ensemble.  “Planning a wedding is ghetto and expensive. One more add on and we are going to the justice of the peace,” the mother of two jokingly confessed in the caption. “But I said YES to the dress.. Not this one but you get the point!“  “Y’all wanna come to the wedding?” she asked her followers.  Some fans of Cole jumped into the comments section hoping to score an invite to the star’s wedding ceremony.  “Invite me. Sit me at the business table and then the singles table,” one person wrote. “Capitalize on my experience. Let me get my dress ready.”  Another user chimed in, “Yes! I like vegan food, dancing, and I won’t be a hater and wear anything close to white unless it’s required! “  A few netizens sympathized with Cole about the headaches that can occur from wedding planning.  “Unless y’all got a network payin for it… go to the courthouse and have THEM pay for a TV wedding/reception sandz,” a third fan commented.  A fourth user quipped, “Girl it’s beyond ghetto!!!! I wanted to just go to the Justice of the peace but I said yes to the venue.”  Wedding planning does require alot of work, but we have a feeling that Cole’s ceremony will be well worth the headache.  In 2022, the Slutty Vegan CEO said “I do” to her fiance Hayes during Essence Fest.  As the couple was dropping business gems at the Essence Marketplace panel, the bustling businesswoman lit up with shock and excitement when Hayes popped the question smack dab in the middle of their conversation. The lovebirds were wearing matching outfits during the gushy proposal.  “You’ve had my back for a long time…I want to make it real,” Hayes told Cole as he got down on one knee. When the vegan lifestyle enthusiast was asked if she was going to “yes,” Cole tearfully replied, “Of course I do! Fuck yeah, I do!”  Relive the beautiful proposal down below. Congrats to Pinky Cole!

The June 1 wedding of the Crown Prince to Saudi architect Rajwa Al Saif is expected to be attended by senior figures from the Arab Middle East. It will offer rare a close-up of the Hashemite monarchy, whose members have ruled Jordan since it was established as a British protectorate in 1921.

It was followed by the main car, a Toyota Land Cruiser, surrounded by 14 open-top red army Land Rovers and seven red army motorcycles. Support vehicles drove at the rear of the convoy, including another Land Cruiser carrying communication equipment.  The army's red Land Rovers and motorcycles are only used on special occasions, such as when King Abdullah II goes to open the parliament's annual sessions.

"wedding","2023-05-21","Not Discerned","{""Khania"", ""Hania"", ""Greece""}","2023-05-22T05:14:21","A bride and groom in Chania arrived at their polling station to vote immediately after their wedding.  Babis and Anna married on Sunday, May 21 at the Holy Church of Agia Sophia. Immediately after the sacrament, they rushed to the ballot box to vote, according to Zarpa News.  See video and photos:  Greece’s ruling New Democracy party scored a crushing victory in parliamentary elections Sunday but fell short of winning an outright majority in a vote dominated by the cost-of-living crisis, a wiretapping scandal and anger over the country’s deadliest-ever train crash.  With more than 99% of votes counted, ruling center-right party of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, surpassed all expectations garnering more than 40% of the vote in a result he described as a “political earthquake.”  His main opposition, Alexis Tsipras’s centre-left Syriza party, suffered major losses, coming in second with just over 20% of the vote.  However, Mitsotakis did not win enough votes to secure a single-party government. The vote was held under a new proportional representation system that requires a threshold of around 45%.  Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou will now give the top three parties up to three days to form a coalition, though Mitsotakis has already indicated he’s not interested in sharing power.  “Without a doubt, the political earthquake that occurred today calls on us all to speed up the process for a definitive government solution so our country can have an experienced hand at its helm as soon as possible,” Mitsotakis told jubilant New Democracy supporters massed outside party headquarters in Athens.  If he fails to form a coalition, a caretaker government will be sworn in and a second vote will take place in late June or early July. That round will be held under different rules requiring the winning party to achieve just 37% of the votes.  Greece’s economic future on the ballot  Greeks headed to the polls with the future of the economy and their strained personal finances topping their priorities.  New Democracy’s bid for a second term focused on the country’s successful economic recovery since coming to power in 2019 with Mitsotakis portraying himself as a safe pair of hands to further boost growth.  “The numbers speak for themselves,” Mitsotakis told CNN while on the campaign trail. “We were laggards when it came to growth back in 2019 and now we are one of the best-performing economies in the eurozone.”  The country’s economy has staged a stunning turnaround in the last decade, and is now on the brink of returning to investment grade on the global market for the first time since it lost market access in 2010.  Significantly for the elections though, the country’s financial gains have not yet been felt by many Greeks struggling with high inflation and living costs.  A belt-tightening financial crisis throughout the 2010s saw the country’s GDP slashed by a quarter and people’s salaries and pensions severely cut leading thousands to the breadline.  Asking for a second chance is main opposition leader Alexis Tsipras, who came to power in 2015 promising radical change that saw bank runs and capital controls fall short of convincing voters.  “Greeks did not vote feeling optimistic,” says political analyst Petros Ioannides, managing partner of aboutpeople pollsters. “Neither of the two main parties are new to the scene. They have both been in government during the last 10 years,” he said.  “In 2015 people voted for change, and a newcomer prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, and there was hope in that. In 2019 there was a different kind of hope, a yearning for a return to stability, again with a first-time prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis.  “In these elections, the parties and leaders are known and so are their perceived shortcomings.”  Backdrop to election  The elections also took place in the shadow of a wiretapping scandal in which the government was accused of spying on opposition politicians and journalists, raising overall concerns over the rule of law.  The turmoil, which one political party referred to as “Greek Watergate,” forced a number of high-profile departures.  But potentially, the most severe blow for the government came in the form of a head-on train collision that killed 57 people in February, many of them university students.  The country’s deadliest railway disaster saw tens of thousands of people take to the streets across Greece, venting their anger against corruption and chronic lack of infrastructure. It also pushed some voters away from established parties.  Young protesters were seen on national television crying, saying they felt betrayed by their politicians. Out of a total of 9.8 million registered voters, there were around 440,000 first-time voters in this election, and many may have been influenced by the rail disaster.  What next?  Despite not gaining enough votes in the first round, New Democracy has indicated that it does not want to enter a coalition government.  The most likely scenario is that a caretaker government will be sworn in and a second vote will take place, most likely, in early July.  This vote will take place under a bonus system that benefits the winning party by giving it a bonus of up to 50 seats in parliament calculated on a sliding scale depending on the percentage of votes won.  Wolfgango Piccoli, co-president at financial advisory firm Teneo, said markets and investors are looking for strong leadership and political stability, and would prefer a single-party government.  “A coalition government would raise concern about political stability. That would certainly increase the risk from a market perspective that there will be bickering and not much will get done,” he added.  With many Greeks having already factored in a second ballot, analysts say some of Sunday’s voters chose to vote for smaller parties, to show their discontent with the political establishment.  They are expected to rally behind the main parties in a second election where they will want to see a strong government emerge.

"wedding","2023-05-20","14:00:00","{""EastHampton"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T05:00:00","Moby (handout)  Two decades ago, the world’s most famous electronic musician met a doctor who changed his life. Moby – named after literature’s most famous whale, which was created by his great-great-great uncle – met Oliver Sacks, who helped open the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function in 1995. “I’d been a musician since I was very young,” Moby says, “but until meeting Dr Sacks, I hadn’t thought that what I did was anything more than light-hearted entertainment.”  That the formerly wild music star had an epiphany after meeting the neurologist famous for writing The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, may seem like an odd clash of cultures. But Moby is a complex creature, a man whose past debauchery stands in contrast to his smart, meticulously calculated music. In conversation too, he’s intellectually precise; if it weren’t for the tattoos on his arms and neck, it’s easy to picture him in a lab coat.  Today, Moby sits on the board of the Institute, which has lent scientific gravitas to the idea that music can be palliative. He tells me he’s no longer interested in his career per se, but rather in creating songs “that have profundity, beauty, and an ability to transcend.”  Moby is giving this interview from his kitchen. It’s a neat, functional space: the architectural equivalent of the sleek sound he pioneered in the Nineties with hits including Porcelain, Go, and Natural Blues. The turn of the century marked his commercial and cultural zenith; he counted David Bowie among his best friends and his 1999 album Play sold 12 million copies worldwide – more than any other electronic record ever.  What happened next has been well documented: tales soaked in booze and fuelled by drugs and romantic misadventures pepper the pages of his own memoirs, the aptly titled Porcelain (2016) and Then It Fell Apart (2019).  Moby has also faced external criticism during his career. He’s been denounced by electronic purists for ‘selling out’ after he licenced all the tracks from Play for commercial use. He’s been ridiculed for the veganism he so proudly espouses: the slogan Animal Rights tattooed on his arms and Vegan For Life on his neck. And he’s been called a liar by Natalie Portman, who he claimed to have dated but whose own memory is that of a man loitering around her in a nightclub when she was only 18.  Story continues  Moby admits he’s often prone to solipsism; but when I ask him whether he feels some of the criticism has been unfair, he shrugs it off. “I’m aware of how badly both memoirs sold. Do I feel misunderstood? It doesn’t really matter.” He’s learnt to make concessions. You can’t be everyone’s cup of tea, so to him, there’s no use trying to control the narrative.  “I don’t read comments or reviews,” Moby goes on. “It’s destructive to let your sense of self be informed by the glib opinions of people you’ve never met – especially if they’re not real people. Why would I hand over my wellbeing to a bot army in Belarus?”  Moby’s ditched popularity for causes. This February, he released Punk Rock Vegan Movie, a dive into the Seventies-born movement and its role in inspiring animal rights activism. The film is available to watch for free YouTube: rather than making money from it, he’s more interested in spreading the message of veganism as widely as possible. Animal rights campaigning, he says, is his “ethical duty”.  “It’s excruciating,” he acknowledges. “I think every activist will agree that no one wants to be an activist.”  Unlike some, Moby puts his money where his mouth is. “I work with VC [venture capital] funds and invest in companies that offer alternatives to animal-based produce,” he says. As the founder of production company Little Walnut, he’s raised funds for films including Slay, about the fashion industry’s abuse of animals, and the 2021 documentary short Why I’m A Vegan. “I try to use whatever resources and platforms I have to somehow move the needle towards a more compassionate, more rational future,” he says.  In 1996, Moby released an album called Animal Rights to draw attention to the issue; but he’s never successfully written issue-oriented music. “I’d love to be as gifted as Neil Young or John Lennon,” he laughs. “You listen to What’s Going On by Marvin Gaye and think, what a remarkable use of music and lyrics.” His own attempts to write issue-focused songs always yielded something he felt was “dry, pedantic and didactic”.  Moby measures each of his words carefully; his crisp, clear enunciation feels quasi-academic. He loves an -ism, and name checks multiple philosophers as we explore the motivations behind his new projects. There’s history behind this: Moby majored in philosophy at university and once thought of making it his career. “I was gonna get my doctorate and teach philosophy in New England at a community college – and just make music in my basement that no one paid attention to,” he laughs.  Moby (handout)  In lockdown, he revisited many texts from his undergraduate days, looking for meaning at a time when life seemed to stand still.  There’s an existentialist flavour to Moby’s new album, which rethinks his past material into new, more grandiose compositions. Released earlier this month, Resound NYC transforms songs from across the Moby canon: tracks once known for their electronic appeal have been reimagined as rock numbers, sung by the likes of Lady Blackbird, Gregory Porter, Ricky Wilson, musical theatre powerhouse Marisha Wallace, and Nicole Scherzinger. Moby’s favourite collaboration, however, isn’t with a big name.  “One of the last tracks on the record is Run On, with Danielle Ponder,” he says. The original song, from the Play album, samples the hook from Run On for a Long Time, a 1949 recording by Bill Landford and The Landfordaires – which Ponder’s father, Elijah, sang while growing up in the deep south. Elijah is now 90 and has advanced Alzheimer’s; when Danielle visited him in hospital and told him she was singing Run On, he lit up and started singing the 1949 song.  “She held up her iPhone to him, made a voice note of him singing and sent it to me,” Moby says. “And it was so powerful that I threw away the production I had prepared and rewrote the entire song around his vocals.” Danielle came to the studio to record her part, and it became a duet. By chance Moby had stumbled onto something profound.  For him, it’s as much about the sound as it is about the story behind it. When It’s Cold I’d Like To Die – a song that’s been featured on both The Sopranos and Stranger Things, he says proudly – is another highlight, but one he says was laborious to produce. “It’s a weird song, in that there’s nowhere to hide.” He clarifies: “There’s no yelling, no vocal processing, no autotune, no background vocals – it relies on one singer being exposed and vulnerable.”  Moby worked with a numberof gifted vocalists to record this new version, but something always felt off. One day, someone on his team went to a wedding in Texas; he was impressed with the singer there, and asked Moby if he might consider him for the track. “I loved the idea of a wedding singer in Texas being the only one able to do justice to a song so poignant and delicate,” Moby laughs. The idea soon became reality.  Moby is a born raconteur. Beyond the faux intellectual posturing (which I don’t think he does on purpose) a man emerges who is in genuine pursuit of the profound. He’s no longer in the business of trying to be the cleverest or the most successful; he wishes, simply, to tell compelling stories, through music that is lasting and important.  He worries, he says, that his big claims on music and life might sound too self-aggrandising, but “what better use of a life is there than trying to create music that is profound and transcendent?” he asks. I’m still trying to think of a response.

The original rom-com followed Toula Portokalos’s struggles to find love and accept her identity.  12 My Big Fat Greek Wedding burst onto screens in 2002 and was a surprising box office hit Credit: Alamy  12 The trailer for the franchise's third film has recently been released  It was a massive success at the box office bringing in £296million from a budget of just £4m.  The cast has reunited for the third installment, set for release in September, which sees the family visits Greece after the death of Toula's dad Gus.  While it remains a fan favourite, away from the cameras there’s been barrel-loads of real-life drama that even the family’s favourite fix Windex couldn't solve.  From an arrest to marriage breakdowns and a casting row, we reveal what happened next to the My Big Fat Greek Wedding cast.  Antonia Vardalos  12 Antonia 'Nia' Vardalos overcame IVF struggles and wrote a bestselling book  Canadian actress Antonia 'Nia' Vardalos starred as unlucky-in-love Toula, who fell for non-Greek Ian Miller and finally found acceptance for who she was.  In the film, her family were desperate for her to marry and have children - and sadly, fertility was a struggle faced by the star while married to Ian Gomez, who plays Mike in the film.  The actress, now 60, spent nine years trying to conceive, going through 13 rounds of IVF and looking into surrogacy before finally adopting their daughter Ilaria.  She wrote about taking in the three-year-old, who was previously in foster care, in the book Instant Mom, which became a New York Times bestseller.  Antonia and Ian divorced in 2018 but appear to be on good terms with her ex describing the film as a “really sweet franchise” that helped “families get back together”.  Away from My Big Fat Greek Wedding, she’s starred in Cougar Town, Grey’s Anatomy, Helicopter Mom and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.  John Corbett  12 John Corbett is best known as Aiden in Sex And The City  Floppy-haired John Corbett played heartthrob Ian Miller but is better known as Aidan Shaw, Mr Big’s love rival, in Sex And The City.  Recently the actor, now 62, came under fire for incorrectly “confirming” he would appear in “quite a few episodes” of Sarah Jessica Parker's spin-off series And Just Like That.  The show’s furious writer Julie Rottenberg told Deadline: “John Corbett should be writing personal apology notes. We didn't say anything.”  Thankfully his personal life has had a little less drama. He's been in a relationship with the actress Bo Derek since 2002 and married her in 2020.  They were set up on a blind date by agent Norby Walters when John had no one to take to an Oscars party.  Recalling the matchmaking In 2005, he told Today: “I said, 'I'm not dating anyone,' and he said, 'I'll get you a date, Corbett!' And he set me up with Bo.""  John has starred in Portlandia, Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll alongside Lady Gaga and this year appears in How I Met Your Father - a spin-off of How I Met Your Mother.  Michael Constantine  12 My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 has been dedicated to Michael Constantine  Tributes poured in after the death of Michael Constantine, who played Toula’s proud father Gus.  He passed away from natural causes at the age of 94, in September 2021.  My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3 is dedicated to the actor, whose career spanned back to 1959 and notably he was awarded an Emmy for his role in Room 222.  Michael married and divorced twice, first to the actress Julianna McCarthy, who he met on the set of Inherit The Wind and had two children with, and then to Kathleen Christopher.  Lainie Kazan  12 Lainie Kazan had a brush with the law in 2017  Former model Lainie Kazan was already a big name before appearing in the film and previously posed nude for Playboy.  Since playing Maria in the rom-com, she's appeared in Desperate Housewives, Ugly Betty, Grey’s Anatomy, Modern Family and RuPaul’s Drag Race.  Lainie, now 83, has battled deep vein thrombosis since the Seventies and in 2016 was hospitalised after a car collision but made a swift recovery.  In 2017, Lainie was arrested for stealing £150 ($180) of groceries which reportedly included cleaning supplies, a hot rotisserie chicken, tomatoes, Jell-O and uncured pepperoni, in California.  She initially denied the allegations but later took a plea deal where she would participate in a Neighbourhood Justice Programme.  In 2021, Lainie revealed her early struggles in Hollywood to Page Six and claimed: “There wasn’t a man I met with that didn’t try to sleep with me”. She says she turned down their advances.  Gia Carides  12 Gia Carides and her husband split up in 2017  Gia Carides played cousin Nikki in My Big Fat Greek Wedding just four years after her role in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.  The actress, 58, was married to fellow actor Anthony LaPaglia for 15 years until 2017, and they share a 20-year-old daughter, Bridget. After their split, Gia hit out at sources who claimed their relationship ""failed"".  She told The Daily Telegraph: “People say it's failed. My attitude is that it didn't… 20 years is a long time for any relationship and so many positive and great things came out of it.”  They sold their £6.5m ($8.2m) mansion shortly after Anthony started dating Alexandra Henkel, an actress 31 years younger than him, in 2016.  Ian Gomez  12 Ian Gomez was married to the film's lead star  After playing Mike in the film, Ian Gomez had roles in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Lost, Cougar Town and Grey’s Anatomy.  The actor, now 58, and his then-wife and film co-star Nia presented The Great American Baking Show for two years together.  Similarly to the My Big Fat Greek Wedding character Ian, the star converted to Greek Orthodoxy so that he could marry Nia but the pair divorced in 2018.  Joey Fatone  12 Joey Fatone is best known for being a member of NSYNC  Joey Fatone was already a huge star before playing cousin Angelo in the film because he was a member of the boyband NSYNC.  After hits including Together Again and No Strings, he branched out into acting and bagged roles in Robot Chicken, Kim Possible and Hannah Montana.  In 2007, Joey placed second in Dancing With The Stars - America’s version of Strictly - and during a guest appearance 12 years later suffered a wardrobe malfunction.  He told USA Today: ""I literally ripped the pants from the front to the back and then I just sat in the judge's chair and said, 'Oh well, you didn’t notice it.'""  Joey has also appeared in The Masked Singer, Impractical Jokers and Family Feud.  In his personal life, the 46-year-old briefly date popstar Pink in the early noughties before reuniting with his school sweetheart Kelly Baldwin in 2002.  They married two years later and have two daughters, Kloey and Joely, both of whom share NSYNC member Lance Bass as a godfather.  In 2020, Joey confirmed he was ""100 per cent"" divorced from wife Kelly, in an interview with US Weekly.  He has been dating Brazilian Izabel Araujo for five years.  Andrea Martin  12 Andrea Martin has scores of acting credits behind her  Away from the film, Andrea Martin voiced animated characters in Anastasia, The Rugrats, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius, The Simpsons and SpongeBob SquarePants.  The star, 76, who has won two Emmys for her screenwriting, went down a storm as Aunt Voula in the My Big Fat Greek Wedding films.  She's also appeared in 30 Rock, Will And Grace, Modern Family, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and Black Christmas.  In her personal life, she shares two sons with screenwriter Bob Dolman, and in 2017, the American became a Canadian citizen after living there for 47 years.  Louis Mandylor  12 Before the film, Louis Mandylor was a professional boxer and footballer  Louis Mandylor played Nick in My Big Fat Greek Wedding but before acting was both a professional boxer and footballer in Australia.  Since then the actor, now 56, has also landed small parts including in the TV show Charmed and the film Sinners And Saints.  Stavroula Logothettis  12 Stavroula Logothettis has gone on to appear in other films  Stavroula Logothettis brought the part of Toula’s big sister Athena to life.  She married writer and activist Danylo Hawaleshka in 1996 and appeared in Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, Earthquake In New York and Harisma.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE3MjQwMy9teS1iaWctZmF0LWdyZWVrLXdlZGRpbmctZmlsbS1ub3cv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlLXN1bi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC84MTcyNDAzL215LWJpZy1mYXQtZ3JlZWstd2VkZGluZy1maWxtLW5vdy9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Best be careful when you tell someone that you love them to the moon and back because that might be true very soon. Space Perspective, a company based in Florida, is selling the experience of a lifetime: the chance to go to the edge of space. It won’t be as nerve-wracking as a full-on space flight, but it will bring you high enough that you can still boast you’ve been to space. But that’s not all. They’re also offering a couple the chance to have a once-in-a-lifetime wedding by tying the knot in space.  Get married in space with the help of Space Perspective  There’s a lot of talk about space tourism in the past years, and while the image that comes to mind for many of us is getting on a rocket and being launched out into space, Space Perspective is offering something a little different. They’re not promising to take you all the way into space but take you to the edge of space where you’ll be “above 99% of the Earth’s atmosphere”, according to their website.  Space Perspective doesn’t also use a rocket as some might assume. Instead, they use what they call a SpaceBalloon, which “launches” from land or sea, takes you all the way up, and then descends into the ocean for splashdown. The whole ascent and descent takes six hours, which means there’s plenty of time for a proper wedding and perhaps a short reception all while having a breathtaking view of Earth from above.  The capsule passengers will be in called the Space Lounge also comes with a number of amenities like drinks, comfortable chairs to watch the view, and wi-fi so you can literally FaceTime or livestream the wedding ceremony from the edge of space. One major limitation couples need to consider, however, is the number of people the Space Lounge can accommodate. With its original layout, nine people can be onboard including the pilot, though the website says the layout can be changed for events like weddings.  Of course, a wedding on the edge of space comes with a price. Space Perspective’s website says it costs USD $125,000 per seat, though we’re assuming the price will be higher if it’s a special wedding flight. If your interest is piqued, you can book now via their website.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXN0aWdlb25saW5lLmNvbS9oay9saWZlc3R5bGUvdHJhdmVsL3dlZGRpbmctaW4tc3BhY2Uv0gFIaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHJlc3RpZ2VvbmxpbmUuY29tL2hrL2xpZmVzdHlsZS90cmF2ZWwvd2VkZGluZy1pbi1zcGFjZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alfred Harrell had promised his fiancée the perfect wedding, according to a news release from the North Carolina Lottery.  “It’s been almost a year to the day and those promises will come true now,” he said in the news release.  Harrell was getting some gas when he pulled into a Circle K in Cary, North Carolina, and purchased a $5 Super Loteria winning ticket.  “I’m still trying to process it,” Harrell said. “If I went the other direction and didn’t get gas there, I wouldn’t have won.”  Now Harrell and his fiancée are looking for venues to accommodate what he hopes will be a “big family celebration.”  “May has definitely been good for us,” he said, noting he also met his fiancée two years ago in the same month. “I want to take care of her first.”  Harrell took home $106,876 of the $150,000 prize after taxes.  As for the lucky game he played, the Super Loteria debuted on May 2 with six $150,000 top prizes, the news release said. Five $150,000 prizes remain up for grabs.

According to European Union statistics, the number of couples seeking to get married has plunged to a nine-year low at the start of this year.  The country's inflation is currently 25.2 percent, the highest among EU countries. That has led to skyrocketing food prices and high energy costs – driving up the cost not just of day-to-day living, but also milestone events like weddings.  Julianna Börzsei and Balázs Gerlics plan to spend the rest of their lives together. They're counting down the days until their wedding at the end of May, but since their engagement, they've had to make some hard choices about their big day.  ""A wedding dress starts at $500 going up to $3,000 and beyond,"" says bride-to-be Börzsei. ""For an average Hungarian, it's too much. So I said to myself, if I can make the dress of my dreams on my own, I can save thousands.""  The couple says they're trying to trim as much as possible from their original wedding budget, but they're still 50 percent over.  ""We started to negotiate with ourselves on how to shrink everything to the original budget,"" says groom-to-be Gerlics.

The wedding, scheduled on May 28, became the talk of the town after the invitation card went viral. It mentioned the names of the bride and groom who met during their engineering course in a college in Roorkee. As the news spread, Mr. Rawat started receiving ‘warnings’ to call off the wedding.  During a public event organised in the State capital Dehradun by a religious leader, Swami Darshan Bharti, the public was asked to boycott Mr. Rawat because by marrying his daughter to a Muslim, he was supporting “love jihad”.  “He should be the first one to oppose ‘love Jihad’ and ‘land jihad’. But look, how shamelessly he is calling Muslims to come to ‘Devbhoomi’ (land of gods) and marry our daughters,” said Mr. Bharti and asked the attendees if Mr. Rawat should be taught a lesson. The audience raised hands in affirmation followed by more ‘hate speeches’.  A right-wing group from Haryana, whose members were on their way to Char Dham yatra and got to know about the wedding via social media, stopped at Pauri, especially to raise ‘objections’. They went to Nagar Palika’s office to threaten the chairman who fled seeing the group.  NGOs memorandum  Some NGOs also gave a memorandum to District Magistrate (Pauri) expressing concern over the wedding.  “Such inter-religious marriages will disturb the peace of the land of Uttarakhand. We request you to ensure that even if this wedding happens, Mr. Rawat should go outside the State to do the same,” the memorandum given by EK Prayas, the NGO, said.  After facing a weeklong protest, Mr. Rawat called off the wedding on Saturday. Speaking to The Hindu, he maintained that he could name many big leaders of his own party and Opposition who married off children into other communities and expressed shock at the kind of protest that he faced when he did the same.  “Due to people’s outrage, both in person and on social media, I have to cancel the wedding of my daughter,” Mr. Rawat said. He will be meeting the groom’s family in Amethi soon to decide the next course of action.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9ianAtbGVhZGVyLWluLXV0dGFyYWtoYW5kLWNhbmNlbHMtZGF1Z2h0ZXJzLXdlZGRpbmctd2l0aC1tdXNsaW0tbWFuLWFmdGVyLXByb3Rlc3RzL2FydGljbGU2Njg3Nzc0NC5lY2XSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her big day hasn't been far from her lips for months now after Gemma got Chesney Brown to agree to tie the knot.  The couple's romance has been a series of ups and downs, from the high of giving birth to quads on a cable car to the lows of struggling to make ends meet, one thing that has stayed strong is their love for each other and their big blended family.  And getting the wedding together hasn't been easy for the cash-strapped couple, however, and Gemma's twin brother Paul Foreman has been helping out despite his own money woes after making a promise to his sibling. But next week on the ITV soap, it's finally Gemma and Chesney's wedding day.  READ MORE: Join the FREE Manchester Evening News WhatsApp community  Everyone is determined to have the best day ever - in particular Paul who is keeping his devastating Motor Neurone Disease diagnosis a secret so his family can enjoy the big day. But as his condition worsens, questions are hanging over whether he'll be able to walk her down the aisle as promised.  There is, however, one thing that is for certain and that is that all eyes will be on Gemma as she walks down the aisle in what could be the most extravagant wedding dress Weatherfield has ever seen.  In first-look pictures, Gemma, played by Dolly-Rose Campbell, can be seen sporting the impressive two-metre wide dress, with a stunning seven-metre long train and complete with fairy lights, alongside her groom, whose suit has been bought by his son Joseph's grandmother, Linda.  The kebab shop worker, played by Sam Aston, looks dapper in the navy three-piece which has been worn over a crisp white shirt and is complete with a matching silk orange tie and pocket square. The loved-up couple are also seen alongside their children with Joseph wearing the same as his father.  (Image: ITV)  The quads, meanwhile, are simply adorable with Aled and Bryn sporting white shirts and navy trousers with orange dickie bows and matching braces while Carys and Llio continue the theme in white leotards with tutus to match their mum's dress and added multi-coloured. fairy wings.  But back to Gemma's dress and on screen, the mum-of-four has bought a charity shop dress which has been dyed and customised by her pal, seamstress Izzy Armstrong, played by Cherylee Houston. However, in reality, the huge jaw-dropping orange wedding gown has been co-designed and made by drag queen and fashion designer Liquorice Black.  Famous for their stunning unique creations for shows such as RuPaul’s Drag Race, Liquorice Black has teamed up with Coronation Street's head of costume Alex Hatzar to create the impressive gown which was crafted at Liquorice Black's studio in Manchester.  (Image: ITV)  The dress has 125 metres of tiny fairy lights on wire an the lights on the train are activated by a remote control. There are approximately 10,000 stones all individually glued on by hand and the dress took over 200 hours to make. In addition, the train is seven metres long, and Corrie revealed Dolly wanted it even longer, but joked she had to be reined in.  Speaking about the first time she put the dress on, Dolly told the Manchester Evening News and other press: ""I was just blown away by the dress. It's an absolute work of art. The detail that's gone into is just beyond anything I ever imagined and it was comfortable. Compared to a lot f Gemma's other costumes, because it was made to fit me from scratch, it was comfortable.""  Dolly said she was 'overjoyed' to get Liquorice Black, whose real name is John Roberts, involved with the dress and shared some of the inspiration and the process behind the final look. ""I based the idea off weddings I had seen as a child because these would have been the weddings Gemma would have seen as a child, growing up in the nineties.  (Image: ITV)  ""But then, added extra touches such as the fairy lights which were a little bit extra and that's quite Gemma."" And on the orange, she revealed: ""The colour was the idea of our costume designer Alex. She really wanted it to be orange because it's the most Chesney colour which we all found so funny. We agreed!""  And on how they got Liquorice Black involved, Dolly said: ""Myself and Alex in costume had lots of discussions about what Gemma would want as her dream dress and had put some ideas together. We decided on orange as a nod to Gemma and Chesney being ginger and also Gemma loves bright colours.  ""Liquorice and I have a mutual friend and I had seen an exhibition of their work and knew they had worked on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK so I knew that they would be the best person to make the dress, I was absolutely delighted when they said yes.""

They would then put it through some changes, re-release it, rebrand it, and then in late 2021, their brand-new, matt-coated, screen-printed Something Blue bottle, which took almost two years to design, hit the market and offered other couples in love the chance to enjoy Something Blue on their wedding day.

In a post shared on the r/weddingshaming sub-Reddit, the poster used Facebook to ask for some advice ahead of their nuptials next summer.  “I love my family dearly but sometimes they are flaky,” she began.  “I’m getting married in October of 2024 and when I send out invitations I want to put on the invitation that if they RSVP and don’t come I’m taking them to court for the cost of their portion of the food and services I paid for.”  Asking her fellow Facebook users if this was “tacky”, she clarified that “obviously there’s no cost to them if they RSVP and actually come”.  The query clearly sparked debate on the original Facebook post, with 300 comments remaining on the post.  On Reddit, the post was widely mocked, with one user joking: “I love that they don’t ask if this is legal, just if it’s tacky… you’d think that’d be the obvious answer!”  Another comment read: “RSVP: ‘On the advice of my lawyer, I will have to decline. Please see attached invoice for the lawyer’s consulting fees.’”  (Reddit)  “Step one on how to ensure there are zero guests attending your wedding,” one Reddit user wrote.  “How can you be so clueless that you don’t realise this is tacky? SMDH,” another person said.  Another comment echoed: “‘Is that tacky?’ The fact that you feel the need to ask this is… concerning.”  One Reddit user said: “Oh I hope they actually follow through with it AND sue people for it. I am sure the judge can use a good laugh.”  “This would be such a good way to give a large number of people a hilarious anecdote about a lunatic they knew that they can tell at dinner parties for decades to come,” another comment read.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vd29tYW4tYXNrcy10YWNreS1zdWUtZmFtaWx5LTAzMDkzNTUwNi5odG1s0gFJaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL3dvbWFuLWFza3MtdGFja3ktc3VlLWZhbWlseS0wMzA5MzU1MDYuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

I’m looking forward to it, despite the fact that I won’t know anyone there apart from his brother and the bride.  We get on but we’re not close, and only see them twice a year if that (we don’t live near to each other).  We have just had the day plans sent through, i.e. the time of the wedding and sit-down meal.  We won’t be eating until 6.30pm, so I said to my partner we needed to find ­somewhere to eat beforehand.  He then told me he’d been invited to brunch with his brother and a small group of friends on the morning of the wedding.  I asked him what I was supposed to do while he’s at brunch because the bride hasn’t invited me to a meal and I don’t want to sit by myself for a couple of hours or have breakfast in a foreign country by myself.  So, I told my partner I don’t want to go to the wedding now and that he’s being selfish for expecting me to sit around on my own.  Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to go now?  Coleen says  Um, yes, I think you are; you’re certainly being overdramatic and also cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Are you really going to miss out on a wedding and a fantastic trip abroad because you haven’t been invited to brunch with the lads?  At weddings, it’s often the case that you don’t know most people there other than the bride and groom.  Part of the fun of it is getting to know new people and working out how you’re all connected to the happy couple.  Of course, there are going to be moments in the day when your partner will be with his brother, so I think you have to put your big girl pants on and get on with it.  What’s so bad about spending a few hours on your own somewhere lovely? You could sunbathe, have a massage, read a book by the pool and enjoy the me-time and the peace before the party.  I think you’ve blown this out of proportion and you have to remember, it’s not about you or your partner, it’s about his brother and his bride. It’s their big day.  I imagine the bride probably isn’t doing brunch because she’ll be focused on getting ready with her bridesmaids.  Don’t not go to the wedding over something as small as this and try to have a good time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvaS1kb250LXdhbnQtZ28tYm95ZnJpZW5kcy0zMDAzNzM2NtIBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5ld3MvaS1kb250LXdhbnQtZ28tYm95ZnJpZW5kcy0zMDAzNzM2Ni5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

How to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New Jersey on Bravo Tuesdays 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo App.  The Real Housewives of New Jersey mom shed more light on her special day in a recent cover story for New Jersey Bride magazine. The piece, which was published on May 18, came more than nine months after Teresa and Louie tied the knot at the Park Château Estate & Gardens, a 15-acre palatial property located in East Brunswick. The mother-of-four told the outlet she enlisted event planner Jessica Rogers to help create a memorable experience — not only for her and Louie, but also for their 250-plus guests.  “I wanted everybody to walk in and be wowed, like, ‘Oh my God, this is spectacular,’” she said of the event. “And that’s what they did when they walked in. They were wowed.”  As shown on Instagram, the wedding decor was anchored by lush white floral arrangements with touches of gold and crystal accents. The lavish setting, designed by Preston Bailey, paired perfectly with the bride’s custom blush mermaid gown by Mark Zunino Atelier. The designer previously took to Instagram to share original sketches of the gorgeous dress, confirming it ""featured over 300 yards of hand-draped English netting."" Teresa complimented the gown with sheer beaded opera gloves and diamond accessories, including a bejeweled tiara that sat atop her extravagant hairdo, which reportedly weighed 3 pounds.  “I got used to it,” she said about her coiffure.  But perhaps more over-the-top than Teresa’s hairstyle was her selection of entertainment. According to New Jersey Bride, The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip alum treated guests to a 16-piece band, a DJ, and musical performances by saxophonist Art Crichlow and drummer Tito Puente Jr. Her team also hired a sword swallower, stilt walkers, aerialists, and burlesque dancers who “stripped down to nearly nothing.”  “I wanted the dancers to have as little clothes as possible,” Teresa said with a laugh. “Yes, I’m all about sexiness, I wanted that sexy vibe.”  Related  Teresa’s wedding guests included many familiar faces within the Bravo universe, such as RHONJ’s Jennifer Aydin, Dolores Catania, Margaret Josephs, and Jackie Goldschneider; The Real Housewives of New York City’s Dorinda Medley and Jill Zarin; The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s Kenya Moore, Phaedra Parks, and Cynthia Bailey; and The Real Housewives of Miami’s Alexia Nepola. Teresa’s brother and sister-in-law, Joe and Melissa Gorga, did not attend the event.  “It’s about you and the person you’re marrying. Make it about the two of you,” Teresa said when asked about the Gorgas' absence. “Don’t let any outside noise affect you. That’s what Louie and I did. We just focused on us. Especially when you have children, then you focus on your children — and your family and friends that are there for you. And just have the best time ever.”  Fans will get a closer look at the wedding on May 23, when Bravo airs the RHONJ special Teresa Gets Married.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyYXZvdHYuY29tL3RoZS1yZWFsLWhvdXNld2l2ZXMtb2YtbmV3LWplcnNleS9zdHlsZS1saXZpbmcvdGVyZXNhLWdpdWRpY2UtZGV0YWlscy1oZXItYW5kLWx1aXMtbG91aWUtcnVlbGFz0gF7aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnJhdm90di5jb20vdGhlLXJlYWwtaG91c2V3aXZlcy1vZi1uZXctamVyc2V5L3N0eWxlLWxpdmluZy90ZXJlc2EtZ2l1ZGljZS1kZXRhaWxzLWhlci1hbmQtbHVpcy1sb3VpZS1ydWVsYXM_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The wedding was reportedly for the brother of Aleksandr Vinokurov, who is married to Yekaterina, Lavrov's daughter.  But nationalist protesters staged a rally outside the resort, clashing briefly with police, who detained at least 16 people.  According to media reports, some protesters threw eggs at minibuses leaving the hotel, shouting: ""Russians have no place in Georgia!""  It was not immediately clear if the wedding party in fact occurred. Georgian President Salome Zurabishvili said it did not, and that wedding guests had already left the country.  An opposition TV channel on May 19 published video of what it said was a wedding ceremony at a marriage registry office in Tbilisi.  It was unclear if Lavrov attended either the ceremony or the reception.  Zurabishvili also said a Russian lawmaker had attended the events.  “I received a promise from the Minister of Internal Affairs that the family, the people who were going to celebrate the wedding today, left. The wedding will not take place. This is a victory for society, as well as the departure of [State Duma Deputy Sergei] Gavrilov from this country,” she said.  The incident came as Georgia moved to restore long-disrupted flights between Tbilisi and the Russian capital, Moscow. On May 19, a Russian passenger plane landed in Tbilisi -- the first since Russian President Vladimir Putin lifted a 2019 flight ban last week.  The jet’s arrival was met with protests at the Tbilisi airport and elsewhere.  The two countries have had no formal diplomatic ties since Russia routed Georgian forces in a brief war in 2008. The conflict ended with Tbilisi losing control over two breakaway regions: Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  Georgia has voted in favor of all international resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. It has also provided Ukraine with humanitarian aid and taken in thousands of war refugees.  However, the Georgian parliament, and many government positions, are dominated by the Georgian Dream political party, whose secretive billionaire backer made his fortune in Russian investments.

Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, had a blood alcohol level three times higher than the legal driving limit when she crashed into newlyweds Samantha Miller, 34, and Aric Hutchinson, 36, police said.  The couple were being driven to an Airbnb after their wedding reception on Folly Beach on April 28. The crash killed Samantha and badly injured Aric, in addition to the other passengers.  Komoroski has since been charged with three counts of felony DUI resulting in bodily injury or death and one count of reckless homicide. Although she was initially denied bond, her attorneys, Christopher Gramiccioni and Nathan Williams, have filed a motion asking for bond set at $100,000.  As part of that bond, the attorneys have suggested that Komoroski attend and complete an inpatient rehab program before going to stay at her mother's home in New Jersey, where there would be no access to alcohol or a vehicle.  Jamie Lee Komoroski (pictured) had a blood alcohol level three times higher than the legal driving limit when she crashed into newlyweds Samantha Miller, 34, and Aric Hutchinson, 36,  Miller died and Hutchinson was severely injured when their mangled buggy (pictured) rolled multiple times as it was thrown 100 yards by Komoroski's Toyota Camry  The attorneys also slammed the portrait of a 'villain' that they claim the media have concocted of their client.  'Certain media reports paint a picture of the accused as an unrepentant villain who ostensibly had a history of partying behavior, extrapolated from handpicked photographs posted to social accounts appearing to depict the accused attending a Halloween party or socializing with friends while in college,' read the motion.  'As this court is aware, such characterizations of the accused serve only to inflame public sentiment and remain irrelevant to the determination as to whether Ms. Komoroski poses a flight risk or any danger to the community,' it continued.  The motion also argued Komoroski has no criminal history and has a strong family unit, suggesting that she would pose no threat to the greater public, were she to be released.  Aric Hutchinson has separately filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Komoroski.  Attorneys for the grieving widower said: 'The tragedy has shattered the entire family, beyond just the individuals named in the lawsuit.'  In addition to Komoroski, the suit names several establishments that allegedly served the defendant alcohol before she got behind the wheel, despite her being 'noticeably and visibly intoxicated.'  In his case, filed on Wednesday in Charleston, Aric Hutchinson alleged that Komoroski 'bar hopped' before getting behind the wheel.  Hutchinson's lawyers argued the bars where she drank have 'a duty of care not to allow patrons to become intoxicated, to not serve alcohol to intoxicated persons.'  Danny Dalton, representing Hutchinson, said: 'The state grants restaurants and bars a license for the privilege to serve alcohol, and with that privilege comes a responsibility to the community to serve patrons responsibly and to deny service to individuals who are visibly intoxicated.'  They said they hope the lawsuit helps keep the community safer from drunk driving by focusing on the responsibility of liquor licenses.  'There are still many details we don't know about the sequence of events leading up to the tragic crash, but by filing a lawsuit, we can begin the legal discovery process that allows us to get the answers that Samantha's family deserves,' said Dalton.  The couple were being driven on a golf cart following their wedding reception on Folly Beach  Hutchinson filed a wrongful death suit against Komoroski, alleging that she had bar hopped all day before getting behind the wheel. He is seen here at a beachside memorial for his late bride  Attorneys argued Komoroski has no criminal history and has a strong family unit and would not pose a danger if released  Komoroski was allegedly going 65mph in a 25mph zone and her blood alcohol content was 0.261 - more than three times the driving limit.  She smashed into a golf cart taking the bride and groom and several others to their Airbnb.  The mangled buggy rolled multiple times as it was thrown 100 yards by Komoroski's Toyota Camry.  Samantha died of her catastrophic injuries, while Aric has been left in a wheelchair after suffering two broken legs, multiple facial fractures and a concussion.  The 34-year-old's devastated family revealed on Tuesday, two weeks after the tragedy, her heart-wrenching final words to her new husband.  Her sister Mandi Jenkins told The Today Show: 'She looked at him [Aric] on the golf cart and said 'I want this day to last forever.''  Komoroski had a blood alcohol content more than three times the legal driving limit  Miller and Hutchinson are pictured during their wedding ceremony in Folly Beach, South Carolina  Behind the wheel of a rented Toyota Camry, Komoroski was driving at 65mph in a 25mph zone, along a poorly-lit residential street when the fatal crash happened.  She reportedly told responding officers in the wake of the crash: 'All of a sudden something hit me. I did nothing wrong.'  Komoroski is said to have admitted having two drinks an hour before the collision - a beer and a tequila pineapple cocktail.  However, her blood alcohol content indicated she had closer to 10 drinks.  Sgt. Zac Halpern of Folly Beach police reported that he asked Komoroski how drunk she was on a scale of one to 10, and she mumbled that she was at an eight before demanding a lawyer.  Officers responding to the scene tried to administer a sobriety test, but she refused, yelling for her boyfriend.  Police noted that she appeared to try to hide her eyes from them.  Komoroski was the sole occupant of the vehicle and was charged with three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm or death and one count of reckless homicide.  Hutchinson has had two reconstruction surgeries and is set to have another, as well as suffering numerous broken bones and a brain injury  Komoroski, a logistics account executive, remains in custody at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center and is set to appear in court in connection with the incident in June.  She could face up to 25 years in prison for the death of the bride, as well as a fine of up to $25,100, and an additional 15 years and $10,100 for the serious injury caused to the men in the buggy.  For the reckless homicide, she could be handed a sentence of 10 years in prison, and a fine of up to $5,000 – as well as having her license revoked for five years on her release.  A GoFundMe page for the burial and medical costs has now reached over $728,000.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyMTA4ODk5L0xhd3llcnMtU0MtZHJpdmVyLWFjY3VzZWQta2lsbGluZy1icmlkZS13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LXNheXMtbm8tdGhyZWF0LXB1YmxpYy5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTIxMDg4OTkvYW1wL0xhd3llcnMtU0MtZHJpdmVyLWFjY3VzZWQta2lsbGluZy1icmlkZS13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LXNheXMtbm8tdGhyZWF0LXB1YmxpYy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The classic Sin City celebration took place in a chapel space complete with pews and a red carpet down the aisle scattered with rose petals. There was even an Elvis impersonator on hand, Stause revealed in an Instagram video.  For the ceremony, Stause wore a floor-length, pearlescent white gown by Gemeli Power and heeled sandals, and carried a bouquet of white roses.

"wedding","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Munich"", ""Bavaria"", ""Germany""}","2023-05-21T17:37:22","Raise a stein and say “Glückwunsch!” There was a royal wedding in Germany this weekend.  Prince Ludwig of Bavaria, the 40-year-old great-great-grandson of the last Bavarian King, Ludwig III, wed Singapore-born Dutch-Canadian 32-year-old Sophie-Alexandra Evekink at the Theatine Church of St. Cjetan in Munich on Saturday. The event, which included a ride in a rare 1950s BMW prototype automobile, Bavarian flags, and a reception at Nymphenburg Palace, was called “the biggest German royal event of the year” by the newspaper Bild. The new couple acquired a new nickname, as well: “the German Kate and William.”  The reception at Nymphenburg was thrown by the Prince’s cousin, the 89-year-old Duke of Bavaria (full name Franz Bonaventura Adalbert Maria Herzog von Bayern), head of the House of Wittelsbach.  Prince Ludwig is the son of 72-year-old Prince Luitpold of Bavaria, whose business holdings include the König Ludwig Schlossbrauerei, a brewery with roots dating back to the Bavarian Purity Law of 1516 and earlier. The company’s facilities include the 13th-century castle Schloss Kaltenberg, which offers a Knights’ Dinner for tourists, and a factory in a town called Fürstenfeldbruck. No, I’m not making any of this up.  The Prince studied law, focusing on human rights, at Göttingen University, and has spent a great deal of time in Kenya working with nonprofit organizations. He is the third child of Luitpold and wife Katrin Beatrix Wiegand, but the oldest male and, therefore future head of the royal house of Bavaria.  Sophie-Alexandra is a graduate of University College London and the University of Oxford, and has worked for the United Nations in Geneva and New York City. She is currently pursuing a doctorate in criminology at Oxford, and teaches there as well. According to People, her Reem Acra gown was tailored locally in Bavaria and included a veil designed by Ukrainian brand WONA. DW News added that the veil’s filigree “incorporated hidden Canadian and Dutch details.”  The new couple’s wider family, the House of Wittelsbach, goes back to the 11th century, and included two Holy Roman Emperors. Its branches are spread throughout Europe, and are connected, via Sofia of Hanover (who died in 1714), to the House of Windsor and the current British monarchy. Fans of the BBC comedy Blackadder may recall that Hugh Laurie played Prince Ludwig in the second season.  Bavaria, in the south-east of Germany, became a republic in 1918, and finally an official state within what was then West Germany in 1949. The House of Wittelsbach stood in opposition to the Nazi Party, and several members, including the aforementioned Duke, were held in concentration camps during the war.  News outlets like Britain’s Daily Mail have images from the event that include cute kids in light blue pants and flowers in their hair. Looks like everyone had a really nice day.

"wedding","1885-07-10","Not Discerned","{""Canton"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-22T04:04:28","EDITOR’S NOTE: This is part of a weekly series on our region’s history coordinated by the Trumbull County Historical Society.  As spring turns into summer, it’s likely that you or someone you know has at least one wedding to attend soon.  Peak wedding season soon will be upon us, and even as trends change, the word “wedding” conjures specific images in most people’s minds: Churches decorated with flowers, men in suits, a bride dressed in white with a veil and bouquet.  Not everyone has the same idea of what a wedding looks like, with a wide variety of traditions from cultures all over the world changing throughout history. Queen Victoria was something of a trendsetter in her time, and her influence on weddings still can be seen in weddings today.  While she may not have been the first, Victoria popularized white as the color of wedding gowns. She wore white for her wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, although it did take multiple decades for white to become the expected, traditional choice.  People tend to follow the examples set by the royals, even if they are an ocean away. Before Victoria set the precedent for brides all dressed in white, most brides wore their nicest dress for their weddings, which could come in a variety of colors. Even royal brides would wear dresses in colors other than white. White is an impractical color because it shows any and all dirt and stains. While it can be cleaned, white fabric is more likely to stain and lose its original clean, bright look, becoming more dingy over time and use.  Since the wedding dress was usually the bride’s nicest dress, it also was expected that it would be worn for occasions beyond the wedding. It would be expensive and impractical to buy a dress to be worn for only one day, and most people couldn’t afford that luxury.  Before the mass production of clothing, individual pieces of clothing were more expensive because they were made by an individual or a small group of craftspeople. Each piece was made custom to fit the individual rather than items being sold in standardized sizes off the rack like we’re used to today.  We have two examples of colorful wedding dresses in the Sutliff Museum’s collection. The first is a brown taffeta dress, possibly worn in 1883. The gown features metallic buttons with flower detailing, plenty of pleating and a bustle skirt.  The second is even more ornate, made of satin and velvet in rich shades of purple. It has a bustle and a short train as well as a matching hat and pair of shoes. The dress also has trim detailing, bows and a lot of pleating. We don’t know exactly when this gown was worn, but we date it to around 1898.  Both dresses are made of fine materials, and both have retained their rich colors.  In contrast to those dresses, Lydia Sutliff Brainard wore a white dress for her 1885 wedding to Edward J. Brainard. Her twill, satin brocade and lace gown also is extravagant, with ruffles, floral detailing, a bustle, a train, a bow, pearl buttons and a matching fan.  All three wedding dresses in the Sutliff’s collection date to the last 20 years of the 19th century, but the third illustrates the influence Queen Victoria’s choices for her wedding would have on weddings in the decades to come.  The Sutliff Museum is open weekly 1 to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Friday or by appointment.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyaWJ0b2RheS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvb3VyLWhlcml0YWdlLW11c2V1bS1kaXNwbGF5LW9mZmVycy1nbGltcHNlLW9mLXdlZGRpbmdzLXBhc3Qv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sign up for the Hot Topics newsletter for hot style and sex tips  Two women who made a name for themselves as Hugh Hefner’s favourite Playboy Bunnies have been feuding for years.  Since the Playboy Mansion closed its doors a number of years ago, we have learnt that life inside wasn’t as glamorous as we were made to think it was.  Former Playmates have shared tales of carpets encrusted with dog excrement, unhygienic-sounding group-pleasure sessions and shady methods of payment.  READ MORE: 'You don't need to be pretty to be a sex worker – you have to be smart'  While Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson were regularly photographed together and seemed to get along, they’re no longer talking.  Holly began dating Hugh in 2001 after she attended one of the weekly pool parties at the mansion and Kendra started dating the magazine publisher after she worked his 78th birthday party in 2004.  When E! cameras were allowed inside the wrought iron gates to film the series for The Girls Next Door, the group – which also included Bridget Marquardt – became recognised as more than just Hugh's girlfriends.  (Image: WireImage)  Holly, Kendra and Bridget were the stars of the reality series, which premiered in August 2005 and ran for five seasons.  But while they seemed to get along during and after the filming of Girls Next Door, their relationship quickly fell apart.  Even though Holly and Bridget were Kendra’s bridesmaids when she walked down the aisle in 2009, during a 2012 interview with CNN, Kendra said she was “never even really friends” with the pair.  And this isn’t the only time she’s spoken out about her relationship with the former Playmates.  “At the end of the day, it’s a very awkward situation ’cause it’s not like we’re The Spice Girls,” Kendra said on Fox 5’s Good Day New York in 2015.  (Image: Getty Images for Leather & Laces) (Image: Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)  “We dated an 80-year-old man at the same time. It’s very awkward. [Holly] probably wants to distance herself from that situation. God bless her, she should. It’s embarrassing because I saw some things that she probably doesn’t want me to talk about.”  In the same year, Holly alleged in her 2015 memoir Down the Rabbit Hole that despite appearances, she and Kendra’s relationship was rocky from the start.  ""Hungry from her own 'team,' Kendra desperately tried to make each new Playmate who arrived at the Mansion her friend — and her friend alone,” she wrote.  “At 19 years old, Kendra was stuck with a 9PM curfew, a 78-year-old boyfriend, and a stricter set of rules than she had ever had at home.  “And now, adding insult to injury, she was finally realising that she wasn’t as special as Hef made her believe. She was just another blonde girlfriend – and life at the Mansion wasn’t all she imagined it to be.”  (Image: Getty Images North America)  The drama didn't end there – as it seemed Holly felt betrayed after hearing Kendra thought they weren’t friends.  She addressed it in her memoir, revealing that she ended up texting Kendra to address how she really felt, calling her a ""coward"" and ""the fakest person [she'd] ever met"".  Holly concluded: “After that, I deleted her number from my phone. Kendra and I haven't spoken since, and I have to say, I don't miss her.""  In an interview with Us Weekly at the time, Kendra slammed the book, saying “It’s a shame that someone can’t be appreciative of what something like that has given them.”  Over the years Holly and Kendra have continued to have a back-and-forth over how they feel about their time in the Mansion and what they think of each other.  (Image: FilmMagic)  The last time either of them addressed their fallout was in 2022 when Holly appeared on the Juicy Scoop podcast.  She said that originally, she “loved Kendra"" and felt like the pair had a sibling rivalry while in the Mansion.  But when Kendra was filming her reality show Kendra on Top in 2015, things apparently shifted.  “Things got weird with me and Kendra and I felt like [the producer] was encouraging that, like, he wanted us fighting, he wanted the drama,"" she said.  “He wanted me to come on her show and, like, brag about how much money I was making in Vegas, so she'd get a little poke in the a** to take more jobs to make her show more interesting.""

People reports that “the royal family has not reached out to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex since the incident occurred on Tuesday night.” (Adding fuel to this fire, the couple’s fifth wedding anniversary was yesterday, so there apparently has been no acknowledgement of that, either.) The Telegraph reports that Harry and Meghan are “frustrated” by “the lack of personal contact” from his family, with the outlet reporting “The lack of personal contact, as well as Buckingham Palace’s refusal to publicly acknowledge or comment on the incident, is understood to have frustrated the couple, who friends suggested may have hoped to garner more support, particularly on a personal level.”  (Image credit: Getty)  (Image credit: Getty)  The incident occurred after Meghan was honored at the Ms. Foundation’s Women of Vision Awards in Manhattan Tuesday night; she brought Harry and mother Doria Ragland along as special guests. The chase, according to a Sussex spokesperson, lasted two hours and, according to a source speaking to People, left the couple “shaken”: “It was a disturbing situation, and they were shaken, but they are glad everyone’s okay,” the source says.

Chelsea Lazkani started the age gap conversation by asking the model her age. Marie-Lou said 24 and then corrected it to 25 as it was her birthday. Chelsea further pulled Jason's leg by asking his age. In response, he said he is 45.  Once the couple left, the ladies made fun of their age gap. Throughout the season, the fun banters about their age were featured. In episode 7, Jason confessed to Chrishell that he was serious about his new girlfriend.  The ex-couple went out for dinner, when Chrishell spoke about G-Flip —now married, the two were dating at the time. Chrishell stated that she and G were ready to adopt a baby and Jason could babysit from time to time. In response, he quipped that he and Lou would do it together.  Chrishell Stause replied:  “Lou? She’s not gonna be around by the time I adopt someone.”  Looking at Jason’s expression, Chrishell was surprised to learn that he was serious about Lou.

"wedding","2023-04-21","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T07:30:00","Ideas and people “just turn up” in our lives when we need them, Evelyn Woodard believes.  Evelyn is one half of the husband-and-wife photography team of Keith and Evelyn Woodard.  First Light Carrantuohill, from The Woodard Collection.  We’re looking out windows as we speak, in Co Kerry, at mountains that the pair have immortalised on walls globally, thanks to interior designers snapping up The Woodard Collection for homes and corporate spaces alike.  Because in the past month, Evelyn and Keith have channelled their two decades together as high-profile wedding snappers into a whole new energy flow as in-demand interiors artists.  “I’ve always been passionate about interiors — at one point we had nine couches in the house,” says Evelyn.  “But as photographers, both Keith and I have a good eye naturally, and know what works.”  Keith and Evelyn Woodard.  ENTRY SPACE  Back to the notion of “just turning up”.  The scene for Evelyn and Keith’s life — and ultimately work — partnership, was set in 1996.  That was when the pair first spotted one another in Evelyn’s local post office, in Faha, just outside Killarney, Co Kerry.  Then, he was a 35-year-old father of three, newly separated from his wife.  Evelyn was 22 and both were immediately smitten, but initially thought the other was married.  “Keith had moved into the area and had been living here with his three kids when I met him,” says Evelyn. “He was so tanned I thought he might be Italian — until he opened his mouth to speak! I was so disappointed to discover he was only from the UK,” she jokes.  The Dingle Train from The Woodard Collection.  Prior to becoming a photographer, London-born Keith had played tournaments throughout Europe as a professional golfer, with the likes of Nick Faldo.  Keith had come to Ireland on a golfing holiday in 1984. He married an Irish woman and was manager of Ballybunion Golf Club.  It was his golfing career that led to Keith’s photography career, which developed into a successful wedding photography business. “Keith literally started out by taking photographs of golf courses,” says Evelyn.  MARRIAGE SPACES  Evelyn — who formerly worked in business and corporate travel — and Keith themselves exchanged vows in Baltimore, Co Cork, in 2003. They have a son, Marc, 21, and Keith’s sons and daughters — Nick, Jason, and Siran — from his previous marriage.  One day, Keith asked Evelyn to help him out at a wedding. “That’s how I got into photography,” she says.  Evelyn Woodard.  The bride and groom chose many of Evelyn’s shots, and the rest is history. High-profile nuptials they covered together over the years included the wedding of Michael Flatley and Niamh O’Brien.  Keith Woodard.  OUTDOOR SPACES  Evelyn is quick to point out that Keith has helped her hone her photography skills. “I had never considered myself artistic at all, but even when Keith would photograph golf courses, I would walk the golf courses with him,” she says.  The Woodard Collection demonstrates how the couple’s work together is “evolving”, she adds. “The collection shows how we approach work from different angles,” says Evelyn.  Travel is another passion they share. “We love Italy, France, and Lanzarote — they’re our favourite countries,” says Evelyn. “Keith’s daughter Siran has lived in Lanzarote for the past 10 years, and we were recently there for her wedding — but we just consider all of the west coast of Ireland as the most beautiful place in the world.”  The Way She Moves from The Woodard Collection.  INDOOR SPACES  The Woodard Collection includes not only a gallery of their photography of landscapes and seascapes, but also offers a bespoke service including room mock-ups to clients worldwide. “I definitely like to visualise what something will look like when I’m designing a space and I think a lot of people — particularly women — are the same,” says Evelyn.  HEALING SPACES  Photography is also healing, both as a pursuit and as an element of our spaces, I suggest. “There’s nothing like it,” agrees Evelyn. “Especially with our abstract works. We want to evoke a feeling of taking someone back to a time or place. If you’re stuck in an office, it’s wonderful to have something that transports you.”  A particularly healing image for Evelyn is the sea.  A piece from collection in a modern dining room.  Evelyn was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2015. Following treatment, she recovered “eight years ago now, and all is good”, she says. “The sea is so healing and such a healing symbol, I find. When I was sick, I felt there was nothing in the world like it — to be outside, near the water.”  The photographer is a fan of “slow living” principles: “It’s a worldwide movement but I feel since the pandemic we’re paying more attention to it in Ireland. We need to take stock. We can’t just say ‘yes’ to everything. Things just turn up. Things figure themselves out. Priorities change.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL3Byb3BlcnR5L2hvbWVhbmRnYXJkZW5zL2FyaWQtNDExNDMwNjAuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

If you are a recent graduate, parent of a graduate, or grandparent of a graduate, congratulations!  It is a wonderful and important milestone that calls for celebration. When I worked in the Registrar’s Office, graduation was our “party.” We were quite involved in the ceremonies and details. One sure signal that it was time for graduation was the blooms on the Magnolia trees and all the U-Haul trucks and trailers around town.  Email newsletter signup  The set-up in the Grove is always impressive and I recall wiping the chair seats as leaf blowers were also employed in the effort to dry and clean the seats for the morning ceremony.  Parents, before you put away the checkbook thinking that you are done and have paid the last tuition payment, may I share some reasons why you won’t be able to put away that checkbook or credit card.  First, there could be the possibility of said graduate needing to put down a deposit on an  apartment or perhaps a down payment on a house near their new place of employment. No more fraternity or sorority houses. That’s where your checkbook can once again be useful.  And just when you think your offspring has settled into a nice residence, a new job, and is  adulting, along comes “the one.” The spouse who now makes your graduate a couple and they want a wedding. And that wedding could really eat away at your checkbook’s balance.  After the wedding, you find yourself acknowledging that you have indeed acquired another child that you love as your own. One you appreciate what he/she brings to the relationship and supports and cares for your offspring. Wonderful! Your family has expanded to include another family, one that you must now share your offspring with.  From there, if you are lucky, you may welcome a grandchild. And let me tell you, you are freer with that checkbook/credit card than you have ever been. What fun to spoil this little one who completes the family circle and has captured your heart forever.  If you are the graduate, after the celebration of graduation is over, you begin your journey into adulthood. You are now employed hopefully in a job that you find rewarding. You have a nice residence, with a nod to your parents’ willingness to assist you.  You have now accepted that for your career to progress, you must put your shoulder into the effort. You are indeed now an adult. Along comes that person that completes you and you marry. Again, your parents rose to the occasion to make the wedding memorable. And before long, your family expands to include a son or daughter. You are happy and life is good.  So, I have explained to you the cycle of life after this ceremony called “graduation.” It is indeed an end to the educational process, the more carefree side of your offspring’s life.  And it is the beginning of the life cycle. It is only after this milestone, that you will look back and define your timeline.  I also remind you all, the parent and the offspring, to savor each and every moment. Celebrate every occasion big and small — birthdays, holidays, family gatherings.  And remember that graduation was a defining moment. The celebration that set you all on this path.  Congratulations!

I am a 50-year-old woman, and I work in the arts. She works in a corporate job, wears a conservative hairstyle and has let her hair go gray.  I have the freedom to do what I want and look how I want, so I decided to have some fun with my hair. I didn’t appreciate her criticism.  I don’t want to come off as overly sensitive, but I do want her to know that I feel perfectly comfortable and happy with my playful hair. I don’t judge her for how she wears hers.

To Each Her Own  DEAR TO EACH HER OWN: Don’t go out of your way to admonish your friend.  Enjoy your new look. If she ever mentions it again, you can tell her that it hurts your feelings a bit when she is critical of your hair color.  You can remind her that you work in a field that allows you freedom of expression, and you chose to exercise that freedom. She has the right to her opinion, and you have the right to do what you want.  Point out that you have never made disparaging comments about her hair, and you would appreciate her extending you the same courtesy.  DEAR HARRIETTE: I’m going to the wedding of the daughter of a woman I grew up with. I haven’t seen them for years because I moved away when I went to college.  I don’t know why, but I’m feeling like this is almost like a class reunion when people stand around and look each other up and down and judge them on how the years have treated them.  Am I being harsh? Yes. But I have gained at least 50 pounds since I saw them last. I know how to dress myself and all, but I know they will be shocked when they see me. Heck, I’m shocked when I look in the mirror!  How can I prepare myself for what they will do or say? I am feeling extremely uncomfortable about facing people. I’m thinking I should just send a gift and skip the wedding.  Uncomfortable in My Skin  DEAR UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY SKIN: Guess what? Just like at a class reunion, you will most assuredly not be the only one who has gained weight since the last time you got together.  By all means, go to the wedding. Dress your best and check your attitude.  You are attending the most joyous occasion for your friend’s daughter. Focus on that. All eyes will be on the bride. When someone’s gaze lands on you, smile and talk to them.  Don’t say anything about your body. Ask them about their lives. Tell them about yours. Enjoy yourself. You can compliment people on things you like about their presentation or their stories.  If someone skittishly talks about how they look now, admit that you were a little uncomfortable, too, but you are so glad you showed up.

"wedding","2023-05-22","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T04:56:44","Previously, in Bora! Deborah, Deborah and Su Hyeok’s relationship took a step further as they went from hating each other to realizing that they had been each other’s support system since they met. Moreover, both of them received a wedding invitation from Su Hyeok’s ex-girlfriend, Yu Ri. Su Hyeok was out of sorts after he received the invitation, so Deborah couldn’t tell him that he didn’t need to feel so hurt because Yu Ri was two-timing him. A few days before her wedding, Yu Ri called Su Hyeok because she missed him. Deborah knew she had to stop him because she couldn’t see Su Hyeok being any more miserable than he already was.  Spoilers Ahead  Will Su Hyeok Keep His Promise To Deborah?  Deborah had to attend a friend’s engagement, and Su Hyeok had agreed to tag along with her to make things less uncomfortable for others as Ju Wan was going to attend as well, and also to make Ju Wan jealous. However, as they are on their way to the engagement ceremony, Su Hyeok tries to bail on her to meet Yu Ri. Deborah lets him go at first but later stops him because she is worried that he might get hurt more. She doesn’t tell him the real reason, but she urges him to keep his promise to go to the ceremony. They get into a fight over it, but Su Hyeok won’t back down. He decides to go and meet Yu Ri but also promises Deborah that he will attend the engagement ceremony as well. Deborah goes to the ceremony as she had already promised her friend, and she gets ridiculed over her breakup with Ju Wan, as she expected. Meanwhile, Su Hyeok meets Yu Ri, who is drunk. She called Su Hyeok after running away from her boyfriend while trying on wedding dresses. She is scared and anxious, but seeing her in this state, Su Hyeok becomes calm and collected, as he needs to handle her. Yu Ri and Su Hyeok needed closure in their relationship so that Yu Ri could stop hating Su Hyeok, and he could stop regretting losing her.  Su Hyeok and Yu Ri talk things out and say everything that was left out. Both of them are finally free from the burden of their breakup and wish each other well. Yu Ri notices that Su Hyeok has changed a lot, and he also realizes the same and wonders if it is because of Deborah. He goes to the engagement ceremony just in time for Ju Wan to arrive as well. Su Hyeok not only makes Ju Wan jealous, but the rest of the women are jealous of Deborah as well. However, they do not declare that they are dating, and Deborah just introduces him as a friend. Their chemistry is so good that even Yu Jeong feels that something is really going on between the two. Their plan works, and Ju Wan starts messaging Deborah. They end up meeting each other, and Deborah feels relieved after talking to him. It puts her heart at ease knowing that he was never the right guy for her, and neither was she the right woman for him. Meanwhile, her sisters, Bo Mi and Jin Ho, are having a good time as their young love blooms. Su Hyeok has been happier since he sorted things out with Yu Ri and is flirting more with Deborah. Both of them don’t understand what’s going on between them, but they are too afraid to tackle that question.  Why Does Sang Jin Reject Woo Ri?  Deborah and Su Hyeok go on a movie date with the excuse of doing research. It was Su Hyeok’s idea, and lately, he has been coming up with many innovative ideas to spend time with Deborah. They accidentally run into Su Hyeok’s parents, but neither of them is awkward. Su Hyeok’s mother is happy to finally see her son with a woman. Su Hyeok never talks about his parents, but he tells Deborah that he has a stepfather. He is on good terms with his stepfather, but seeing his mother get divorced affected him deeply. He became reclusive at the time, and since then, he hasn’t been able to express his feelings freely because it made him anxious. However, he has decided to change himself now. Meanwhile, Sang Jin finally finds the courage to clear things up with Woo Ri over her one-sided crush on him. Woo Ri has been hinting at him for quite some time, and even though he likes her, he finds it wrong to date her. He is way older than her and is also divorced. He rejects her even before she confesses her feelings. On the other hand, Su Hyeok won’t stop flirting with Deborah and even asks her to pretend to be his girlfriend at Yu Ri’s wedding. When he went to meet Yu Ri, her fiance saw them together, so he lied about being high school friends and said that he would bring his girlfriend to the wedding.  Sang Jin and Su Jin are also at Yu Ri’s wedding, as they are mutual friends. They meet their old friends at the wedding, but they start mocking Sang Jin for his divorce and keep pestering him to give them the reason. Sang Jin doesn’t know how to respond to them, so Su Jin comes to his rescue. She mocks all the married couples in return and leaves the wedding hall with Sang Jin. Sang Jin had been trying to talk things out with Su Jin, but she never gave him a chance. He finally has a chance now, and he speaks up. Right before their divorce, Sang Jin’s business was on the verge of going bankrupt, and he was struggling to pay debts to many people. He wasn’t mentally well enough to spend romantic time with Su Jin. Su Jin feels upset and realizes that she is also at fault. Sang Jin couldn’t rely on her when he was going through a tough phase in his life, but she blamed him for all the wrong reasons. However, this conversation leads them to resolve all their hard feelings toward each other. Su Jin apologizes to him, and they are back to being friends.  Su Hyeok’s flirting game is going well, and he is giving Deborah every reason to get flustered. He compliments her when she says that she doesn’t feel confident about herself. He is also subtly hinting that he likes her, but Deborah is not getting it. She still wants to believe that Su Hyeok is just a good friend. However, at the end of Episode 12 of Bora! Deborah, Deborah finds out something that she thinks is too good to be true. While going through an old collection of pictures from another friend’s wedding, she sees Su Hyeok in one of the pictures. At her friend’s engagement ceremony recently, Su Hyeok mentioned how he fell in love at first sight with Deborah when he saw her at a wedding a few years ago. Now, Deborah can’t help but wonder if his story was true and not really made up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZnVnaXRpdmVzLmNvbS9ib3JhLWRlYm9yYWgtc2Vhc29uLTEtZXBpc29kZXMtMTEtMTItcmVjYXAtZW5kaW5nLTIwMjMta2RyYW1hLXNlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-01-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T10:00:00","In January, I attended my first ever wedding. Later, I mentioned the event in passing at my publisher’s office. “Wait,” someone said. “You wrote a whole book about a wedding before you’d been to one?”  At that stage I had signed off on the final proofs of my second novel, The Happy Couple. Matrimony structures the plot; the first chapter opens with the couple getting engaged, and we follow them as the ceremony draws near. Why choose this setup when I’d never attended a wedding? Because I thought it would make a good book. To me, marriage is like extreme sports: I’m thrilled for those who partake, and have zero interest in joining them.  Marriage is a nifty narrative device. It brings together people who don’t normally meet, and occasions heaps of conflict. Also, it’s accessible. Everyone knows at least the basics of how their culture gets hitched. We acquire this familiarity as much from art as from life. That’s how I could write a novel about a wedding without ever having been to one. I researched some of the finer points, but I was largely able to rely on the knowledge I’ve absorbed from decades of media immersion, from books and poems, from paintings and song lyrics and movies.  What will become of the marriage plot in art and literature as the actual marriage rate declines? It’s a question we’ve been asking for decades; Jeffrey Eugenides’s 2011 novel The Marriage Plot offers a postmodern spin on the issue. Its heroine, reading English at Brown University, has to choose between two different men while studying virtuoso marriage plotters Jane Austen and George Eliot.  Marriage rates have since plunged even lower. That young people are tying fewer knots has triggered angst in certain quarters, though it’s hardly surprising. It’s hard enough these days for most young couples to rent a flat, never mind spend hundreds of pounds on a cake. But the real conservative bugbear isn’t that fewer people can afford to get married; it’s that fewer people actually want to. That fewer people are entering long-term romantic relationships, or seeking public validation when they do commit. That fewer people are judging themselves against traditional measures of success, or longing for a nuclear family.  When we look at post-wedding life in Austen’s novels, the success rate of marriage seems mixed at best  For the avoidance of doubt, I’m not suggesting that couples who marry can’t think for themselves. Actually, marriage nowadays is a much more active and informed choice than it was a few decades ago, precisely because it’s no longer the default. Those with personal, specific reasons are still getting married – people like my newlywed friends. But the number of people who marry in order to conform is dropping off.  It follows that the traditional marriage plot will change in art as it has in life. The popular idea is that 19th-century female novelists romanticised marriage – Eliot, the Brontë sisters, and, above all, Austen. A “Jane Austen ending” is supposedly a happily-ever-after. But when we look at post-wedding life in Austen’s novels, the success rate of marriage seems mixed at best. Besides a handful of exceptions (the Westons in Emma, say, or the Crofts in Persuasion), most spouses are either bickering or dead. Yes, we’re generally told in the final chapter that the heroine’s post-nuptial happiness will last – but Austen’s love of irony warns that we shouldn’t necessarily take the narrator’s conclusion at face value.  In 20th-century anglophone literature, the theme of marriage still dominates – but rather than the events leading up to a wedding, we’re more likely to see what happens next. Marital (and extramarital) relations lie at the heart of James Joyce’s Ulysses, DH Lawrence’s Lady Chatterley’s Lover, Virginia Woolf’s Mrs Dalloway and the work of Toni Morrison, a committed Janeite who devoured Austen’s novels throughout her childhood. While not predominately concerned with marriage, Morrison’s novels nevertheless present a similarly nuanced portrayal of the institution. As with Austen, there’s the good (marriage as an exercise of agency between enslaved people in Beloved), the bad (Mavis’s abusive husband in Paradise), and the ugly (literally all the couples in Song of Solomon).  Then there are the groundbreaking portrayals of same-sex relationships, with all their realistic flaws, in the work of authors such as James Baldwin, Djuna Barnes and Jane Bowles. While such depictions still don’t dominate mainstream art, they’ve certainly become more accessible in the 21st century. Brandon Taylor’s second novel, The Late Americans, centres on a gay friendship group where no single character must “represent” their entire community; the tension in Douglas Stuart’s Young Mungo and Shehan Karunatilaka’s The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida comes as much from community strife as from forbidden love between two men.  From the UK publication of Kristen Arnett’s novel With Teeth to Todd Field’s film Tár, starring Cate Blanchett, 2022 was a year of believable, therefore-sometimes-disastrous same-sex marriages. Meanwhile Akwaeke Emezi’s novels and Liv Little’s recent debut Rosewater take the beauty of queer love as their undisputed thematic core.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Well, it depends on the author. One can still write a convincing novel with wedlock at the centre: Monica Ali did so excellently in Love Marriage. But this testifies more to Ali’s dramatic talents than to the contemporary importance of marriage. Show a character caring about something, and the audience will care, too – whether it’s a birthday party, a frisbee contest, or a wedding. Novelists will probably always be able to persuade us that marriage is important to their characters. But they’ll have to do the work. They can no longer rely on the reader bringing that assumption to the page.  I did not write my second novel about marriage with a rabid desire to tear the whole thing down. I am not aiming to inspire a wave of divorces, though of course I’ll take it as a compliment if I do. But I did want to approach my fictional wedding with non-judgmental curiosity, tailoring the plot to the characters’ peculiarities rather than forcing a ready-to-wear outcome. I considered what made sense for my protagonists, what they’d want, how they’d behave. Once I’d worked all that out, the rest was just typing.  That’s what I want for real people, too: an awareness of what’s right for them, and the resources to bring it about. Marriage can only benefit from continuing to become less of an obligation and more of a choice. Romance itself need not be a prerequisite for personal fulfilment; we were all, in my view, put on this planet to do whatever the hell we want. The more willing we become in real life to accept unconventional happy endings, the more emboldened novelists will feel to bring them to the page.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIzL21heS8yMC9yZWFkZXItaS1saXZlZC13aXRoLWhpbS13aHktYS1oYXBweS1lbmRpbmctZG9lc250LWhhdmUtdG8tbWVhbi1tYXJyaWFnZdIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIzL21heS8yMC9yZWFkZXItaS1saXZlZC13aXRoLWhpbS13aHktYS1oYXBweS1lbmRpbmctZG9lc250LWhhdmUtdG8tbWVhbi1tYXJyaWFnZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her fiancée has been seen defending her for how good of a person she is, denying that she is a demanding client as she has recently been criticized. But today is a day to put problems aside and focus on something very special: the wedding of some great friends.  Isabel Preysler attended the wedding of Lucía Domínguez Vega-Penichet and Álvaro Gomis together with Tamara Falcó and Ana Boyer. All the press came quickly to ask the mother of the future fiancée about the topic of the moment. Asking the press to hurry up because they were late, she claimed to be fine right now.  She was silent when asked if, thanks to her, Tamara has gotten a dress for her big day. Neither of them revealed if she will finally wear a Cristina Herrera dress at the link as rumored. Ana Boyer walked a few steps ahead of her sister and her mother, she being a mere spectator of the scene like the police officers who were there.  Mother and daughters entered the church of Santa Bárbara together to enjoy the wedding of one of the family’s closest friends. Demonstrating once again how united they are, it was to be expected that they would want to share this day.

Get the latest news from Peaky Blinders straight to your inbox  Family feuds are among the most volatile situations which can all too frequently end in violence. Petty squabbles can quickly get out of hand and escalate to attacks on the streets.  Hurt pride and damaged egos can often overrule any sense of diplomacy or a desire to resolve things peacefully. This year we have covered a number of criminal cases involving long-running disputes including rows within the same family as well as rivalries between two separate packs.  Read through our roundup below which includes a trio showoff brothers compared to the Peaky Blinders, sisters-in-law who plunged a wedding into chaos and a 'public act of war' which resulted in the murder of a dad.  READ MORE: Drunk man left Ryanair passengers scared with antics on flight to Birmingham  Driver ran over friend 'like a skittle' after row over his wife    (Image: West Midlands Police)  Mohammed Hassan mowed down his friend 'like a skittle' following a dispute over his wife. The 46-year-old performed a U-turn and then drove over the victim again in Garrison Lane, Small Heath.  Previously, Hassan had arranged for his friend to marry his former sister-in-law but regretted the move and launched a campaign of harassment as he tried to control her. In one incident he removed her from the property and attacked her.  A couple of days later he met with his friend to hash out their differences but they ended up arguing. Hassan grabbed his friend's beard, who in-turn pulled the handbrake on the car to get out. It was then that he was ran over.  Hassan of Rollaston Road, Dudley, was convicted of attempted murder as well as pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and harassment. He was sentenced to 21 years.  Showoff Solihull brothers told 'you are not the Peaky Blinders' amid family feud  (Image: Birmingham Live)  Abbas brothers Ali, Zain and Bilal together with relative Mohammed Javed caused havoc on Coventry Road, Small Heath as they targeted a family member following a long-running feud. They turned up in a Volkswagen Golf, some armed with weapons, and started shouting: 'We're here to kill you' and 'we're going to f*** you up'.  Javed drove the Golf back and forth at speed before Zain Abbas got into the victim's Mercedes van and drove off. Two people suffered minor injuries as they were struck by vehicles in the incident.  The Abbas brothers, of The Crescent in Solihull, and Javed, of Coleshill Road, Marston Green, admitted affray and were sentenced to 12-month community orders. Zain Abbas and Javed also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and were banned from the roads for a year.  Judge Richard Bond compared the family to the notorious Birmingham gang who were associated with Small Heath in the 1890s but he told them: 'You are not the Peaky Blinders '. Outside Birmingham Crown Court the defendants posed for pictures in front of a luxury black car before leaving.  Mum of nine put on tag after taking 'revenge' on sister-in-law at wedding  (Image: Birmingham Live)  Halima Ahmed threw a plate at her sister-in-law Zainab Ahmed at a wedding in Small Heath leaving her disabled. They got into a row at the Bia Lounge Wedding Hall having fallen out a few years earlier.  Zainab, 57, threw a biscuit at Halima, 55, who launched a flask of coffee which fortunately missed. Halima then tossed the plate which Zainab was able to deflect away but to the cost of her arm which suffered a deep cut resulting in ongoing problems.  Halima, a mum-of-nine, of Dirleton Road, Newham, in London, admitted unlawful wounding. She was spared prison, partly due to her poor physical health and the impact it would have on her youngest children. She was instead sentenced to 12 months suspended for 18 months, which included a 16-week electronically monitored curfew between 8pm and 6am.  How bitter family feud escalated to violent murder of dad on his birthday  Hassan Tasleem and Gurdeep Sandhu murdered taxi-boss Mohammed Haroon Zeb in a 'public act of war' amid a bitter feud between two rival families. They killed him in a drive-by shooting as the 39-year-old dad-of-four pulled up outside his home in Queens Cross, Dudley, shortly after 12.30am on January 31, 2021.  Tasleem pulled the trigger of a revolver five times from a Volkswagen Golf driven by Sandhu, who slowed down to put him in position. Mr Zeb, who was killed on his birthday, was not thought to be involved in the wider feud which had included previous acts of violence and another murder.  Tasleem, 25, of Richmond Road, Dudley, and Sandhu, 25, of Blowers Green Road, Dudley, were convicted of murder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and perverting the course of justice. They were both sentenced for life and a minimum 30 years in jail.  Shamraz Ali, aged 21, of Tanfield Road, Dudley, was convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to five years.

With the new trending flavours on the market, intending couples are spoilt for choice, but they need to be careful when choosing.    Fatia Hassan, the Marketing Manager of Cafe Javas says that many non-traditional flavours can be incorporated into a wedding cake.    ""For example caramel and coconut, chocolate fudge and vanilla, red velvet, and others. The couple decides to use their favourite flavours in harmony,"" she says.    There is also the option of having a different flavour for each cake tier.    ""Some rich flavours like chocolate fudge can be overwhelming so another way to present them is in the form of cupcakes or slices for guests. Alternatively, there can be smaller size tiers alongside the main cake,"" she reveals.    Other desserts like ice cream alongside the cake are great, but the couple needs to have practical ways to keep it frozen.    ""You cannot expect the ice cream to stay in its form for two hours, but instead there are macarons as an alternative form of dessert,"" she advised.    The intending couple should start looking for their wedding cake service provider as soon as the wedding date is set and must book a cake-tasting session with their provider.    ""They should strive to create rapport between themselves and the service providers so that they communicate their desires well,"" she says.    Hassan says that majority of the trending cake flavours are delicate and need to be consumed a few days after the wedding because the cake is usually freshly baked and has no preservatives so it might go stale if poorly kept for long.    She says for the few days it is still available refrigerate it for better preservation.    The Bride and Groom expo 2023 will be awash with the best wedding cake service providers, from whom a couple can choose.  The event is slated for 23-25 th June at the UMA main exhibition hall in Lugogo.

"wedding","2016-11-24","Not Discerned","{""Bihar"", ""Bihar"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T02:10:20","I was never a fan of marriage rituals, especially those borrowed from Bollywood. Juta chhupana (hiding the groom’s shoes) was not a part of marriage ceremonies in my family till Hum Aapke Hain Kaun became a wedding template for Indians.  I was in principle against the concept of demanding money from my elder sister’s groom for a pair of shoes he had already paid for. So, when my cousins insisted on hiding my brother-in-law’s mojari, I decided to guard it instead. My cousins had the last laugh as they negotiated the shoes for Rs 5,000 and divided it among themselves. My failed attempt to protect the shoes became a family joke, but I never regretted my decision to not be a part of that “extortion” bid. My non-participation was my will.  That year was 2005. The next wedding in my family took place over a decade later, in the month PM Narendra Modi made the demonetisation announcement. My brother’s wedding was fixed on November 24, 2016. That wedding, I spent almost entirely waiting in bank queues in my hometown in Bihar, hoping to withdraw Rs 10,000 per day from four different banks.  I watched my brother from a distance as women, mostly married aunts and cousins, applied haldi on his face and body. My mother, given her ‘widowed’ status (my father had passed away in 2011), did not want to take part in the ritual and I, the unmarried elder sister in charge of organising the wedding, had several other things to manage — decorators, gen sets, halwais, bandwallahs and wedding shopping.  Not many missed me. They needed a byahta (married woman) to perform the rituals and my sister was the obvious choice. My single status left them confused. Should I be allowed to take part in the ceremonies? I, too, didn’t volunteer, perhaps in the same fix as my mother when it came to marriage rituals. How could I convince her when I lacked clarity myself? Being single isn’t easy and explaining your status to others is worse. It’s this awkwardness, I guess, that pushes most single women away from crowded family functions.  On the day of the wedding, my sister decided to stay home to prepare for the bride’s welcome the next day. My mother had already declared that she won’t go with the baarat and I volunteered to stay with them. There were too many relatives ready to “represent” us at the wedding.  In the afternoon, as the baarat preparations began, an uncle told me we could withdraw Rs 25,000 by showing the wedding card at the bank.  Advertisement  I ran to the nearest branch, but a crowd had already gathered there, a wedding card in each hand. I don’t know how many of those cards were fake, but the bank soon ran out of cash. I was worried about getting late for the baarat. I wanted to see if my brother’s sherwani had been altered correctly and if the mojari matched it. I wanted to be there when he wore the maur (headgear) and protect him from overenthusiastic aunts trying to ward off evil eyes with extra coats of kajal.  By 5 pm, a bank employee handed me a bundle of Rs 500 notes and I ran to my home, barely 500 metres away. At the door, my uncle told me the baarat departure had been advanced by an hour due to traffic issues. Standing on the stairs, sweating on a cold November evening in a cotton salwar-kurta, I felt like an outsider at my brother’s wedding. I hugged him and slipped the cash into his pocket. The baarat left with our relatives. My sister and mother stood at the door, teary-eyed.  Looking at myself, I felt cheated. “You said you didn’t want to go,” she said, holding my hand. My eyes fell on our hands. Those were the only palms without henna colours. I guess this time my non-participation was everyone’s will.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvc2luZ2xlLWFuZC1zaW5nbGVkLW91dC04NjIwMzQ1L9IBVmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvc2luZ2xlLWFuZC1zaW5nbGVkLW91dC04NjIwMzQ1L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The son, surnamed Lai (賴), fell to his death from a 10th-floor residence in Taichung owned by a man surnamed Sia (夏).  The mother told a news conference that Sia, an assistant at a land administration company owned by Lai’s father, on May 4 invited Lai out, promising that he would “teach him how to handle his real estate.”  A woman speaks at a news conference in Taichung on Friday at which she accused a man of tricking her son into a same-sex marriage to gain legal rights to his inheritance. Photo: Tsai Shu-yuan, Taipei Times  However, Sia took Lai to the Household Registration Office in Beitun District (北屯) to register themselves as a same-sex couple, the mother said.  Lai died less than two hours after the marriage certificate was issued, she said.  Sia’s actions suggested premeditation, as he had asked Lai to transfer the deeds for the land to the company, she said.  The Taichung District Prosecutors’ Office said that it has listed Sia as a suspect in the case, adding that he posted bail of NT$300,000 after detention was deemed unnecessary.  The Civil Code stipulates that same-sex marriages give partners the same legal rights as other marriages, including inheritance rights.  A lawyer for the mother, surnamed Hsu (許), told the news conference that the marriage was “absurd,” as the two had only met twice, with the first time being last month.  Lai’s mother said that her son had recently started university and had been looking for a girlfriend.  The witnesses to the marriage had been two random people, she said.  The prosecutors’ office said that an autopsy had been conducted on May 12 and it was awaiting the report.  A funeral parlor said that despite Lai falling 10 stories, his body was largely intact, with only one broken arm and little sign of blood, Chinese-language media reported.  Lai inherited 30 plots of land from his paternal grandfather, who was also his biological father, the reports said.  The grandfather had slept with Lai’s mother, an immigrant from China who was married to one of his sons, they said, adding that the father, who died last month, had adopted Lai.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL3RhaXdhbi9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIzLzA1LzIxLzIwMDM4MDAxNjXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On Saturday, the Sex And The City actress seemingly shared some of the details of how the couple celebrated their marriage milestone in an Instagram post that featured the simple photo of a champagne cork.  'Happy 26th anniversary, my husband,' Parker, 58, began in the caption. 'That sure was a nice celebration and a real nice bottle of champagne. And a gorgeous walk home.'  She ended the special post by reflecting back on the many years they have shared: 'Oh the miles we have strolled together. I love you. XOX, your SJ.'  The couple first met back in November 1991 when her brothers Pippin and Tobey Parker co-founded the Naked Angels Theater Company in New York City, and Broderick was hired to direct one of the plays, according to People.  Marriage milestone: Sarah Jessica Parker, 58, paid tribute to her husband Matthew Broderick, 61, on their 26th wedding anniversary on Saturday; pictured in 2022  Founded in 1986, Naked Angels would 'soon became the 'it' place for rising young actors and playwrights that also included the likes of Marisa Tomei, Mary Stuart Masterson, Gina Gershon, Helen Slater and Rob Morrow, among many others.  About five-and-a-half-years later, the couple decided to make their union legal and tie-the-knot, but they didn't let their 1000 guest know ahead of time.  Wanting to surprise everyone, they sent out a standard party invitation, which ultimately led to them exchanging their vows at the Angel Oresanz Synagogue on the Lower East Side of Downtown Manhattan.  The intimate civil ceremony was followed by a reception full of show tunes that continued into the overnight hours, according to Brides.  In a move to avoid attracting attention to their surprise wedding, the fashionista would reveal she wore a ruffled, black Morgane Le Fay dress for her wedding, and confess that it was the first thing she saw when she bought it off the rack.

The Honourable James and Lady Cara Willoughby submitted an application for their scheme to North Yorkshire Council in April, with Lady Cara describing the transformation of the kitchen, servants’ quarters and stores as a ‘modern nightclub’.  A bar, sprung dancefloor and toilets would be installed in the basements of the North-East Wing, with an outdoor hospitality area also added. The space would be aimed at guests of weddings and private events, and would not be open to the public.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  The estate near Malton has been in the Willoughby family’s ownership since the 16th century, and the Elizabethan house was remodelled in 1749, with more wings added in 1776 and 1872.  Birdsall House is an Elizabethan hall near Malton  The North-East Wing’s domestic offices fell out of use after World War Two, during which the house was requisitioned by the army, and the number of staff employed in the kitchens then declined significantly. Other than the installation of heating and electrics, the rooms have remained almost untouched ever since.  A heritage statement submitted by the family’s consultants reads: “This historical and architectural character of the house and grounds is largely that of the late 19th century, as devised by Anthony Salvin. His scheme of works included the extension and remodelling of the North-East Wing.  ""As seen today, the exterior of the North-East Wing dates to the late 19th century; the interior is of similar date though some fixtures and fittings are early 20th century. Most of the east face of the North-East Wing sits below ground level, with some self-set trees/shrubs and mature yews obscuring views of the block from the front.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  ""The proposed development includes sympathetic conservation, restoration and interpretation of the North-East Wing’s interior, keeping most of the historic fixtures and fittings, to create a unique hospitality space which complements the House’s fledgeling events business. In doing so, these private, unutilised, unheated spaces – that have been and will continue to disintegrate - will be made accessible for the first time to visitors and support the economic sustainability of the estate.”  Lady Cara Willoughby  The project involves the creation of new entrances, the lowering of the ground level to reveal the original east facade, and installation of steps and access ramp.  According to the heritage report, there were 25 servants at Birdsall in 1861, but by 1921 this had dropped to 11. There was a butler, housekeeper, cook, ladies maid, governess, nurse, footmen, valet, page, gardeners, grooms, housemaids, kitchen and laundry maids.  The North-East Wing was rebuilt with extended service quarters for the eighth Lord Middleton in the 1870s, as he had 13 children and regularly entertained large house parties. The estate suffered during the world wars, when the 11th Lord Middleton had to pay crippling death duties, and after 1945, the area was used only for storage.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  The service wing contains storerooms, larders, a dairy, game chiller, main kitchen, scullery, servants’ halls, housekeeper’s office, laundry and wine cellar, with an ice house outside.  Under the Willoughby family's ownership, Birdsall has always been a 'party house' where guests gathered to hunt and shoot. Pictured in 1926 are Middleton Hunt Ball guests, including Lord Hotham of Hotham Hall near Beverley.  The report adds: “At present some evening events must take place within a marquee which is not only expensive, but also takes people away from the main house and all that it has to offer. The proposed work intends to remove the need for a marquee, by providing an attractive and accessible area within the existing envelope of Birdsall House. The repurposing will bring back into use a part of the house that has not been used since the 1940s; during which time only the most basic of maintenance has taken place, leading to fabric deterioration.”  The bar will be in the former laundry and later meat larder and scullery. Original features such as the early 20th-century iron cooking range and Belfast sinks will be preserved. A dancefloor will be built over the kitchen’s stone flags. The vegetable store, which has a hatch window for deliveries of produce, will be reinstated and become operational again.  The application is currently under consideration.  James, a barrister and heir to his father’s title of Lord Middleton, and Cara, a former graphic designer and daughter of the Earl of Cork, live at Birdsall House with their children Thomas, Flora and Rupert.

"wedding","2021-05-21","Not Discerned","{""NewDelhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T06:40:24","New Delhi, May 21 (IANSlife) Indian weddings are renowned for their grandeur and cultural significance, deeply rooted in traditions that have been passed down through generations. However, as society evolves and modernises, so does the institution of marriage and the roles played by families in Indian weddings. In recent years, a discernible shift has taken place, redefining the dynamics and responsibilities of families during this momentous celebration.  The International Day of Families, observed on May 15 each year, serves as a meaningful occasion to not only acknowledge the importance of families but also to examine their role in shaping cultural practices, such as weddings, within specific contexts. In Indian society, where weddings hold immense significance and where the wedding market is a $50 bn+ industry, it is crucial to explore the evolving dynamics of families within this realm. Let’s take a deeper look to understand the changing dynamics and emerging trends:  Embracing Individual Choices:  Traditionally, Indian weddings were initiated, decided and planned by parents and elders, with limited inputs from the couple. However, in contemporary Indian society, there is a growing emphasis on individual choices and preferences. Couples are increasingly empowered to make decisions not only regarding choosing their partners but also around their wedding ceremonies, guest lists, their choice of wedding venues and vendors as well as every possible detail around their special day. Families are happily adapting to this paradigm shift by embracing the desires and aspirations of the couple, encouraging personal autonomy while providing guidance and support as we see an increasing focus on prioritising the couple’s happiness in the celebration.  Collaborative Planning:  Gone are the days when wedding planning was solely the responsibility of the bride’s family. Today, families on both sides actively participate in the planning process, creating a collaborative and inclusive environment. Parents and siblings of the bride and groom discuss ideas, share responsibilities, and work together to organise a memorable event. There is also an increasing trend of many events being shared between the families. This collective involvement fosters stronger bonds between families and promotes a sense of unity, as they collectively embark on the journey of celebrating love and commitment.  Changing financial realities have prompted a re-evaluation of spending areas  Indian weddings have long been known for their lavishness, with elaborate ceremonies, opulent decorations, and extravagant feasts. However, changing financial realities have prompted a re-evaluation of spending areas. So while on one side many families have been opting for intimate and budget-conscious celebrations we also do continue seeing higher-budget weddings the common thread in all is prioritising personal experiences. This shift has resulted in a more balanced and inclusive approach, where families come together to contribute their resources, equally distributing the financial burden, easing it for both sides, and ensuring a memorable wedding without compromising on quality. We have also observed that couples financing their own weddings is becoming quite common in India, especially amongst millennials. Our data survey revealed that almost 40 per cent of them have contributed in one way or the other in the new normal.  Redefining customs:  Owing to the cultural shifts, families are becoming more open to the ideas and preferences of all. This is also leading to a shift in societal norms and traditions. These days families are redefining customs as per the preferences and convenience of their loved ones. For instance, our September 2021 data survey reported a 76 per cent surge in the demand for non-saaya wedding dates. Even though this surge was primarily driven by the pandemic and cancellations, it has stayed snd it depicts the change in the mindset of the new generation. This shift is also evident in multiple other customs such as the division of gifting between groom and bride’s family, acceptance of a woman priest, and letting go of traditions like Kanyadaan and Bidaai.  Blending Traditions with Modernity:  While families adapt to changing dynamics, they also strive to preserve their cultural heritage. The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture involves finding a delicate balance between honouring traditions and embracing modernity. Families are re-imagining rituals, incorporating new elements, and experimenting with innovative ideas while staying rooted in the essence of their cultural practices. This harmonious blend of tradition and modernity reflects the evolving Indian society, where families celebrate their customs while embracing the winds of change.  The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture reflects the larger shifts happening in society. With a focus on individual choices, collaborative planning, financial prudence, gender equality, and cultural evolution, families are redefining the way weddings are organised and celebrated. These changes not only foster stronger bonds between families but also empower individuals to embrace their uniqueness. As Indian weddings continue to evolve, the changing roles of families serve as a testament to the adaptability, inclusiveness, and resilience of Indian society while continuously reminding us of the fact that no celebration is complete till you have your family to celebrate it with.

Not only did many consumers have piles of those iconic 20% off coupons just waiting to be spent, but many people realized that finding a replacement store for low-cost household goods would be easier said than done.  But as much as the closure of Bed Bath & Beyond has been a blow to everyday consumers, it's been problematic for engaged couples. That's because Bed Bath & Beyond was a popular place for couples to register for wedding gifts.  But if you're tying the knot, you're not out of luck. There are plenty of other options for creating a wedding registry. You'll just want to explore your choices carefully and make sure you understand the return policy for each.  1. Macy's  Macy's carries a range of kitchen gadgets, linens, towels, and other items that are perfect for couples who are buying a home for the first time or moving into a new one. Those who register at Macy's can benefit from a newlywed discount on the purchases they make off of their own registries and discounts on select product categories.  As far as returns goes, you can take items you received off of your registry back to Macy's up to 90 days past your wedding date or past the date those items were purchased -- whichever is sooner. From there, you can get store credit or exchange unwanted gifts for new purchases.  2. Target  Target is a great place to register for wedding gifts because the big-box giant has a massive selection of products to choose from. You can register for not just kitchenware and sheets, but furniture items, lamps, throw blankets, rugs, and other household accessories.  Plus, Target will give you a 15% off coupon you can apply to any leftover items on your registry that remain unpurchased once your wedding date passes. You can also return registry items for up to a year.  3. Amazon  There are plenty of good reasons to register for wedding gifts on Amazon. First, you can enjoy a 20% completion discount, which allows you to buy unpurchased items from your registry for less money. You can also return unwanted registry items within 180 days.  Amazon also offers a group gifting feature so that if you want to register for higher-priced items, your guests will be allowed to contribute money toward them. You can also have guests contribute to gift cards you can use on Amazon to buy just about anything -- perhaps some new swimwear for your upcoming honeymoon, or an e-reader to take on your trip.  Shopping at Bed Bath & Beyond often meant racking up a lower credit card tab than shopping at other stores. You might not only miss Bed Bath & Beyond, but be disappointed that you can't use it for your wedding registry. But thankfully, there are other options you can look at so your guests don't have to rack their brains trying to figure out what gifts to give you.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29sLmNvbS90aGUtYXNjZW50L3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ2V0dGluZy1tYXJyaWVkLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLXRvLXJlZ2lzdGVyLW5vdy10aGF0LWJlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZC1pcy1uby1tb3JlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We Have Some Insight For You  The happy day has come to start wedding dress shopping. While it's an exciting time, there's also a lot to keep in mind when choosing your dress for the big day. For many brides, there are several factors to consider that can feel overwhelming. There are so many bridal shops to choose from that it can be a process trying to narrow things down — plus, you want to start browsing with enough time to allow for alterations. The price point is another factor. Wedding dresses can be hugely expensive but, thankfully, they don't have to be. Have a very clear budget in mind before you venture forth. And don't forget about the cost of alterations, as well as your veil and shoes.  If you're going dress shopping in person, keep in mind a few vital points. Firstly, note who you want to bring with you. A few close friends or family members who will support you and give you honest feedback are a lifesaver. Also, bring the underwear and shapewear that you hope to use on your wedding day, so you can get a clearer picture of exactly how the dress will look. Nude is best since it won't show through. Bring the heels you plan on wearing, so you can gauge hem length. It's also advantageous for dress consultants if you bring some images of your ideal dresses. Those visual guides can be hugely helpful in narrowing down a suitable selection.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWVuLmNvbS8xMjkwMDU4L3N0YXJ0LXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3Mtc2hvcHBpbmctdGlwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The day was marked by pomp and ceremony, with senior royals turning up in all their finery and a 2,000 strong congregation singing powerful hymns as Charles was officially crowned King.

"wedding","2023-07-16","Not Discerned","{""Kvareli"", ""Kakheti"", ""Georgia""}","2023-05-20T15:21:33","Lavrov’s daughter in Georgia  16 activists were detained in the Kakheti region of Georgia during a protest against the arrival in the country of the family members of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergei Lavrov, who are under international sanctions.  According to the participants of the protest, a wedding is taking place at the hotel “Kvareli Lake” with the participation of Lavrov’s daughter Ekaterina Vinokurova and her husband. His brother is getting married, according to available data, and he is paying for the wedding.  Among the participants of the protest are members of the opposition groups: the political movement “Droa” and the party “National Movement”.  Photo: Georgian edition of Radio Liberty    In addition to the fact that since morning there is a campaign in Kvareli, customers leave negative comments and ratings on the Facebook page of the hotel “Kvareli Lake”.  Ekaterina Lavrova in Georgia?  This information has not yet been confirmed by any official agency. The administration of the complex refutes this information. They claim that there are no guests from Russia in the hotel, including members of the Lavrov family.  For the first time, information about the presence of the Lavrov family in Georgia was disseminated by the leader of the Droa movement, Elene Khoshtaria, and the TV company Mtavari Arkhi. Khoshtaria says that the couple signed in Tbilisi, and the party was planned in Kakheti.  Information about the signing is confirmed by photos shared on Facebook by Lavrov’s son Mika Vinokurov.  A journalist from the Mtavari TV channel called the Kvareli Lake Hotel to check the information. He introduced himself as an employee of a flower shop and said that the bouquet was ordered in the name of Ekaterina Lavrova. The hotel representative asked for time to check, then confirmed that a guest with that name was staying at the hotel.  However, after this information appeared in the press, the hotel denied the visit of Ekaterina Lavrova and published a special statement, which mentions that not a single guest in their hotel is registered under the name of Lavrov.  Ekaterina Lavrova officially uses her husband’s surname, Vinokurova, and even on Wikipedia she is mentioned under this surname.  The hotel and the territory adjacent to it are closed and no one is allowed to go there. But the hotel administration says that the reason is that the hotel is overcrowded and in such cases its territory is always closed.  According to the leader of the “Droa” Elene Khoshtaria, most of the guests came from Vladikavkaz through the Upper Lars checkpoint. “They filmed videos on the road and shared them on social media,” says Khoshtaria.  As for Lavrov’s daughter and son-in-law, Khoshtaria does not know how they got to Georgia. However, she is sure that without the consent of the authorities and the security service of Georgia, this could not have happened.  Information also spread that the Russian guests were staying at another hotel in the Kakheti region, the Akhasheni Wine Resort, but this hotel also issued a refutation.  “We will not allow liberal-fascist agitation” – the reaction of the Georgian government  The chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Irakli Kobakhidze, called the protest of part of society in connection with the arrival of members of the Lavrov family “xenophobic”.  “We predicted that as the tourist season approached, a new wave of xenophobic campaign would definitely begin, and now it has come true,” Kobakhidze said.  “Xenophobia is not in the nature of Georgian society. This is an offshoot of the liberal-fascist agitation, and I urge everyone to refrain from doing so. There is no place for xenophobia in Georgia.”  He said that there are double standards on the part of the opposition:  “You remember their attitude after 2008, when the wedding of Mikhalkov’s son took place in Georgia, then [with protest] the then President Mikheil Saakashvili personally arrived at the event. We all remember the excited positions of the fascist liberals at that time. Today, the same people are coming out with a xenophobic campaign.  These are double standards that testify to political goals. Their goal is escalation, and the main provocateurs here are Khoshtaria, Melia and others.”  “I wonder what kind of connections Elena Khoshtaria has, who will be the first to know about the arrival of Russian guests in Georgia,” Kobakhidze said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2phbS1uZXdzLm5ldC9kYXVnaHRlci1vZi1sYXZyb3YtaW4tZ2VvcmdpYS1hdC10aGUtd2VkZGluZy13aGlsZS1zaGUtaXMtdW5kZXItc2FuY3Rpb25zLXByb3Rlc3QtYWN0aW9uLWluLWtha2hldGktYW5kLWFycmVzdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nothing comes easy for the fan-favorite couple, though, and the merriment surrounding the nuptials was diminished slightly by the murder of Carlos’ father days earlier. Following the ceremony, T.K.’s uncle also passed away, ending his own life amidst a battle with Huntington’s disease . These are issues the newlyweds are going to continue to deal with when 9-1-1: Lone Star returns for Season 5, and Tarlos actors Ronen Rubinstein and Rafael Silva spoke about what’s next for their characters.  While we witnessed the terrible effect Carlos’ grief had on him following the shooting of his father Gabriel (Benito Martinez), we did not see T.K. learn about his uncle’s passing, in which Robert (guest star Chad Lowe) enlisted the help of his brother Owen (Rob Lowe) to help him end his life. Ronen Rubinstein told EW he hopes we’ll get to see that conversation between Owen and T.K.:  I really hope they start next season on the next day. I want to get into it. I want to see him find out from Owen, right? But when will that be? I'm not sure if he'll be completely comfortable talking about it right away, especially after his son just got married. Owen and TK have been sharing bad news for four seasons now, so maybe he wants to give him a little bit of a break. I'm very interested to see what that secret does to Owen. That's probably going to F him up pretty good.  How the Strand-Reyes family continues to handle those deaths — and particularly Owen losing another brother — was also one of the questions I had after the season finale . T.K. didn’t know Robert very well, but his reaction to Owen’s role in the death, if his dad even chooses to share that, is going to be very interesting.  Rafael Silva weighed in on his character’s state of mind as well, saying there’s no way Gabriel’s murder doesn’t change everything for Carlos going forward. He told the trade:  Carlos has changed — but how? Is he still a police officer? Has he abandoned the force, or is he in it more than ever? Is he neglecting? Is he accepting? Is he angry? Is he depressed? Is he seeing a therapist? Has he gone crazy? Has he tried to take this matter into his own hands? I'm excited to see how Carlos deals with grief.  Also at play, Ronen Rubinstein said, is how T.K. and Carlos are there for each other as husbands, and he acknowledged that his character is going to be afraid of what might happen to Carlos.  Hopefully it won’t all be grief and trauma, though, because they’re officially married now, and if any couple is deserving of some newlywed bliss, it’s Tarlos. That’s a big thing that Rafael Silva said he’s also looking forward to in Season 5, saying:  But I'm also excited to see who Carlos is as a husband. I'm also excited to see if TK knocks on Carlos' door and is like, ‘Hey, you ready to have a kid yet? Can we talk about this?’","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vdGVsZXZpc2lvbi85LTEtMS1sb25lLXN0YXJzLXJvbmVuLXJ1Ymluc3RlaW4tYW5kLXJhZmFlbC1zaWx2YS1vbi13aGF0LWNvbWVzLW5leHQtYWZ0ZXItdGFybG9zLXdlZGRpbmctYW5kLXRob3NlLWZpbmFsZS1kZWF0aHPSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A new study has revealed some shocking bachelor and bachelorette party statistics.  t appears pre-wedding shenanigans aren’t always an innocent night with your nearest and dearest.  A new study in America has revealed more than 70 per cent of soon-to-be spouses have cheated on their partner while indulging in bachelor and bachelorette night festivities.  The New York Post has reported a survey of 6000 people - conducted by Bonus Finder - found that an overwhelming majority of almost husband’s and wife’s used the night as a last night of freedom and engaged in usually frowned upon activities like flirting, sexting or sleeping with someone else.  The survey found the main act of cheating came in the form of lap dances, which 33.1 per cent of people said they had received before their wedding, while 21.3 per cent of people said they had kissed someone that wasn’t their partner.  Bachelorette parties are also known as hens nights in New Zealand. Photo / 123RF  Meanwhile 11.2 per cent of people said they had slept with someone other than their partner.  Speaking to the US news outlet, Bela Gandhi, founder of Smart Dating Academy said the reason why people indulge in the activities at their pre-wedding party can come from a lot of different factors, “These events are often fuelled by alcohol, controlled substances, peer pressure, and a lack of communication between partners.”  She added, “It just goes to show what people think is OK culturally at these events, versus having these conversations with their partners.”  Bachelor and Bachelorette parties are also known as stag and hens nights in New Zealand and are a celebration of a person before they get married.  The party is seen as a “last night of freedom” however it’s more a space for the hen (bride) or stag (groom) to celebrate their upcoming nuptials with their friends and bond with them. The parties can last a night or a weekend and can happen anywhere from the week before the wedding to months before.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmV3LXN1cnZleS1zaG93cy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNzAtcGVyLWNlbnQtb2YtYW1lcmljYW5zLWNoZWF0LWF0LXRoZWlyLXByZS13ZWRkaW5nLXBhcnR5LzdZT0hCVk1WQU5DRkRDMkZYTFE1S09MN01RL9IBpAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmV3LXN1cnZleS1zaG93cy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNzAtcGVyLWNlbnQtb2YtYW1lcmljYW5zLWNoZWF0LWF0LXRoZWlyLXByZS13ZWRkaW5nLXBhcnR5LzdZT0hCVk1WQU5DRkRDMkZYTFE1S09MN01RLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But what if I tell you that now you can say ""I do"" or tie the knots in space?  By 2024, a space travel company called Space Perspective plans to revolutionize the wedding market by delivering space weddings. Couples will travel for six hours to the edge of space where they would exchange vows in front of the Earth's curvature, according to the company's plans.  Eight passengers and one pilot will be able to travel on the six-hour Spaceship Neptune trip in cozy, reclining chairs. But it can also be altered to accommodate unique demands.  The Neptune spacecraft from Space Perspective is distinguished by its dedication to giving couples a secure and tranquil experience. Space travel is as safe as boarding a regular airplane with a 19 kmph gradual rise.  The spacecraft Neptune is launched into orbit by the company's SpaceBalloon. It then uses renewable hydrogen to propel itself without the need for rockets or leaving a carbon footprint. With no rockets or related carbon footprint, the spacecraft is driven by renewable hydrogen, providing an environmentally friendly trip to the stars.  Additionally, it has enormous porthole windows, which will make a unique setting for wedding photos. The windows of Neptune are ""the biggest windows flown into space"" & have a unique anti-UV coating in addition to being made of highly durable material.  What is Space tourism and Possibilities India might have it  For individuals seeking to create a genuinely one-of-a-kind and unforgettable event for their wedding day, this new endeavor is an exciting development. Many people have always found the thought of traveling to space fascinating, and now it is practical for couples to do so on their wedding day.  The six-hour Neptune journey can carry passengers 100,000 feet above the Earth before lowering them back to it. It will start official operations in 2024 and as per reports they have sold around 1,000 tickets already.  Photo Credit: Twitter  But do you know the cost and waiting list for it?  It is $1,25,000 (INR 1 crore) and the waiting list to get married among the stars, according to Jane Poynter, co-founder of Space Perspective, is already light-years long.  Two former Biosphere 2 crew members created Space Perspective to investigate the feasibility of closed ecological systems to sustain human life during space voyages.

The caramel-toned beauty and her filmmaker hubby secretly tied the knot in a low-key ceremony sometime in 2022. Following the revelation of their nuptials, the songstress slowly satisfied the public’s curiosity with little details about her love story.  After months of mystery, the “How We Do” hitmaker recently dived into the dynamic duo’s romance, sharing new information about the lovebirds’ journey down the aisle. Keep reading to learn more about the elusive couple.  Rita Ora Reveals Her Wedding To Taika Waititi Did Not Follow The Conventional Route  In a recent heart-to-heart discussion with “Glamour UK“ for the magazine’s cover story, the “Soul Survivor” singer got candid about her relationship with the Hollywood icon. The chart-topper, who refused to reveal the couple’s wedding date, confessed the pair did not have a formal proposal.  “Well, honestly, there was no real getting down on one knee. It was more like, ‘I want to marry you. Let’s just do it,'” the entertainer explained, noting that she favored the lovebirds’ decision to skip the engagement phase.  Despite being known for serenading thousands at her concerts, the Bambi Award winner admitted she disliked having an extravagant wedding ceremony. Sharing her thoughts on the matter, the 32-year-old stated:  “Some women like to feel that real special attention that day. And everyone’s different. And for me – I think with my job, it is all… it’s very attention driven – I wanted to keep it private because my life and my career aren’t.”  Because the English songwriter wanted a low-key ceremony, her preparations for the wedding were tied to two crucial factors — her career and Waititi’s two daughters from a previous marriage.  Opening up about their importance to the ceremony, the entertainer said: “The wedding was planned in two to three days, when I was out of cycle, which is what I call it when I’m not in album cycle mode. And his kids were there, and I really wanted them to be a part of it.”  The MOBO Award recipient continued, “It was either then or we had to wait for ages. I didn’t want to do it without my stepkids there. So, we just figured it out, and we did it. And it was perfect.”  Still raving about her “dream” wedding, the “Body on Me” artist explained that her sister made it to the ceremony while her parents gave their blessings via Zoom. Meanwhile, the groom’s guest list only included his two daughters, which Ora claimed was “amazing” for the filmmaker.  All About The Teen Choice Award Nominee’s Wedding Dress & Second Ceremony Plans  For her big day, the 32-year-old rocked a stunning wedding dress from one of her favorite designers, Tom Ford. The songstress revealed that she always dreamt of involving the famous stylist in her ceremony after falling in love with one of his earlier outfits.  According to Ora, she had never forgotten the white lace dress and full-length veil ensemble she saw at Ford’s 2018 fashion show. As fate would have it, the same attire was present when she shopped for her wedding dress.  “I went to Tom Ford’s shop to see if they had any wedding dresses. And they had this one wedding dress. So bizarre. I’m not even joking; it was on my mood board. Not that I’m crazy,” the entertainer exclaimed. “But it was the one dress I wanted, and it was there, ready. And it fitted. It was meant to be.”  Aside from the luxury brand founder, the “You Only Love Me” singer confessed that none of her friends knew about her wedding to Waititi. The 32-year-old told her pals after the ceremony. However, no one seemed shocked about her decision.  “No one knew. No one was surprised. They were like, ‘I’m so happy for you. And when can we just throw a big rager?'” the caramel-toned beauty explained. Regarding the possibility of a second wedding ceremony, the Glamour Award honoree had no specific plans.  “Maybe sometime this year. We haven’t even thought about it,” the chart-topper confessed. “But by the time we throw it, it’ll be old news.

"wedding","2023-07-14","Not Discerned","{""Venice"", ""Veneto"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-20T08:04:49","Hello from my very own sofa, which of course those of you who watched Scotland Sings will be well acquainted with!  So much has happened in the past week since we spoke that I’m having a hard time believing it’s only been seven days.  I very excitedly boarded my flight to Venice from Dallas for the big society wedding we had been invited to.  I can’t remember the last time I was in Venice but I’m thinking it might have been around 45 years ago on a school trip with Ellon Academy. Anyone who was on that Italian school trip please correct me if I’ve got my wires crossed.  I remember St Mark’s Square and the Doge’s Palace from the 70s but not a lot more.  I don’t suppose on a school trip we could have afforded a trip on a gondola and this time around we didn’t feel the need, we just watched other people on theirs. That’s not to say we didn’t spend a lot of time on the canals.  When we landed in Venice we went to find a taxi and realised that wasn’t so easy.  Water taxis were the way to go and being a true Scot I had no intention of paying for a private one if I could pay substantially less for the public one.  Here is a warning, if you ever go to Venice just suck it up and pay the price or you will spend hours on a boat and end up having to drag your cases from where you are dropped off.  On the way back to the airport suffice to say we booked a private water taxi which was expensive but was so enjoyable and just seemed such a fitting way to finish a wonderful trip.  We stood up with the wind in our hair and I sang every Italian song I know as we bumped across the water. I think the boat driver was pretty amused and deafened by the time we got there!  Anyway back to day one! Once we finally arrived at our hotel we didn’t have too much time to chill as the first event of the wedding which was a pre-wedding dinner was that evening.  We were whisked away by water taxi to an incredible venue, to eat fabulous food and drink cocktails.  The great thing about a pre-wedding party is that you get to meet everyone the day before so we spent a lot of time chatting to members of the bride and groom’s families.  I had packed a case for myself and for Gordon before I headed to America to make sure that we had all the outfits for each party with us.  Otherwise the smart velvet jacket that Gordon wore that night would have been forgotten and I couldn’t have trusted him not to turn up in an Arsenal hoodie!  This party went well into the night but like Cinderella on the stroke of midnight we slipped away to the boat as tomorrow was the big day.  As the time for the ceremony approached we were yet again taken in boats down the Grand Canal. The scene was just perfect, like something from a Hollywood movie. And this time I’d packed a dinner suit for Gordon so he looked fabulous.  Chloe Stroll, the bride, is one of my singers. Her manager rang me from New York during Covid and asked if I would take her on.  We did some online lessons in the early days and then eventually started to work regularly in person. It soon became obvious to me that she is special.  Walking down the aisle  Hopefully we will be bringing out her music very soon so I will proudly get to share her with the world.  We have become very close over the past couple of years and when she walked down the aisle with her dad looking exactly like a fairytale princess, I couldn’t hold back the tears.  The groom, Olympic snowboarder Scotty James, was looking every bit her Prince Charming as he waited at the end of the longest aisle I’ve ever seen.  It’s not surprising that the image of Chloe and Scotty walking back down the aisle made the front cover of Italian Vogue.  Day Three dawned and we all congregated for a more relaxed get together although I’m amazed we were all still standing.  What a wonderful weekend was had by all. I was so grateful to be a part of such an event but now I need to sleep for a week.  I did however have the energy for a quick trip to say Happy Birthday to Auntie Agnes!  Have a good week,  Yvie x","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzYW5kam91cm5hbC5jby51ay9mcC9saWZlc3R5bGUvNTc0MTA4Ni95dmllLWJ1cm5ldHQtcm9tYW5jZS1pcy1pbi10aGUtYWlyLWZvci1hLXNvY2lldHktd2VkZGluZy1pbi12ZW5pY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-15","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T07:53:30","By Francis Ewherido  Last Monday was my 24th wedding anniversary. When I went into marriage 24 years ago, it was a mystery. Twenty-four years later, I am not close to unravelling the mystery called marriage. I have gained a lot experience as a participant, a counsellor and an observer, but I remain a student. That is why I am quick to correct anyone who calls me a marriage expert. I acknowledge that I have accumulated a body of knowledge on marriage, but I remain a learner.  Marriage is not an institution where you pound your chest that you have mastered the art. It is an endless sea of water. I see marriage the way I see surfing. Your knowledge of the art and commitment are crucial, but there are other factors outside your control for its success. When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant with the child Jesus, the marriage was effectively over, but for God’s intervention. I sincerely believe in the God factor in the sustenance of marriage. But there are atheist whose marriages lasted for decades till one spouse died, how did such marriages endure? I do not know. But I know that the God factor has helped to keep my marriage alive.  Also, no single spouse can pound his/her chest for the success of his/her marriage because only one spouse cannot make a marriage work, no matter how good he/she is. I met a woman who went into marriage with a firm resolve to make it work. She did everything possible to make her marriage work, but it failed. If your spouse wants out, the marriage is as good as over. That is why everyone whose marriage is still on should stay humble.  You are only one of the contributory factors; you are not all in all. You cannot look down on others whose marriages failed. Even if you are an atheist, you must acknowledge the contribution of your spouse. Without his/her continuous consent, there will be no marriage. When a 99 year old Italian man filed for divorce of his 96-year-old wife of 77 years, the marriage ended. The wife had an affair over 60 years before, but the man only stumbled on the evidence at that time. When he confronted her, she owned up to the affair. Swiftly, the man filed for divorce.  In 1998 the 38 years marriage of Frederik Willem de Klerk (last President of apartheid-era South Africa) to his wife, Marike de Klerk, collapsed due to his infidelity. But former US President, Bill Clinton, committed the same adultery, and his wife, Hilary Clinton, forgave him and the marriage lives on till date. I am just trying to drive home the point that some factors that are responsible for your continued married status are beyond you. Clinton was lucky to escape. Notwithstanding, infidelity remains a major reason for marital breakups.  Money is another major reason why marriages breakup. These days, many girls say on social media that they cannot be in a relationship with a broke man. Money is crucial in marriage, but it is not all in all. The marriage of Bill Gates and Melinda Gates broke up after 27 years together. The same thing happened to Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos after 25 years of marriage. Both men were at different times the richest men in the world. Yet money did not save their marriages. Marriage is a wonderful institution created by God. I cherish it and at the same time look at it with suspicion and trepidation. It can be so slippery. You have to be permanently on the alert. Inertia can lead to doom.  Time has flown by in the last 24 years. It makes me to ask if we have actually lived together for 24 years. Facts do not lie. My first generation of children are in their 20s. They were born after marriage, so we are 24 years old in marriage.  I see marriage as two sides of a coin. The people going into it are good, bad and ugly. They bring all these traits into marriage. A marriage where one or both spouses are totally good is utopian. Such marriages do not exist. Even if they did, I am not sure I will be interested. Conflicts and the unexpected are parts of life and by extension marriage. What is important are mechanisms to resolve conflicts and weather the storm. For me, during conflicts, do not overstep boundaries: I have seen spouses call their other half fool, idiot, agbaya, mumu, short devil and other acidic words. Somehow, they resolve their differences and life goes on. But I am not sure my marriage would endure such acidic words. My wife and I are two strongly opinionated people, so disagreements are inevitable, but knowing each other’s sensitivity, we are careful, but hurtful words, not abuses, do “leak out” sometimes. I know I have said to myself (I dare not say it out because it would make reconciliation more difficult):”wetinsef? Anywhere cloth like, make e tear (let whatever wants to happen, happen). But even as I say it inwardly, I add, “God, na joke I dey o! Forgive me o!”  I do not belong to the school that makes rules that the sun must not set or dawn meets an unresolved disagreement. I am not mechanical. I dey vex my vex complete, then I carry eraser clean am.Married people should not take critical decisions in the heat of anger. Decisions taken in the heat of anger have ended some marriages. Even when there was window to remedy the situation, pride stood in the way. Sometimes pride for spouse when don see you finish nor make sense to me.  While growing up, one of the sayings my mother used to mold us was: “you see, in this life if you look in only one direction, your neck will become stiff, so look in all directions.” This has been very useful to me in marriage and in life generally. If you remember only the good things done for you, you are”eserinone(Someone who remembers only today’s good deeds).My wife does get on my nerves and drives me up the wall sometimes (and vice versa). But I never forget that she has stuck to me through thick and thin, in sickness and in health. I read the story of a marriage which broke up recently. The woman’s only reason was that she was tired of the marriage. I went through the same health challenges as her husband and my wife was a rock all through. When I remember her steadfastness, her faith even when I lost faith and thought I would not pull through, letting go becomes easy. I am not perfect, so I expect no perfection from my wife.  But I still believe forgiveness by spouses should not be taken for granted. Do not cross the red line. That is taking your luck too far. After 24 years, we know the no go areas. They should not be crossed. But every wrongdoing cannot be sacrilege. That is why your core values should be well spelt out at the beginning and in the course of the marriage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3dlZGRpbmctYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktcmVmbGVjdGlvbnMtMy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy52YW5ndWFyZG5nci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS93ZWRkaW5nLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXJlZmxlY3Rpb25zLTMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is a lie that causes many brides-to-be weeks, sometimes months, of unnecessary stress as they try to unearth ‘the one’.  Because there is no one perfect outfit – and it’s time we all admitted it.  As I’m planning a woodland wedding for next June with my partner of ten years, part of the difficulty with finding the one is that our sense of style is forged by opposing forces and, at 30, I’ve got the matriarchs of my family to thank for that.  My nana, 83, is all pea coats, cigarette trousers and dainty cardigans, whereas my mum, 59, honed her style on the streets of London’s Camden and the King’s Road in the 1980s.  It was these two clashing matriarchs I decided to take shopping when I began the search for that elusive, perfect wedding dress.  My nana, 83, is all pea coats, cigarette trousers and dainty cardigans. Pictured: Stephanie and her nana  Stephanie's nana in a tulle dress on her wedding day in 1960. Her nana gave her judgement on the dresses she tried on  If I don't buy this, my mum will  Where? Temperley London, Phoenix Studios, Ilminster, Somerset; temperleylondon.com  Known for romantic styles made using artisanal techniques and featuring intricate details.  I wanted something a little bit different. Temperley’s beautiful, colourful dresses are far from traditional and definitely make a statement.  Nana wanted lace and beads galore, and if there was anywhere she’d find her dream dress it would be here. However, styles with all that detailing are too much for me as they bulk out my curves. Upon seeing the embroidered dress (opposite), she did admit it was ‘very me’.  Dress, £3,200, Temperley London  Mum wanted me to choose this embroidered dress for my big day. It was the only one that got her excited. Part of me thinks if I hadn’t tried it on, she would have.  I discovered that despite really loving this gorgeous dress, I felt worried that it didn’t look ‘bridal’ enough (after all, no one wants to blend in with their wedding guests). Shockingly, my inherited and conflicted style is slowly starting to understand what it wants and, it turns out, much to Nana’s delight, it’s a touch of classic. But where to find it?  'Too busy!' Says Nana  Where? Halfpenny London, 10 Woburn Walk, London WC1; halfpennylondon.com  Known for bold dresses and separates that add drama, plus multiple styling options. Think Brit cool meets playful vintage.  I wanted lots of tulle but with edge to showcase my personality – though nothing too extreme.  Dress, £5,950, Halfpenny London  Corset, £2,495, and skirt, £3,995, Halfpenny London  Nana wanted tulle, too – which she wore for her wedding, aged 21 – but she had strict rules. A tulle shrug was ‘too busy’ but a dress with tulle wing-style shoulders bigger than my head got the thumbs-up. I agreed. It was sleek, flattering and oh so different! I’ll be back to try this one on again.  Mum wanted to go off-piste with Halfpenny’s separates, picking an off-the-shoulder corset top with a densely ruffled skirt (above). I think she was going for a punky Vivienne Westwood vibe.  I discovered that being just five foot two means tulle isn’t always my friend and also that Nana, despite loving pretty details, draws the line at puffball skirts, saying ‘Oh gawd, no!’ when I tried one on.  Sorry, not for me  Where? The Fall, Dalston Works, Ground Floor, 9 Martel Place, London E8; thefallbride.com  Known for its mix of designers offering fresh takes on bridalwear.  I wanted a chance to play with contrasting styles and test what I thought I wanted. Like a veil, which at first I didn’t care for. But when that sheer piece of fabric was placed on my head, I felt like a princess!  Nana wanted a dress decked in intricate lacework or laden with beads. This dress elicited a very passionate response: ‘Now that’s the kind of bride I want my Stephanie to be!’ she bellowed, all teary. I loved how excited she got at finding the dress she wanted me to wear, but the look was not for me.  Dress, £2,150, and skirt, £1,375, Jessica Bennett, and veil, £200, AM Faulkner, from The Fall  Dress, £3,700, Prea James, and veil, £150, AM Faulkner, from The Fall  Mum wanted me to try on a column dress with a huge, detachable skirt and pockets (above) – it was a game-changer. Swishing around with my hands in those pockets I looked like a totally different version of myself.  I discovered you do yourself a disservice when you write off a style of dress without trying it. However, while I loved the column dress I was worried that it would suit a city wedding rather than my woodland one.  Have I found the one?  Where? The Own Studio, 374-378 Old Street, London EC1; theownstudio.com  Known for sleek and minimalist silhouettes.  I wanted a surprise. The Own Studio’s contemporary twist on classics piqued my interest.  Dress, £1,650, and cape, £600, The Own Studio  Nana wanted way more drama! ‘What’s the point in these boring, plain dresses?’ she asked.  Mum wanted to leave – until the stylist pulled out a cape. Paired with a slip dress, it added an ethereal touch that would work perfectly with our woodland wedding. Mum stared at me with a glint in her eyes that said: ‘Could this be the one?’  I discovered that capes aren’t just for superheroes, but brides, too! In fact one may end up being my big-day secret weapon.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA5MTIzMS9Db3VsZC10aHJlZS1nZW5lcmF0aW9ucy1hZ3JlZS1tZWFzdXJlLXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3MuaHRtbNIBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA5MTIzMS9hbXAvQ291bGQtdGhyZWUtZ2VuZXJhdGlvbnMtYWdyZWUtbWVhc3VyZS13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzLmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2017-05-20","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T11:00:00","The Princess of Wales' youngest son Prince Louis is known for his cheeky expressions, but it was her eldest son Prince George who was attracting all the attention at Pippa Middleton's wedding.  The then-three-year-old was a page boy alongside Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire and William Ward, while his younger sister Princess Charlotte, two, was one of four flower girls for Pippa's big day with James Matthews, which took place on 20 May 2017 at St Mark's Church, Englefield. To mark Pippa's sixth wedding anniversary, we've looked back at one funny moment between Kate and her kids which was caught on camera.  © Getty Kate was pictured leading the page boys and flower girls into the church  Before the bride arrived and cameras caught sight of Pippa's stunning lace Giles Deacon wedding dress and handmade Maidenhair Fern tiara, her sister and maid of honour Kate helped shepherd the young bridal party inside the church.  But even the short journey from the car to the doors was enough to catch sight of the Princess' parenting skills as she calmed the children down ahead of the ceremony – a task she had previously admitted worried her.  Dressed in cream shorts and a white collared shirt, Prince George was spotted making his way through the other page boys and flower girls to the front to grab hold of his mother's hand. He then held onto Charlotte, who looked cute in a Pepa & Co white dress with a pink sash, with his other hand. Watch the moment Kate tried to keep the group, led by George, quiet in the video below…  WATCH: Princess Kate shushes Prince George at Pippa Middleton's wedding  At the Queen's garden party just days before the wedding, Kate told one guest that she was ""a bit worried"" about how her children would behave while carrying out their starring roles.  Pippa and James got married on 20 May 2017  Partygoer Andrew Bates said: ""[Kate] said that they were all really looking forward to her sister's wedding at the weekend but she was a bit worried about how her children might behave. She said she was hopeful that they would be good but you never know at that age.""  After the ceremony, Kate's efforts to make sure her children were behaving were visible once again. She followed behind newlyweds Pippa and James down the path while trying to keep hold of Charlotte's hand, but the tot was too engrossed in emptying the petals out of her wicker basket to listen.  © Getty Princess Kate was Pippa's maid of honour  As they gathered outside the church, the Princess crouched down to share a few words with Charlotte before George came wandering over to his mother waving around his basket in the air.  Pippa and James and their guests then headed off for a lavish reception at nearby Englefield House, a romantic Elizabethan manor where movies such as The Kings Speech and 2012's Great Expectations were filmed.  Guests had been asked to bring a change of clothes for the adults-only evening reception, which started at 7.30 pm at Bucklebury Manor. Set on 18 acres, the grade II-listed Georgian house where Carole and Michael Middleton live served as an idyllic backdrop for the reception, which was attended by about 350 guests.

"wedding","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Chelmsford"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T05:00:59","One chaperone service will look after your dog during the ceremony and reception and take it on two walks to 'shake off nerves' during the big day  Gary Jude remembers the first time he photographed a dog at a wedding. It was 2018, in the Essex countryside, and the bride and groom had brought their pet beagle to the reception.  'They were quite outdoorsy people,' he says. 'The dog had on a wax Barbour jacket.' Jude wanted to take group pictures, but the beagle wasn't looking at the camera. 'I had to try to get this dog's attention. I thought, well, I might do what I do with my dogs at home, and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but I went…'  At this point, he takes a deep breath and then makes a string of incomprehensible, high-pitched noises and gurgles. Apparently, the dog loved it.  'He started doing a head tilt and everyone was cracking up.' The 39-year-old wedding photographer might have been 'in a room of 50 people that I'd never met and doing stupid baby dog talking', but he enjoyed himself nonetheless. 'I'm a massive dog person.'  These days, canine-friendly weddings are big business. More venues let dogs attend ceremonies and receptions  Lucky for him, then: last year Jude photographed 40 dogs at one wedding.  The bride and groom had rented a field in North Devon and let guests bring their pets. 'There were dogs running around everywhere,' says Jude.  'I was in my element.' Still, the pet-positive day was not without its issues. Halfway through the groom's speech, one of the hounds cocked his leg against a table in the marquee. Luckily, the bride was fixed on the groom and didn't notice.  These days, canine-friendly weddings are big business. More venues let dogs attend ceremonies and receptions; wedding photographers have dedicated 'dog' sections on their websites, and dog groomers offer pre-wedding pooch pampering.  Smarty Paws, in Nottingham, sells a gold package from £250: dogs have their fur clipped, nails trimmed, ears cleaned and, according to the website, 'cologne applied, if you wish'. (Jude, for what it's worth, didn't have dogs at his own wedding because it was 2013 and the venue didn't allow it.  He was, however, permitted to have a trained barn owl called Rosie swoop down the aisle and deliver the wedding rings – swings and roundabouts.)  In 2018, professional dog trainer Lizzie Benge set up Here Comes The Hound, a chaperone service for dogs at weddings.  Benge, 39, is based in Kent, but she and her business partner Claire travel around the country to work the wedding canine circuit. Their services aren't cheap: a full-day package costs £550.  So what do you get for your money? First, Benge offers a pre-wedding 'consultation' with the bride, groom and dog, to get to know the animal and find out what the couple want.  On the wedding day, Benge will look after the dog throughout the ceremony and reception, drive it between venues, get it to cooperate during photos and take it on two walks  Then, on the wedding day, she will look after the dog throughout the ceremony and reception, drive it between venues, get it to cooperate during photos, and give it two hour-long walks – one in the morning and one in the afternoon – 'to shake off the big-day nerves'.  She also can, if requested, release the dog down the church aisle with the wedding rings attached to its neck.  And, for an extra £100, there's an overnight service, 'including sofa cuddles, yummy dinner, sleepover fun, a morning-after 90-minute walk and taxi back home or to the honeymoon holiday home'. Last year,  Benge worked at 16 weddings; she promises all the dogs behaved immaculately.  Naturally, I have a lot of questions. How does Benge get the dogs to behave for photographs? 'We come armed with squeaky toys, balls and treats.'  How many dogs can she look after in one go? It depends on how big and well behaved they are; she once chaperoned three labradors, with the aid of a colleague.  Which breed is the most popular? 'Cockapoos are everywhere. Or some variation on poo: cavapoo, shih-poo.' Are there any breeds she hates working with?  'I would never say no to any type of dog,' she says, diplomatically, before adding:  'I wouldn't particularly want to work with chihuahuas. Only because they're normally quite nervous. People want them in their day, but I'm not really sure that chihuahuas want to be a part of their day.'  I WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK WITH CHIHUAHUAS – THEY'RE NERVOUS  And the biggest questions of all: why would someone want their dog at their wedding? And why would they pay north of £500 to do it?  Lockdown, probably. If the country was already dog mad, spending endless hours trapped with our dogs has only made us dog madder.  Between March and September 2020, 2.2 million dogs were bought in the UK; by 2021, Britain's canine population had risen by more than ten per cent. And, thanks to working from home, so many of those lockdown puppies grew up never being on their own.  'It's a double-edged sword,' says Benge. 'I think it's lovely that people care so much about their dogs. But I also believe that, from the animals' point of view, they need to learn to be left by themselves.'  Still, your wedding isn't an ordinary day, and, if you want your pet there, you may as well do it in style.  That said, there are some animals that Benge thinks are best left at home – wedding day or not. When I ask if she would consider expanding business to chaperoning cats any earlier displays of diplomacy are abandoned.  'No!' says Benge, laughing. 'I just don't think that's a good idea.'

White is a popular colour for brides to wear and it is important that the bride stands out on her wedding day.  1 A bride has revealed how her friend wore white lace to her wedding Credit: Reddit  Regularly a guest wearing white can be seen as an attempt to upstage the bride, the same rule applies to wearing white lace too.  So unless the bride and groom have specifically requested for guests to wear the colour, it is best to avoid.  But for one bride, she was left in shock after her guest decided to wear a white lace dress to her wedding.  In a post on Reddit, she shared a picture of the guest and said: ""My tenth wedding anniversary is approaching, and as I was going through photos, I stumbled across this one of one of my husband's groomsmen and his wife, who wore a literal white lace dress to our wedding.  “To be fair, it was incredibly, incredibly short and very, very tight, so I'm not sure anyone mistook her for 'the bride,' but it was… something.""  This left many Reddit users stunned, and some even rushed to the comments section to share their thoughts.  Some even admitted they mistook the woman for the bride.  One wrote: ""Sometimes I think people are too strict about the white rule, but holy hell, if you told me that was YOU in your wedding dress I would have believed you. It's even lacy!!!!""  A second replied: ""There is no such thing as too strict. There are millions of colors. Pick any of them but white. Too strict would be banning white dress shirts.""  Someone else added: ""Yes, I'm the same. Sometimes I'm like 'nah that's fine, or mother of the brides are fine,' but this dress is absolutely ridiculous for a wedding guest.

The beef, chicken, or fish-plated dinners have gone by the wayside in favor of non-traditional options like a taco food trucks or pasta bars. But surely the crown jewel of the wedding dining experience, the wedding cake, will endure the test of time, right? It seems less and less likely over time as folks reject many of the nuptial rituals and look for customized dessert menus.  Engaged couples are also likely to reject wedding cakes because they are astronomically expensive, costing $350 on average, says Brides. And the tiered masterpieces that have been a staple in weddings also have a reputation for being a tad flavorless and boring, not to mention generic. For a while, that meant the soon-to-be-wed would go for modern cake styles, favoring bold floral decorations, distinctive techniques like stucco frosting, and unique flavors such as pumpkin spice latte cake with cream cheese frosting. Now those are very common and read as just as nondescript as their predecessors. And as the general trend in weddings is that most couples want each aspect of the wedding to be catered to their unique tastes and interests, the traditional wedding cake is out in favor of more quirky, memorable dessert options.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTI4NzU3OC9sZXRzLWhvbmVzdC13ZWRkaW5nLWNha2VzLW92ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-05-20","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T15:32:36","A group of Cape Hatteras Elementary third-grade students made a remarkable and unexpected discovery of a 17th-century wedding ring while on a field trip to the new Lost Colony Museum and Gift Shop in Buxton.  Scott Dawson, museum owner and author of The Lost Colony and Hatteras Island, engaged the 18 students and their teacher Jordyn Fenner with a few interactive activities during their visit, and that included an opportunity to sift through some of the residue of previous archaeological digs from a site in Buxton.  “When we do archaeology in the field, we get the big artifacts, and we catch the really small stuff through a mosquito screen so we can sift through it later,” said Dawson.  Archaeological digs have been conducted several times a year at an undisclosed Buxton site since 2009, under the guidance of renowned experts from around the globe.  The timeframe of the artifacts is determined by the layer of subterranean turf where they are found, and the bucket of small pieces that the students sifted through was from the 1610s-1640s.  Among the tiny animal teeth and fish vertebrae, the students discovered a few new treasures.  “They ended up finding a musket ball, and a blue Venetian bead, and a piece of silver which we think is part of a wedding ring,” said Dawson. “It’s not unusual to find a musket ball or a bead, but a wedding ring is something else entirely.”  The small half-sliver of metal had a portion of a setting intact, and while Dawson recognized the find as a rare ring, he contacted Professor Mark Horton of England’s University of Bristol – one of the top archaeologists in the world – to confirm the discovery. “He wrote back and said ‘I think it could be a ring’… It’s sterling silver, and that’s not something that’s Native American,” said Dawson.  “The kids took [the project] very seriously, so it’s exciting that they found something so unusual.”  The Lost Colony Museum officially launched in the spring of 2023 as an initiative to share Hatteras Island’s distinctive place in the familiar story of the early English colonists.  Filled with hundreds of artifacts, documents, and interactive displays that share insights from global experts, the museum uncovers the major role that Hatteras Island and the original Croatoans had in the English’s initial visits and later colonization of America.  “We should be more famous than Plymouth Rock,” said Dawson. “We are Manteo’s hometown. So we’re trying to be a little more inclusive, and to tell the story from a new, native perspective.”  The museum also aims to erase a decades-old myth that no one knows what happened to the Lost Colonists of Roanoke Island, who disappeared in 1587 after carving the word “CROATOAN” into a palisade – an indication that they were heading south to Hatteras Island.  Per Dawson, there were multiple English journeys to the Outer Banks prior to the Lost Colony, with the first English visitors landing in modern-day Buxton in 1584. Manteo was actually from Hatteras Island, and instead of warring with the colonists, Manteo served as an ambassador, making two trips across the pond to build relationships with the new English arrivals, and earning a Lordship in the process.  “The English made multiple journeys to Hatteras Island before [the Lost Colony], so having a story where we don’t talk about what happened in 1584, 1585, and 1586 is like telling the story about the Titanic, but leaving out the iceberg,” said Dawson. “People would wonder how the Titanic sank, and would debate how it [disappeared], but it’s a fact that we already know.”  Since opening, the museum has continually expanded, with a new display case arriving soon, and donations being collected for a second display case to showcase the many local artifacts. “It’s a good problem to have when you have so many artifacts that you need two cases,” said Dawson.  And while the CHES third grade class was the very first school group to visit the museum – making a remarkable discovery to boot in the process – Dawson hopes that they won’t be the last.  “I would like for all the Dare County Schools, and any school really, to come and visit, but especially our Hatteras Island [students],” said Dawson. “This is their heritage, and if they come away knowing a little bit more about how important Hatteras Island and the Croatoans were in history, it is very much worth it.”  For more information, and how you can help:","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL2lzbGFuZGZyZWVwcmVzcy5vcmcvaGF0dGVyYXMtaXNsYW5kLWZlYXR1cmVzL2NhcGUtaGF0dGVyYXMtc3R1ZGVudHMtZGlzY292ZXItYS0xN3RoLWNlbnR1cnktd2VkZGluZy1yaW5nLXdoaWxlLXZpc2l0aW5nLXRoZS1uZXctbG9zdC1jb2xvbnktbXVzZXVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T06:34:49","By Josh Katzowitz, WCI Content Director  Need to get caught up on the first two parts of our From Fourth Year to the Real World series? Here’s part 1 which introduces the ones we follow and part 2 which tells the tale of them transitioning from medical school to residency.  In the months before their friends and family joined together to raise a toast in appreciation and optimism, Ariel was super stressed about the party that was to celebrate the marriage between her and Danny.  It was her intern year, so her medical training was already intense and sometimes overwhelming, and the couple owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in combined student loan debt. Ariel’s father had agreed to pay for their April 2023 wedding celebration, but she was mostly the one to plan it and to try to keep it within the $80,000 budget.  Ariel felt herself in a downward spiral, caused by the stress of the party, the steep learning curve of her intern year, and the guilt that her retired father was the one paying the bills.  “It was horrible,” Ariel said. “The crux of the problem was the financial stress on my dad. Knowing he could handle it but still feeling bad and burdening him with such a large amount of money in such a short amount of time. I went to therapy every week in that two- or three-month time frame.”  Growing up, Ariel didn’t care about having such a grand wedding, but when her wealthy father a year earlier had given her a choice between him paying off the remainder of her medical school loans (about $90,000 worth) or an extravagant wedding, she chose the latter. In the leadup to it, she began having doubts.  “I thought it was such a waste of money,” she said. “If he had paid for school, even if it was $20,000-$30,000 more, I would have been fine with it.”  Ava and Patrick also had separate awakenings this year. In the month leading up to her intern year in 2022, Ava, even with a new job and impending imposter syndrome on the horizon, was calm. You could have even described her as “chill.” A year later, Ava can’t believe how naïve she had been.  Meanwhile, a year ago, Patrick’s wife had just welcomed their third child into the family, and with an enormous amount of student loan debt, a new house in a new part of the country, and a $14,000 IRS refund check that seemed to be lost in the mail, his life was full of stress—and this was even before he started his new job. Now, even with a fourth child on the way, Patrick has never been more comfortable with his financial standing and what he sees as his family’s future.  In the time since WCI last caught up with the four medical-students-turned-interns, they’ve all made incredible strides in their lives, in their careers, and in their finances. Their attitudes, though, run the gamut from unprecedented comfort to unyielding burnout. For all of these interns, the last year has been filled with bumps and bruises, and yet, all of them have survived their first year of residency intact. They can all smile about it now.  The First Year of Residency  In February 2022, we started a new series called From Fourth Year to the Real World where I write about a quartet of graduating medical students who have begun their residencies.  Since they’re completely transparent with how much they owe and how much they make—and with how they’re mapping out their financial futures—we aren’t using their real names. We check in with these newly minted doctors occasionally, and today, they’re reminiscing on their intern years and how they utilized their new resident’s salaries while, in their own words, they began learning how to adult.  Here’s a quick introduction to the ones we follow:  Ariel and Danny: This newly married couple owe close to $400,000 in student loans, and they’ve just officially joined their lives (if not their financial accounts) together in matrimony. They earn about $100,000 together, and they’ve come through a stressful year while maintaining their individuality.  Ava: For the first time in her life, Ava made a solid salary (she earned $60,000 as an intern, and that will bump up to $65,000 in her second year), but she’s learned plenty about herself in the past 12 months. She’s not a big spender, and the new money was nice, particularly since she doesn't have any student loan debt. But she also nearly burned herself out during her intern year.  Patrick: He won’t become an attending until he’s in his mid-30s, and Patrick owes nearly $500,000 in medical school loans. Patrick will soon be a father of four boys, and he juggles his parental responsibilities with his wife, Brittany, who makes more money than him as a nurse.  Ariel and Danny Bonded Together While Maintaining Some Separation  There’s little doubt that Ariel and Danny are comfortable with their new financial status. She’s enjoying her annual pass to one of the country’s top-notch amusement parks, and Danny bought season tickets to the local major college football program. They sit together on the couch of their $1,900-per-month apartment on this day, and they look at ease. They have jobs. They have friends. They can do what they want when they want because they have money and because they’re not currently having to pay off student loan debt.  They’re married, so they’re bonded together. But they’ve maintained separate accounts. No joint checking, no joint savings, no joint brokerage account. One pays for groceries, and the other reimburses them through Zelle.  There have been discussions about possibly opening an account to which they both have access, especially now that they received $13,000 in wedding gifts (at the moment, that total is in Ariel’s account). But they eat separate dinners—Ariel will make a big batch of chicken that she then can use for lunch over the next few days; Danny is more content with a ground beef offering that he might scarf down all at once. And their money is isolated as well.  “Having checks with the same name, that would be nice,” Danny thought aloud. Said Ariel: “My aunts and uncles think it’s strange. But we have different habits. I’m not bothered by his. He’s not bothered by mine. We make the same amount of money. We just don’t need to put it in the same pile.”  Maybe the decision to keep their finances separate is generational. Born in the mid-1990s, they’re among the youngest millennials, and perhaps that generation is more apt to remain financially independent from their spouse. Or maybe it has something to do with how they were raised.  Danny’s father was a truck driver—he’s still working in his mid-60s on overnight shifts—and his mom was a stay-at-home spouse before finding work as a grocery store cashier. His family didn’t have wealth. Danny worked while he was in college, and he lived at home to save money. He comes from a blue-collar upbringing.  Ariel’s father, meanwhile, was rich.  Danny made it clear before they were married that his student loan debt was his alone. He didn’t want Ariel’s money (or, indirectly, her father’s wealth) to pay off what he owed. Even though they both make the same amount of money as residents (together, they earned $98,000 as interns), they are simply more comfortable with this setup.  How and when to pay off those student loans is still a question. Thanks to the federal government’s student loan holiday and the frozen interest rates, Danny has been making $0 payments. When student loan payments resume, potentially later in 2023, he figures he’ll pay about $370 per month. He’s considering trying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. It might not be worth it for Ariel since she’s only in a three-year residency and might not want to work for the government or a nonprofit. But Danny’s residency is a year longer, and he might add on a fellowship that could take him 50%-60% of the way toward PSLF and getting his loans forgiven 10 years after he graduates from medical school.  Otherwise, the two are secure. Ariel is budgeting (and up until the wedding, she was actually sticking with it), but they’re not aggressively saving. They’re contributing to their 401(a) retirement plans—unfortunately, they’re not getting a match from their employer—and they’re contemplating opening Roth IRAs.  “I have a cushion now,” Danny said. “If anything comes up, we can afford it. If the car goes out, we can afford it.” “And we have that $13,000,” Ariel reminded.  The two have newfound financial freedom, and they don’t have to answer to anybody (not even each other). They’re joined together in matrimony, and they have separate accounts. They’ve worked hard, and they’re not necessarily looking to skimp.  “I hear all the attendings say that we’re going to be a two-physician household,” Ariel said. “It’s like, ‘Let’s just spend the money now.’”  In a Better Spot Than Ever Before  Spending money now? Yes, Patrick knows a little something about that.  Though Patrick and his wife Brittany have maintained an emergency fund of at least $5,000 in his first year of residency, the costs continue to get more intense. Patrick grew up in a household that was always worried about money (he heard his father vomiting from stress in the middle of the night, and if he would have asked his dad for a snack at a gas station, “there was no way in hell that was going to happen”).  But now, he can realistically say that he’s in a more comfortable financial spot than ever before.  Patrick earned $58,500 last year (that’ll increase to $64,000 for second year), and—thanks to her full-time salary, her signing bonus, and her moving stipend—Brittany made about six figures at her nursing job in the past year. Yes, their student loan debt of $460,000 is still sitting there untouched, but Patrick hasn’t felt pinched by paying their bills and splurging on the occasional vacation.  As he’s talking, his second-oldest child is playing with the remote control to the ceiling fan, popping his head in and out of view of the computer’s camera. Patrick is working nights this week, so he’s taking care of his two youngest kids. But childcare is still expensive, and it’s about to cost the family even more when Brittany has their fourth child and transitions to part-time work in the next several months.  Their oldest child is in kindergarten, and though there’s a childcare center right in their neighborhood, that convenience costs $3,000 per month. They’ve eschewed that and instead pay a babysitter $20 per hour for two of the kids and $25 if she’s watching all three. That costs them $300 per week, but even more stressful is the fact that they’ve already burned through a few babysitters this year until they found the right fit.  Patrick figures he averages fewer than five hours of sleep per night with Brittany getting even less. When she’s on an overnight nursing shift, she gets home at about 8am, falls asleep by 9, and then awakens at 2pm to pick up the oldest from kindergarten.  Stress, exhaustion, and burnout? Yes, Patrick and Brittany know a little something about that.  “We are burnt out,” Patrick said. “It’s not sustainable any longer.”  Patrick, though, remains appreciative and optimistic.  Although the family will lose some of her salary when Brittany transitions to part-time work, Patrick plans to moonlight as much as possible a year from now when third year begins. If he covers one inpatient unit for the weekend, he can make $2,000. Do that a couple of times per month, and he’s suddenly replaced Brittany’s income (and maybe she can even stop working altogether). Plus, when he’s a third-year, he can arrive at work an hour early and make $160 to see a new patient or $80 to follow up with one who’s already established. He can stay two extra hours after his shift and earn the same money. He can eventually conduct ED admissions while working from home and make $115 per hour through the wonders of telehealth.  “Once third year rolls around, I’d be fine working from 7am to 8pm if I need to 2-3 days a week and do 2-3 weekends a month,” Patrick said. “If my wife is still working, we’d have more than enough money. But it has not been nearly as stressful as I anticipated it would be. We have that surety of a stable income.”  But what about his loans? For now, it’s all in deferment, but he’ll likely try for PSLF eventually. While he’s in residency and a possible fellowship, he figures he’ll end up paying close to $9,000 a year. By the time he can apply for PSLF, he’s hoping about $240,000 would be forgiven.  “It’s not scaring me nearly as bad it was before,” he said. “Before, it was this huge number; how can I attack it? But once you get looking at the attending salaries, you realize that as long as I don’t upgrade my life extravagantly, I could pay this off pretty reasonably within 5-10 years. I’ll finish residency at 36, so I’d be in my 40s when I pay them off. I’d probably be getting greedy; I’d want a nicer house and a Tesla. But it’s those extravagant wants that you need to check.”  Growing up, his parents worried about where the next paycheck was coming from, and no matter how hard they worked, they didn’t have much earning potential. They didn't have much room to breathe. Patrick has a different mindset.  No. 1, he’s not scared of intense labor. In college, he worked at a moving company, and sometimes he put in 80-90 hours per week of schlepping furniture around. No. 2, he knows that in a few years, he’ll be earning hundreds of thousands of dollars.  That’s why his future is so freeing.  “We still have to exercise some restraint,” Patrick said. “There are things we want that we’re not getting right now. But that’s different than saying, ‘Shoot, the credit card bill is running up. We have to pay for this soon, but we don’t have the money.’ That’s a different feeling than us saying, ‘Oh, we can’t buy a hot tub yet.’”  Patrick and Brittany have never been at a point where they have this little amount of financial stress. But a new baby is coming. The mortgage on their 1,800-square foot house still needs to be paid. Diapers and baby wipes could be as much as $200 a month. Baby formula is astronomical.  Yes, Patrick, who knows residents who can earn up to $200,000 of extra income, has grand plans to moonlight as much as possible by the fall of 2024. But the specter of true physician burnout is never far away; it can still pop in and out of view before you realize what's happening. Patrick still needs to figure out a way to make space in his life to relax and spend time with his growing family. He still needs to figure out a way to breathe.  What Ava Didn’t Know About Life and Medicine  When looking back at her first year of residency, Ava takes in a deep breath, reminisces about her mindset only 11 months earlier, and exhales in wonder at how little she knew about what was to happen.  Ava was supposed to move into a newly built apartment only a few days before she started her first rotation of intern year. She was fine with that. But the move-in date kept getting pushed back, and eventually, she realized that she was going to be homeless unless she acted soon. With a week to go before she started her neuro-radiology rotation, she began frantically searching for another apartment to sublet.  The stress of her intern year never subsided.  “I was,” Ava says now, “a little bit naïve.”  Ava grew up as a world traveler, living in wealthy countries like Oman and the UAE and in poorer areas in Bolivia and Venezuela. Her family avoided a lifestyle of big spending and they saved their money, habits that have followed Ava into her mid-20s. She’s in a better financial position than most, because thanks to a half-scholarship to medical school and her parents’ willingness to cover the rest of her tuition and living expenses, she has no student loan debt.  Her parents didn’t teach her much about money, but she is still utilizing their indirect lessons on saving. She’s putting 5% of her salary into her Roth 401(k), and she gets a match from her employer. One paycheck a month goes toward paying her rent. The other is hers to spend and save. She likes seeing at least $5,000 in her checking account, so even though she might occasionally buy a $300 dress or spend $200 on a haircut, she’s still driving the same 2016 Volkswagen she’s owned since college. She’s also never had to ask her parents for money, and for that, she feels proud.  Those relatively sparse spending habits allowed her to buy a $2,000 plane ticket so she could spend a month in her native Argentina in 2022. She’s going to Mexico on vacation soon, and when we spoke, she was in the process of planning a trip to Portugal —after her $1,600 plane ticket, she’s budgeted $2,000 for two weeks as Ava and two of her pals drive the Iberian peninsula coast while avoiding fancy hotels and dinners.  “I’m not a big spender,” she said. “I’ve never had a big budget to spend. And if I’m working 12 hours a day on six-day work weeks, I don’t have time. That’s been helpful, too.”  Well, that intense workflow has been helpful in some ways. In other ways, though, it’s forced Ava to reckon with her work-life balance and how to navigate her intern-year burnout.  “I didn’t realize how sheltered I was in medical school,” she said. “Medicine is really glorified in medical school, and you start residency and you think, ‘This isn’t as magical as I thought it was going to be.’”  This year, Ava has learned about the failures of the healthcare system; how some people don’t have access to care; the insurance costs of medicine; and how difficult it is to find, build, and sustain relationships when you’re not working. She learned a $3,000 mistake when she went to an urgent care this year for help with a gastric ulcer. She was shucked into the real world without an apartment, where she’d work long hours and then collapse into bed after she got home. Her one-year relationship with a boyfriend fell apart.  At the same time, she likes residency more than she enjoyed medical school. She’s made connections with patients. She’s been motivated by them. She’s felt rewarded by them.  “You have this incredible opportunity to be by people’s side at their most vulnerable,” Ava said. “It’s incredibly rewarding. That’s what has kept me motivated.”  Like all the fourth years who have now spent a year in the real world, Ava has grown as a doctor and learned more about herself as a person. She and Patrick battled through burnout. Ariel sought weekly therapy. Danny had to reckon with the economic help he received from his father-in-law.  They’ve all lived to talk about it, and their transformation as doctors and as people since the last time we caught up with them is striking.  They’ve got money in the bank. They can enjoy their lives away from work, or they’re trying their best to learn how. They’re appreciative and optimistic, and they’re grateful that the journey —and all of the unforeseen barriers that are sure to keep coming their way —will continue.  Make sure to get caught up on part 1 and part 2 of our From Fourth Year to the Real World series.

Following months of PDA-filled red carpets, Fox sparked split rumors in February when she deleted all photos of her with MGK on her social media and cryptically captioned a slideshow, “You can taste the dishonesty/ it’s all over your breath.”  The couple started dating in early 2020. machinegunkelly/Instagram  The “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” star then took off her engagement ring shortly after.

They had previously advertised the wedding on social media, including the date, and we wondered if we would be invited. We weren’t, which was totally fine because of our limited budget.  Then, two weeks before the wedding date, we received an email inviting us to watch it virtually. We already had plans that night, but because we care for this family, we tried to bend things so we could watch it. Unfortunately, the video feed for the reception was all goofed up. We couldn’t really see it, and then we just got a replay reel at the end.  What would you say the suggested gift amount is in that situation?

I have been assured that I have met these ladies, but that I was “just a baby” at the time.  I have been blessed with two children in the last two years, and these kind ladies give my mother presents for my children. My mom brings some present from them practically every other week.  Some presents become a beloved favorite toy, while others miss the mark. That’s to be expected of gifts from strangers. My mom then urges me to write thank-you notes to her friends.  These are unsolicited gifts from strangers. I have two young children and I do not have the time to sit down and write thank-you notes to people I don’t know.  I feel that these gifts are actually meant for the grandmother to give the grandchild — not for the mother and the child, with the grandmother acting as a delivery service. Thus, I feel that if my mom wants them to receive a thank-you note, she should be the one to write it.  GENTLE READER: Has it become so commonplace to explicitly solicit presents that we have become resentful when people give them spontaneously — and for the sheer pleasure of it?  Never mind; Miss Manners knows the answer all too well.  Yes, these inconsiderate strangers are using your children as a conduit for expressing their affection for your mother. How rude.  If you really want the presents to stop, by all means, make your mother look bad and cease writing thank-you letters. But know that since the relative success rate of these presents is fairly high (although it should not matter), you will also be punishing your children.  The good news is that if you just hold out a couple more years, your children will be old enough to write the letters themselves. Then you can have the pleasure of nagging them.

"wedding","2023-05-20","16:00:00","{""Redding"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:27:02","A beautiful wedding at Meadowbrook Ranch last Saturday when Taylor Collins and Chase Bunn were married. For years I have driven past the bronze bucking horse statue as we drove to and from our Susanville ranch when the cattle were shipped to the mountains. This was the first time to be on the ranch, and it was amazing. It is much larger than what we see from Highway 36E as we drive up the hill. We were at the far eastern end of the meadow with a creek flowing past, and Angus cattle grazing in a pasture to the south of where the wedding was held. Across the creek were beautiful bluffs rising to the north.  It was an outdoor wedding, and the sun was hot at 4 p.m. but it wasn’t raining like the previous week when we were at the Junior Livestock Auction.  Years ago I attended a wedding when the bride arrived in a horse drawn carriage, however Taylor arrived in a viper red Peterbilt 389 with brushed black strips, powered by a high-torque X15 hooked to an 18-speed, a 280 inch wheelbase, and it lowered when stopped. The truck license plate was ‘Mrs Cone.’ Bruce and Kellie Cone of Cone Trucking, Redding, had loaned Mike Collins the beautiful truck for the wedding. Their arrival had a rhythmic sound coming from the truck. It was awesome!  For newcomers to Tehama County, grandfather Mike Collins has a truck and has hauled livestock across the nation, as well as known for the delicious meals at many brandings and social functions. Mike and Teri also have a fence building company as does the groom.  When we arrived, the guestbook on table was near a stock trailer where gifts were placed. Then we were asked to sign a cloth square for a quilt that will be made.  The officiants of the wedding ceremony were JB Stacy and James Miller. Best man was Garret Boyd, with groomsmen Jack Simonis, Jake Cunningham, Ben Urricelqui, Kent Johnson, and Zack Cunningham.  Ring bearers in white shirt, red suspenders and Levis were Meyer Cunningham and Ayker Fitze.  Maid of Honor was Sami Stabile and Matron of Honor was Alek Fitze. Bridesmaids in burgundy gowns were Kilee Birt, Macey Bunn, Madison Waelty and Courtny Grames.  Three little girls in white dresses were the flower girls. The tiniest was Stevi Birt, daughter of Brian and Lynsie Collins Birt, with Quincy and Karsyn Cunningham, cousins of the groom.  Taylor is the daughter of Jenifer and Bryon Waelty. She has been a Chamber Ambassador and I see her at Good Morning Red Bluff each month. She works at Summit Funding.  Chase is son of Wade and Gwen Bunn, and has Bunn Fencing.  There were many children at the wedding and there was a Bounce House for them to enjoy, while we enjoyed beverages or bottled water in the shade.  When Linda Walker and I started to bring our chairs over to the shade. James Boyd rescued us and carried the chairs.  Our table was near the dance floor and bridal table, where I had an opportunity to visit with Mike’s 93-year-old aunt Joy White from Yuma, Arizona. Guests at the wedding had also come from Florida, Oklahoma, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho and multiple other states.  Mike’s kitchen crew prepared the delicious beef dinner. Taylor and Chase greeted each guest as they handed the dinner plates to usWhat a clever idea, to be able to greet everyone and we could say “Congratulations” to them!  It was a beautiful wedding.  Teri Collins used social media to express her thoughts and say thank you.  “”The Lord saw fit to bless us in so many ways, that we would like to take the opportunity to Thank some of the most amazing people for helping bring Taylor & Chase Bunn’s day from a drawing on paper to reality….to the cooking crew that kept their promise to Taylor for keeping Mike out of an apron: Tony & Linette, Casey & Clint aka Big Fella, Larry & Dolores, John & Candie, Greg & Jenny, Roy & Casey, Alex, Katlin, Amy, Nichole, Felicia & John. Last but not least, Lee Shope for everything he did the whole week before the big day. The Cline family for giving us one of the most beautiful places in Red Bluff to celebrate a dream come true. Thank you Brian Birt for doing everything you could to bring Taylor’s day full circle. Thank you to Shanna & Dusty deBraga for sharing your wonderful table tops, bridal party table & bar. Kellie & Bruce Cone for sharing such an amazing work of art, Clifford, the Red Truck. We are truly Blessed to have such amazing people in our lives. Being able to share this day with so many wonderful friends & family from Nevada, Oklahoma, Colorado, Oregon, and places that I probably don’t even know about, not to mention all those friends & family right here in California is truly a blessing. From ages, 93 to just a few months old. The weather started out a bit warm, but ended amazing. A big shout out to Scott Stabile, Merak & a buddy for picking up the chairs before they left for the night. With all that said, I hope I didn’t hurt any feelings for forgetting them.

"wedding","1921-01-24","Not Discerned","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:05:30","Doug Stout  Guest Columnist  On June 17, 1919, First Lieutenant Frederick Fleek Wright boarded the U.S.S. Antigone at the port of St. Nazaire, France for his return to the United States. He arrived in New York on June 28. On July 29, he received his discharge from the Army and returned to his job at the First National Bank in Newark.  On Monday evening, Jan. 24, 1921, Frederick married Mary Elizabeth Carl at the Second Presbyterian Church in Newark. “The bride,” according to The Newark Advocate, “is the only daughter of Mr. Louis F. Carl of West Church Street. She was a student at Ward Belmont school [in] Nashville, Tennessee.”  Mary’s mother, Fannie, had passed away but was from a well-known family in Newark. Fannie was born in Newark in 1866 to Eli and Jemima Hull. Eli became a major developer in Newark. She had a much older brother who was a minister, and a younger sister that the Hulls had adopted, Laura Mae. Laura married William Wehrle, the cofounder of the Wehrle Stove Company.  In 1888, Fannie married Louis Carl. Louis was employed by the Logan Gas Company and eventually became the head of that business. Mary was born in 1898, their only child.  Tragedy struck the family 10 years later when they were living at 116 West Church Street. Fannie was raking and burning leaves in the yard when her dress caught fire. She was severely burned and died of her injuries on Dec. 17, 1908, just two days before her 20th wedding anniversary. According to family historian Gill Miller, “Little Mary was, of course, in the custody of her father, but was cared for by mother’s sister, ‘Aunt Laura Wehrle,’ who had had only one child who died immediately post-birth in 1905.”  But Mary and Frederick's wedding day in 1921 was a happy one, according to the article that covered the prestigious families in the social column of The Advocate.  The colors for the wedding were described as a “deftly harmonizing rainbow” with “colors [of] green, gold and lavender. The altar was banked with a profusion of gorgeous palms and ferns, while large garlands of southern smilax were used in every available space. Loops of the smilax caught on the pews outlining the aisles. In the bower of greenery on the altar, candlelight glowed from numerous tall silver candle sticks. The bridal gown was of white chiffon velvet, fashioned with the short skirt and [a] full-length panel train that was caught at the shoulders. The only trimming was a touch of real lace. A great shower of a bouquet of orchids, lilies of the valley, and white sweet peas completed the costume.”  The family names mentioned in the column were a veritable who’s who of Licking County at the time.  The newlyweds left for the East Coast and took a ship to Europe. According to their passport application, the couple planned to return in about six months. They listed the countries that they wanted to see as Italy, Spain, Greece and France. Turkey was also listed but appears to have been crossed out.  The trip seems to have been successful. In March of 1922, the Wrights presented a program to the “Monday Talks” club at the library where Frederick was to present on, “The Mediterranean Trip,” while Mary provided “musical selections.”  The trip also produced a son, Frederick Wehrle Wright. He was born in Newark on Dec. 3, 1921. Unbeknownst to the family, “Little Frederick,” as he was known, would be the next soldier in the family.

"wedding","2023-05-18","15:00:00","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T09:24:00","CLEVELAND, Ohio – I received this letter from Steve (not his real name):  “We have been planning my youngest daughter’s wedding for the past year. A month before the wedding – on the plane home from her bachelorette party – she received a text message from a woman informing her that her fiancé has been cheating on her. Wedding canceled.  “My daughter’s heart is broken in half. Our family devastated. Her friends devastated. Wedding guests informed. Thousands of dollars in wedding expenses non-refundable. There are worse things, but this is hard. We will support and love our daughter to get through it.”  As I read Steve’s email, my first thought was, “Was the woman who texted the report of cheating telling the truth?”  I emailed Steve for more information. He wrote:  “The text was from the woman my daughter’s fiancé cheated with. We have since found out she contacted my daughter because she was trying to ‘do the right thing.’ The fiance’ told her his real name, so she curiously looked looked him up on Facebook and saw he was engaged to my daughter.”  THE COST OF A WEDDING  I called Reverend John Lentz of Forest Hill Presbyterian Church in Cleveland Heights, and read him Steve’s emails.  “My heart breaks for her and her father,” said Lentz. “They obviously did the right thing calling it off. That can be hard, because some of these elaborate weddings are planned two years in advance. It’s a huge industry and can be very expensive.”  Canceling a wedding can lead to embarrassment and a financial loss, even if it’s for all the right reasons.  A story by cleveland.com’s Jane Morice states the average cost of a wedding nationally is $30,000. In Ohio, it’s $26,000.  Lentz insists meeting with couples for counseling before he marries them. A few times, it was clear one of the people had substance-abuse problems.  “I refused to do the wedding,” he said. “I pushed for the person to go into counseling.”  Some of the couples didn’t get married. A few did, and it was disaster.  IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA OF A WEDDING  “There’s no such thing as a perfect couple,” Lentz said. “But there are obvious warning signs, and too often people ignore them. When there is physical, substance and other forms of abuse, you can’t go through with the with wedding.”  Steve’s daughter was already sharing an apartment with her supposed husband-to-be. They were splitting the rent. She convinced him to move out, and now she pays the rent. The temptation would be to get married anyway, or at least keep living together.  “You can’t marry someone unless you can trust them,” said Bishop Roger Gries. “So many times, I’ve sat through sessions with a couple where one person believes, ‘I can change him.’ Or the person thinks, ‘After we get married, she’ll change.’ People do that more often than you’d think.”  If a couple is fighting with each other and their families about nearly every detail of the wedding, that’s also a piercing warning siren.  “They have these destination weddings,” said Gries. “I was asked to do a wedding on a Florida beach. I refused. Most of the family couldn’t afford to attend. The wedding should be about a man and woman coming together, growing together, helping each other. Start praying with each other before you’re married – and then keep praying. God needs to be in the center of it.”  Don’t be in love with all the trappings and fantasies involved in the wedding. You can spend months, even a year, planning it – and it’s over almost faster than you say, “I do.”  Gries has been a priest for 60 years. He says people can’t worry about how it looks or what others will think if they realize they need to back out of the marriage.  The big point of this story: It’s not the wedding that’s life-changing, it’s the marriage.  READERS: As I was writing this column, I was stunned by the cost of a wedding. Can you tell me what you’ve paid for your own or for someone in your family? How about destination weddings? I’ll use some of your feedback for my next column.

"wedding","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","{""Columbia"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T17:19:00","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Aric Hutchinson wishes he could remember the crash, but he said he does remember his bride’s last words to him before the golf cart carrying them along a South Carolina beach road from their wedding reception was hit by a car driven by a woman who authorities say was drunk.  “The last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end,” he said in an interview broadcast Friday by ABC’s “Good Morning America.”  The bride, Samantha Miller, 34, was killed in the April 28 crash and Hutchinson and two other passengers were injured. A toxicology report showed the driver of the car, Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, had a blood alcohol level of 0.261 — over three times the legal limit. She is charged with reckless vehicular homicide and three counts of driving under the influence causing death or great bodily injury. Komoroski is currently being held without bond at a local jail, according to Charleston County Sheriff’s Office online records.  In a statement, Komoroski’s defense attorneys, Chris Gramiccioni, Deb Gramiccioni and Nathan Williams, asked the public not to rush to judgment.  “Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light,” they said.  Hutchinson said he remembers waking up in the hospital and knowing something was wrong when he saw his mother’s face.  “I asked her, ‘Where’s Sam? Where’s Sam?’ and that’s when she told me there was an incident and that Sam didn’t make it,” he recalled.  Hutchinson remembers Miller’s calmness on their wedding night despite all the stresses of wedding planning. Family and friends came from all over the country and everyone, including Miller, was so happy.  “I’m still trying to wrap my head around it, that night, going from an all-time high to an all-time low,” he said. “It’s pretty rough to try to comprehend.”  Being back at the home he and Miller shared is hard, “but also nice,” Hutchinson said.  “It’s got Sam written all over the house,” he said. “So it’s nice to be here and have good memories.”  Hutchinson said he doesn’t have anything to say to Komoroski at this time.  “I can’t right now,” he said. “I’d like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.”  In addition to the criminal case, Komoroski faces a wrongful death lawsuit alongside several businesses accused of overserving her on the night of the crash.  Four bars gave “copious amounts of alcohol” to a “visibly intoxicated” woman — Komoroski — last month before she drove 40 mph (64 kph) over the speed limit into a golf cart carrying the couple away from their wedding reception, according to a new lawsuit filed Wednesday by Hutchinson and his relatives.  A taqueria that had recently hired Komoroski is accused of negligence and recklessness. An unnamed Taco Boy supervisor coerced the new server into consuming “a dangerous amount of alcohol” at an employee function before the crash, according to the complaint.  In a statement on its website, Taco Boy denied that an “officially organized employee function around drinking” occurred. The statement said video footage, staff interviews and sales receipts confirm that Komoroski, who has since been fired, did not enter the restaurant on the day of the accident.

That’s because most of their guests, despite years of living in New York City, had never stepped foot onto Roosevelt Island, the residential waterfront Manhattan community sitting in the East River.  “I took the cable tram here once and then I went right back,” said David Wodka, a groomsman. “I never thought there was anything noteworthy on Roosevelt Island. But now that I’m here, I can see why they picked this venue. It’s beautiful, and you can see people jet skiing on the water.”  The ceremony was held at the Sanctuary, a wedding and events venue that took over this old church on the island’s north side over two years ago, rescuing it from ruin. With a leafy outdoor dining space that offers a plumb view of Manhattan’s skyline and an Instagrammable concrete pier that juts out into the East River, the Sanctuary has since become an unlikely matrimonial hot spot. Its pitch is that it is a destination wedding within city limits, reachable via a scenic tram ride from Midtown for the cost of a MetroCard swipe.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMjAvc3R5bGUvdGhlLXNhbmN0dWFyeS1yb29zZXZlbHQtaXNsYW5kLmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sinéad O'Leary and Brian McGrenaghan at Muckross Abbey  And it was during a summer stroll, back in the bride's home town, that they got engaged, four years later, on the shores of Lough Leane. “It was a beautiful warm sunny day and we took a walk with our daughter Lyla-Rose, who was almost two at the time, and our son Jack, who was only eight weeks old,” says Sinéad. “Brian had the ring box tucked away under his jumper and when I was admiring the view he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.”  Sinéad O'Leary and Brian McGrenaghan with their wedding party  That June proposal led to a November wedding, three years later, as they exchanged vows a little further along the road, in the Muckross Park Hotel & Spa, holding their reception in the same five-star venue.  Killarney National Park created the picture-perfect on their big day, which was precisely what the couple wanted, as they could pay tribute to the bride's father, the late Paudie O'Leary, in a special way.

The couple wanted their wedding to have “an outdoor feel inside with seasonal flowers and fauna”. “With it being a winter wedding we wanted candles to bring warmth into the reception and ceremony and deer antlers as a representation of my dad and the national park,” adds the bride.  Sinéad O'Leary and Brian McGrenaghan with their wedding party in Muckross Abbey  What made the occasion extra-memorable was that they could share it with family and friends, adds Sinéad, in particular, “our three beautiful children”.  Sinéad looked elegant in Spanish bridal label Pronovias, which she sourced in Sydney and the bridal hair and makeup were by Joanne Henderson and Sandra Flynn.

She said Rae did not provide the services she paid for with reasonable care and skill.  The referee agreed and ordered Rae to pay before June 11. Rae said she was asking for a rehearing because repeated phone calls from the tribunal referee did not connect.  In a counterclaim, Rae sought $3500 for stress and derogatory comments she alleged caused her to lose work. The referee dismissed Rae’s claim because the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear it.  In her decision, the referee said she tried to call Rae’s cellphone number seven times over 35 minutes to connect her to the hearing, but Rae did not answer. The absence of one party does not prevent a hearing going ahead.  The referee said she accepted Scott’s “straightforward and plausible” evidence.  Supplied/Supplied Scott’s bridesmaid, sister-in-law and celebrant having to work the bar.  Scott told the hearing she arranged for Rae to bring out platters for her guests at 4pm, but they didn't arrive until nearly 6pm, when the guests were about to start their main meal.  She had paid for three bar staff for six hours, but just one staff member was on site for several hours and they did not seem competent, resulting in her family feeling they needed to step in and serve drinks themselves, she said.  “I actually just had to try my hardest to ignore it, everyone told me not to worry but my bridesmaid, sister-in-law and celebrant had to work the bar,” Scott told Stuff.  Scott said she had put everything in writing for Rae so that the day would run as smoothly as possible and there would be no room for faults.  Glassware was not cleared away from tables as promised, and drink dispensers, barista-made coffee, tea, ice, lawn games, a dessert platter, a candy station and a generator were not provided as arranged, the referee said.  She acknowledged Rae had “resourcing and illness issues”, but said it was her responsibility to have backup plans to deliver what she promised.  Scott’s Google review included issues with the way Rae’s staff were dressed, and Rae leaving with her daughter for two hours without telling anyone.  “It’s already a stressful day to begin with and to have my grandparents come up and ask me why that girl was dressed like that, it was embarrassing,” Scott told Stuff.  “One of the young girls was wearing short shorts, a crop top and a crop top/bar and were all rude to the guests, we had many complain to us about their attire and their attitudes,” she wrote in the review.  Rae told Stuff she answered the referee’s calls but couldn’t hear anything, so asked for a rehearing.  Rae said, and put in a statement to the tribunal, that the wedding did not go as planned because two staff were sick with Covid and her daughter, who was one of the backup wait staff, started to feel very unwell in the extreme heat that day and she had to take her to hospital. The person who did work was called in at the last minute and had no time to dress differently.  She alleged some of the wedding guests were drunk and rude to the worker.  Supplied Rae was to provide bar services for guests, but sickness meant she was short-staffed. (File photo)  Rae told Stuff she agreed to stay two hours later to make up for the time she spent taking her daughter to hospital and was unable to do a hen party also booked for that night.  “Lots of different things went wrong. It’s not an excuse, it’s just what happened. It’s been an absolute palaver. I will never do any other wedding ever, not even for friends.”  While she gave the hen party a full refund, she said the guests all went online to give her one-star reviews, which, along with Scott’s Google review, prompted another upcoming bride to cancel. The contract meant she was not entitled to get her non-refundable deposit back, Rae said.  That bride, Monique Sara, told Stuff she cancelled because she lost faith in Rae’s ability to provide the service she expected. She said she booked Rae based on photographs she saw of the platters online, which were taken before Rae bought the business.  “It looked incredible but by the looks of things it was an old owner,” Sara said.  UNSPLASH Rae failed to provide platters for a 70th wedding anniversary at short notice but did pay a refund. (File photo)  Amanda Rait said she paid Rae $375* for two platters for her grandparents 70th wedding anniversary in January. However, Rae cancelled three-and-a-half hours before the event, which caused stress and disappointment. She received a full refund eventually, she said.  Rae said she had to cancel that event because she was assaulted the night before by people trying to steal her carts. She had two coffee carts previously and an ice cream cart that she bought and resold. She now hoped to sell the Fare Food Boutique Co cart and buy a smaller one to continue a smaller-scale coffee business.  Rae said the bad reviews had prompted rude messages and comments all over social media – “so much so we have ceased all business”.  “So currently there is no way of being able to pay anyone due to the online harassment and dressing down,” she said.  *A previous version of this story incorrectly said Amanda Rait paid $750 when she paid $375.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L2J1c2luZXNzLzEzMjA4MTU5MS9jYXRlcmVyLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tcmVmdW5kLWJyaWRlLTE1MDAtc2F5cy1zaGVsbC1uZXZlci1kby1hLXdlZGRpbmctYWdhaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

And now, in the past month alone, at least three other members of the Ottawa Senators have bent the knee to propose to their longtime girlfriends, all taking to Instagram to announce their big news to the world. In each case, their happy hockey teammates, past and present, jammed their replies with congratulatory messages.  Sens defenceman Thomas Chabot took a knee on a beautiful beach in Anguilla this week to propose to his longtime partner, Marion Pandreau.  Sens centre Jake Lucchini, who played 11 games for the Senators this season, also proposed this week to his girlfriend, Abbie Botz, back home in Madison, Wisconsin.

Needham House Hotel in the village of Little Wymondley, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, shut its doors earlier this month after the Home Office booked the property out completely for a year.  Jade Kolonics and her fiance Danny Neal were due to get married at the venue on August 25 and the couple were putting the finishing touches on their preparations.  Ms Kolonics said: 'Our invites have been sent and RSVP'd to, guests have booked hotel rooms - we have family coming down from all over - and now, only 15 weeks away from the big day, we have no venue, no food and no hotel rooms.  'I am beyond stressed and it has had a massive impact on my mental health.'  Jade Kolonics and her fiance Danny Neal were due to get married at the venue on August 25 and the couple were putting the finishing touches on their preparations  Nicola Harmel was supposed to be tying the knot at the hotel next summer but now wants to find another venue  Needham House Hotel in the village of Little Wymondley, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, shut its doors earlier this month after the Home Office booked the property out completely for a year  Nicola Harmel was supposed to be tying the knot at the hotel next summer but now wants to find another venue.  She is demanding a refund by Needham House but bosses say they can still hold the ceremony as the hotel should be free by then.  Ms Harmel fumed: 'We have our wedding booked next August and no refunds can be made because they have the government contract for one year.  'Needham House said the wedding will go ahead. However, the Novotel in Stevenage had a one-year government contract and it's now one and a half years and they still haven't opened the doors to the public.  'I cannot risk having three months to go for them to say they are extending the contract. We need the money from the deposit to put on another location.'  HAVE YOU BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CLOSURE? Email: tom.pyman@mailonline.co.uk  Meanwhile, customer Lewis Male said: 'My partner and I are due to get married in July and had over 25 rooms booked at this venue for our wedding for family and friends travelling up from Somerset.  'We are devastated and not sure what to do at all.'  Rob Close has his wedding booked at Needham House in 2024 but was given a nasty shock when he saw the state of the hotel after driving there recently to seek assurances his big day could still go ahead.  The Needham House Hotel (pictured) closed up earlier this month after the Home Office booked it out in its entirety for 230 migrants  The hotel (pictured inside), whose website is no longer in use, has cancelled 11 weddings and two proms since it was forced to shut up shop  He jumped in his car after getting no answer on the phone and said: 'I found the hotel starting to be stripped down, furniture moved out the way and being organised into different areas.  'We had a meeting at the venue on May 4 to discuss upgrades to our package, booking further rooms, and layouts, with no inclination of anything like this happening.  'I have heard deposits paid for 2024 will not be refunded as this contract is only for a year and Needham House could still honour these bookings, despite no way of telling what condition the facilities and rooms will be in.  'We are devastated as it the perfect venue for us but we are yet to have even heard from them.'  Miss Kolonics is expecting a refund of several thousand pounds for the disruption and has luckily now found a new venue for her big day at Knebworth Barns.  She said: 'I don't know who is to blame - is it the Government for taking over the hotel or is it Needham House Hotel for accepting it?  'But it isn't great to be told that you can't have your wedding there at such short notice when we've paid thousands of pounds and had much of the preparation work done.  'The Hotel have offered us a full refund - although they are not giving us any kind of compensation. They have also helped find another venue.

"wedding","2023-05-13","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:51:51","We’ve made it to the end of Wediquette Week and our final question packs a punch. This week we’ve talked about the cost of wedding gifts, plus ones and fashion. Read all four installments here. But today’s question is a two-parter that involves firing someone, essentially.  Question: A) Can I disinvite someone from a guest list? B) Also, related, can I fire a bridal party member?  Answer A: As a rule, disinviting a guest is one of the biggest ‘don’ts’ when it comes to weddings. This is why it’s so important to think long and hard about your guest list in the first place. If budget is a concern, create an A and a B list. Work from the A list first, then if spaces come available, begin adding from the B list. Meanwhile, life happens and people have fall outs. If that’s the case, it’s better to power through than to disinvite. There a few reasons for this: 1) No matter how upset the other party made you, disinviting them could create an unmendable rift. 2) Disinviting them could cause even more drama. 3) They might decide not to come without you disinviting them, so let the chips fall where they may, and it might work itself out. It could be beneficial to simply have a mature conversation (preferably in person or on the phone, but not via text or email unless it’s unavoidable, because you want the benefit of facial cues and body language) with the other party about what’s going on between the two of you. This could lead to mending the problem, a truce for the day of the wedding or, again, them deciding to sit this one out. If there are concerns over a person’s potential behavior at the wedding, this is also a good time to (maturely) address the situation.  Answer B: Any way you slice it, it can be tricky to fire an attendant. Also, there are a lot of reasons why you might want to and, since we don’t know the situation, here’s a general answer. It’s best to be direct and have a heart-to-heart. Again, this should happen in person or on the phone, but not via text or email unless it’s unavoidable, because you want the benefit of facial cues and body language. Approach he conversation with as much kindness and gentle grace as possible. A sample script is:  Get permission (this goes a long way): ‘Can we talk about the wedding?’  Indicate why you wanted them in your wedding in the first place: ‘I love you and you are one of my best friends, so naturally I want you to be a part of this wedding.’  Broach the problem: ‘But, it seems as though [insert problem here using feeling statements].’ (This could be anything from ‘it seems as though life is really hectic and it’s hard to participate in a lot of the wedding activities,’ to ‘I’ve noticed tension between you and my sister’ or whatever)  Say how this makes you feel: ‘I feel disappointed when I get an R.S.V.P. of yes and you’re absent, because I want to celebrate this time with you,’ or ‘it’s upsetting to me when I see you and my sister arguing.’ Again, stick with whatever it is you feel when the problem occurs.  Give them an escape hatch: If you are having a hard time with [insert some aspect of the duties and commitments or clashing with the other attendants] I’m thinking it might ease the situation if you were to bow out of attendant duties.  Invite them to speak: ‘What do you think?’  Listen with an open heart and mind to what they have to say and be gentle, but direct with your responses. Be clear about your expectations. Give them an opportunity to respond. They may feel attacked, so let them vent and try not to get worked up in response. Most of all, be considerate and maybe also bring an offering of chocolate. Everything is better with chocolate.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bmV3b3JsZWFucy5jb20vd2VkaXF1ZXR0ZS13ZWVrLWNhbi15b3UtZGlzaW52aXRlLWEtZ3Vlc3Qtb3ItbWVtYmVyLW9mLXRoZS1icmlkYWwtcGFydHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Imaginechina  A group wedding for local young talent was held on the Huangpu River waterfront in Yangpu District on Friday to mark the so-called ""Internet Valentine's Day"" in China.  Eight couples, including university teachers, doctors and high-tech professionals working in the district, made vows under the witness of over 100 guests and received wedding certificates from government officials including Jiang Rui, head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau.  ""I met my wife in Yangpu when I studied at the Naval Medical University, and she studied at the Tongji University,"" said one of the grooms surnamed Chen, who is a military doctor now.  ""Yangpu witnessed our love story over the last six years, and we will jointly contribute to its future development,"" he said.

Imaginechina  It's part of Yangpu's effort to develop the waterfront, known as the birthplace of China's modern industries with the nation's first water, electricity, shipbuilding and textile companies, into a people-friendly urban space.  The ceremony also answers the call of President Xi Jinping to highlight the importance of family and traditions, according to the Yangpu District government.  May 20 has become the third Valentine's Day in China, apart from the Chinese Valentine's Day on qixi, or the lunar July 7, and the Western Valentine's Day on February 14, because ""5.20"" sounds like ""I love you"" in Chinese.  Another group wedding was held on the North Bund in Hongkou District ahead of May 20. Five couples, including construction workers, tech and finance elite, and community staff working on the North Bund, got married and shared their love stories related to the waterfront.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL25ld3MvbWV0cm8vMjMwNTE5MTAwNS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-19","19:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T03:41:29","There was excitement in the air. The guests were dressed up in traditional ethnic wear. There were flowers and intricate rangoli. And a beautiful bride-to-be. Soon, the beating of drums at the gate signalled that the procession was on its way.  Welcome to the wedding of Bunty and Babli.  But then, the bride and bridegroom were not real. It was a unique wedding of dolls organised by Shreevatsa — a childcare institute that provides shelter, family, education and medical aid to family-deprived and destitute children — at the Sassoon general hospital.  “This was a fantastic way of teaching these children the meaning of the institution of family. This was a way of imparting knowledge of our community to the children,” said Nirmala Lahoti, a committee member of the Society of Friends of Sassoon Hospitals (SOFOSH), which collaborated with Shreevatsa for the event.  “These children do not have a family. There are certain events in our society that we are exposed to. We organise multiple activities throughout the year so that the children have an orientation of the events that take place in every household. We celebrate each and every festival,” said Sharmila Sayed, the administration head of Shreevatsa.  At the “wedding” on Friday evening, Shreevatsa members danced with the children to vibrant beats and Marathi pop numbers. All the elements of a real wedding were in place: coloured rice was distributed followed by the recitation of the “mangalashtak” and the varmala ceremony of the dolls named Bunty and Babli.  “A wedding ceremony is no less than a festival in an Indian household. Therefore, we ensured that we did our best to make this event as memorable as possible. We also invited children who were adopted. This is our way of showing them that they will always have a family here,” said Sayed.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvcHVuZS9idW50eS13ZWRzLWJhYmxpLWEtd2VkZGluZy1pbi10aGUtZmFtaWx5LWZvci1jaGlsZHJlbi13aXRob3V0LWZhbWlsaWVzLTg2MTkzNjYv0gGCAWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvcHVuZS9idW50eS13ZWRzLWJhYmxpLWEtd2VkZGluZy1pbi10aGUtZmFtaWx5LWZvci1jaGlsZHJlbi13aXRob3V0LWZhbWlsaWVzLTg2MTkzNjYvbGl0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""SaintPaul"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:51:15","Murder, mystery and romance have been in the air lately with a swathe of new Hallmark movie releases hitting the 2023 TV schedule . Though the channel is trying out some new titles like Curious Caterer, it’s also bringing back some major fan favorites. Among them is the latest installment in the Hannah Swensen Mysteries series (formerly Murder, She Baked). I was lucky enough to hear from Alison Sweeney about the latest installment Carrot Cake Murder. Ahead of the film’s release we talked weddings, “prop” desserts, one reader-favorite cat and more.  As fans already know, Hannah (Sweeney) and her partner in crime solving Mike (Cameron Mathison) have been engaged for a while – even during the course of events of the last franchise flick, Sweet Revenge. When I asked Ms. Sweeney about whether a wedding was imminent in her follow-up to the second Wedding Veil trilogy, she brought up what we know from Joanne Fluke’s books, but also joked about a body near a wedding cake.  Since Hannah hasn’t gotten married for real in the books, (except one time to a con artist that ended up being annulled lol), I can only imagine what her wedding would be like! I mean… would she find a dead body underneath the cake?!  Speaking of cake, I’ve always wondered how the cast manages to film all those dessert scenes without it impacting their waistlines, and Ms. Sweeney let us in on a bit of a secret: “prop desserts.” Though there seems to be some eating involved, as the actress told CinemaBlend she often chooses which Joanne Fluke book she’d like to try next based on the recipes included in the books, keeping those sweets in check is part of the movie-making magic.  Yes - I often narrow down the books to consider what’s next based on the delicious titles. So many yummy recipes to choose from, and then lots of 'prop' desserts to avoid eating too much of [them]!  I guess one really can have their (carrot) cake and eat it too.  Sweeney and co. acquired the rights to the Fluke books ahead of the last film in the series, which led to the name change from Murder, She Baked to Hannah Swensen Mysteries. Despite some BTS complications related to the changes, the franchise is still going strong and Hallmark announced this week another one will be released in the coming months. The next film, A Zest for Death: A Hannah Swensen Mystery, will be based on the Joanne Fluke novel Lemon Meringue.  It's great news for the fans, as we have seen some murder mysteries canceled at Hallmark in recent months. There's so much more for the franchise to explore regarding Hannah's growth in mystery-solving as well as in her personal life, so I'm happy the movies were able to continue.  Sweeney previously told TV Insider the couple is “not very far into planning the wedding,” when the new movie picks up, so fans will likely be waiting for another Swensen sequel before they can get excited for a body at a wedding or -- let's be honest about what we're most excited about -- Hannah's choice of a dress. For now, she’s keeping mum on actual wedding plans, but she did say book fans should keep an eye out for “Moishe the cat” not being so happy about the engagement in the new film.  The plot's an Easter egg book fans can look forward to, though I'm still hoping we'll get more forward momentum this time around, and I'm not just talking about solving a mystery. Carrot Cake Murder premieres on Friday, May 19th at 9 p.m. ET, only on Hallmark.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5lbWFibGVuZC5jb20vdGVsZXZpc2lvbi93aWxsLWhhbm5haC1hbmQtbWlrZS1nZXQtbWFycmllZC1pbi1oYW5uYWgtc3dlbnNlbi1teXN0ZXJpZXMtaGFsbG1hcmtzLWFsaXNvbi1zd2VlbmV5LXRhbGtzLXdlZGRpbmdzLXByb3AtZGVzc2VydHMtYW5kLW1vcmXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This shift towards maximalist weddings is reflected in the choice of fashion of bold colors and relaxed styles, with double-breasted jackets taking the spotlight over traditional suits.  MrGuild founder Gee Beller has announced that the UK-based e-commerce brand is exploring the trend of wedding attire, particularly the rising trend of double-breasted jackets over traditional suits. With the summer season approaching, the demand for alternative and bold colours is also increasing, and MrGuild is at the forefront of this fashion trend.  “Weddings have always been an essential part of British culture, and as fashion evolves, so do the traditional customs surrounding weddings,” said Gee Beller. “We’re seeing a shift towards more relaxed and casual wedding attire, with double-breasted jackets becoming increasingly popular as a statement piece.”  60% increase in double-breasted suit sales  In recent years, classic men’s suits have changed form, with cruisers and double-breasted jackets emerging as the new trend. This shift in men’s fashion is reflected in MrGuild’s sales figures, with a 60% increase in double-breasted suit sales compared to the previous year.  “We’re thrilled to see our double-breasted jackets gaining popularity, as they are versatile and can be dressed up or down for any occasion,” added Gee Beller. “We’re also seeing a demand for alternative colours, with green suits being especially popular over the past year.”  The double-breasted suits from MrGuild offer a unique experience to the wearer. Customers have expressed their love for these suits, citing their perfect fit, comfort, and attractive design. However, it’s not just about the physical aspects of the suit, but also the sense of empowerment and courage that it instils in the wearer.  Symbol of individuality and style  The suits from MrGuild are more than just clothing – they’re a symbol of individuality and style that help customers make a statement on their big day. It’s no wonder that customers keep coming back for more, eager to experience the unparalleled quality and service that MrGuild is known for. If one is looking for a suit that will make them feel truly special and help them shine on their wedding day, they need look no further than MrGuild.  “Bold colours are the new trend for grooms, and our emerald-green suits are the perfect statement piece for a fashion-forward groom,” said Gee Beller. In addition to bold colours, custom tailoring is becoming more popular in 2023 as grooms seek a suit that is truly one-of-a-kind. Every aspect of the suit, from the fabric to the buttons, can be customized to suit personal style.  Bigger, maximalist weddings are calling  “After several years of smaller, low-key weddings due to social distancing guidelines, we’re expecting to see a shift towards bigger, more maximalist weddings,” said Gee Beller. “We’re excited to be at the forefront of this trend, offering unique and statement-making pieces that will make any groom stand out on their special day.”  In the lead up to the summer wedding season, MrGuild is proud to offer stylish and versatile options for grooms who want to make a statement on their special day. From bold colours to classic double-breasted suits, the collections are designed to meet the evolving needs of today’s fashion-forward couples.

Kate arrived in the back of a Rolls Royce Phantom VI alongside her father, and she looked stunning in a Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen lace gown.  It featured a V-neck, long sleeves and a corset bodice, as well as a nine-foot train that her maid of honour Pippa Middleton was pictured holding.  After they exchanged vows, Kate and William hosted a reception at Buckingham Palace, where Kate changed into a strapless gown with an embellished waist and a fur jacket.

The 35-year-old actress - who was initially married to hockey player Mike Comrie from 2010 until 2016 and has 11-year-old son Luca with him - tied the knot with musician Matthew, 35, in 2019 and took to social media on Thursday (18.05.23) to acknowledge their four years together as husband and wife.  Alongside a throwback snap of their engagement, she wrote on Instagram: ""I would say yes again and again.""  The former 'Lizzie McGuire' star - who now has Banks, four, and two-year-old Mae with Matthew - is thought to have held the nuptials at her own house with ""only family and friends"" invited, an insider explained at the time.  The source told PEOPLE: ""The ceremony started at sunset and they got married inside the house. When the ceremony was over, guests cheered. The reception was in a white tent in the backyard.""  The anniversary post comes just days after the 'How I Met Your Father' actress revealed that she follows a fasting diet in an effort to keep her slim figure as she explained that she she gets up “really hungry” but sustains herself with coffee.  Hilary accepted that her fasting practices could be deemed to be controversial in the same way Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow's statements back in March about intermittent fasts and bone broth meals were.  Speaking on the 'Lipstick on the Rim' podcast, she said: ""Sometimes I try to – you know, Gwyneth’s in trouble for saying this – but sometimes I try to just drink coffee in the morning and starve off my hunger.”  The actress-and-singer added she was “obsessed” with “cauliflower rounds” which she hailed as a “super clean” food. To improve the taste and texture she likes to crisp them in an air fryer.  Hilary tops them with egg salad, a fried egg, avocado, or vegan sausage, and enjoys overnight oats.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T09:45:04","Wedding season is underway and the clock is ticking to nail down an outfit — whether you’re a gown, cocktail dress, jumpsuit or matching-set kind of person. And nothing makes or breaks a look quite like your choice of shoe. Your footwear has to complement your look while remaining relevant to the location and dress code, plus be comfortable enough to dance in until the wee hours of the morning.  We tapped a couple of experts for professional guidance on the matter. Stylist James Bianca believes the ideal wedding sandal is one that marries both beauty and comfort. Shawna Ferguson, a stylist and costume designer, said your choice of footwear should “be a cut above your go-to sandals that you throw on for brunch or to run errands, but should not be so eye-catching as to distract from the real focus of the event.”  Advertisement  While both of our experts shared that either flat or heel sandals are completely appropriate for casual or semi-formal weddings, Bianca personally prefers heels over flats for their ability to elongate the leg and elevate your overall wedding guest look. That said, they both strongly cautioned against stiletto heels — block, wedge or platform heels are definitely the way to go. Bianca also recommended finding a shoe that can be securely strapped into place, further stabilizing your foot so you can dance the night away safely and comfortably.  Ferguson mentioned that neutrals and natural-fiber designs work beautifully for more casual daytime weddings while minimal strappy sandals can be dressed up for evening events. If you prefer a more eye-catching vibe, she said, “sculptural heel details can be more playful than a standard platform.”  If you’re still at a loss, Bianca pointed out that you can always just go with a metallic. “Gold and silver can act as neutral and gives you more value because you can style it with other looks throughout wedding season and beyond.”  Below, we rounded up a selection of wedding guest sandals per our experts’ recommendations.

On Friday afternoon, the Selling Sunset star, 45, confirmed that he and his German model girlfriend, 25, have not wed, after an Instagram post shared on their accounts had fans congratulating them.  The couple jointly posted a series of photos of Nurk in a white, feather-adorned mini dress and Oppenhiem in a black suit and white shirt. The images, by photographer Charlotte Lobry, show the couple playfully running and lounging beside a luxurious hotel pool, as well as posing in the front seat of a vintage car.  The post was initially captioned, ""Here's to a lifetime of adventures.""  Charlotte Lobry @charlottelobry  After their followers began offering their well wishes on what many assumed was an engagement or wedding announcement, they quickly changed the caption to read, ""You always make me smile.""  ""Damn, he finally did it! He got married I never would've thought! They are so cute together,"" one fan wrote. Another added, ""Awwww congratulations!!""  Oppenheim set the record straight in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE: ""Lou and I quickly realized that our post on Instagram made it look like we had just been married. We received numerous congratulatory texts, as well as angry texts from friends asking why they weren't invited, so quickly changed the caption! All these photos were from an event that we went to together a couple of months ago.""  Charlotte Lobry @charlottelobry  The broker also spoke about the mix-up on Sirius XM's Hits1 Friday afternoon. When the hosts asked why he seemed to be glued to his phone at the beginning of the interview segment, he explained, ""My girlfriend posted something and people think that we got married. I think the caption also leads into this. She posted photos of us that look like a wedding.""  Oppenheim said he was receiving ""congratulations"" texts from celebrity friends and professional contacts. Asked if there was any truth to the matter, Oppenheim said, ""No, I'm not married.""  Charlotte Lobry @charlottelobry  Oppenheim and Nurk met in July 2022 while they were both vacationing on the island of Mykonos in Greece. The pair were first photographed kissing in a parking lot and during that same trip, Oppenheim made his debut on Nurk's Instagram Story.  Soon after, they confirmed their relationship by walking the red carpet together at a movie premiere in August. ""I knew how much I liked her pretty quickly,"" Oppenheim told PEOPLE In a September interview.  Since then the couple have been enjoying a globe-hopping romance, traveling to Australia, Paris and back to the Greek Island where they met. They've also become co-stars. Oppenheim confirmed to PEOPLE last fall that Nurk would appear on season 6 of Selling Sunset, which is now streaming on Netflix.  Charlotte Lobry @charlottelobry  Oppenheim and Nurk now share a stunning condo in L.A. and recently gave PEOPLE a tour of the space.  We're living here, I think, for many years,"" Oppenheim said. ""I've lived in many nice places, but this is my favorite place by far."" The 5,500-square-foot space has a wraparound terrace, a 10-seat private movie theater and stunning views of the hills.  Nurk splits her time between California and Paris, where she's based for work, and recently opened up about the sometimes difficult realities of dating long distance.  ""The truth is, we both knew from the beginning that I would have to move back because of my job, friends, and family being here,"" she wrote in response to a fan question on social media. ""Long distance relationships can be tough, but we're both committed to making it work. We make sure to communicate regularly and make time for each other despite the distance.""  She continued: ""While it's not always easy, we both believe that our love is worth the effort. I'm grateful to have such a supportive partner who understands my goals and passions. At the end of the day, it's important to follow your heart and pursue your dreams, even if it means taking risks and facing challenges.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9ob21lL3NlbGxpbmctc3Vuc2V0LXN0YXItamFzb24tb3BwZW5oZWltLWFuZC1tYXJpZS1sb3UtbnVyay1tYXJyaWVkLWRlbmlhbC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

An example of this is OnlyFans. The app, which was created with the aim of having celebrities share exclusive content with fans who paid a subscription, went awry along the way and has ended up being a space where users of this platform publish explicit videos and fulfil the desires of their followers who pay a certain amount of money for them.

""I ruined my mom's marriage, I never planned telling this story on TikTok, but here we are,"" she said on TikTok.  ""So when I first started my website, I had this customer who was my number one customer, bought every single thing that I sent him, he was pretty much a follower since the beginning.  ""We would talk every day, he made custom requests, very specific things, and he also had a very specific user name on the website.""

And with catering costs usually increasing with the more guests you invite, it can be frustrating if you have people that RSVP to your wedding and then don't show up.  To combat this problem, one bride has taken some extreme measures - as she's threatening to take her wedding guests to court if they RSVP to her special day and then don't show up.  The bride said her family can be ""flaky"" at times so she can't trust them to actually turn up even if they say they will, so she wants to make sure she can recoup the costs of catering and services if they decide not to come.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  In a post on Facebook which was later shared to Reddit, she wrote: ""I love my family dearly but sometimes they are flaky. I'm getting married in October of 2024 and when I send out invitations, I want to put on the invitation that if they RSVP and don't come, I'm taking them to court for the cost of their portion of the food and services I paid for.  ""Is that tacky? Obviously, there's no cost to them if they RSVP and actually come.""  Commenters on the Reddit post were baffled by the bride's idea though, as many of them said her claims likely wouldn't stand up in court because RSVPing to an event isn't a legally binding contract.  One person explained: ""She would have to file each claim individually in small claims court. Each individual claim would get thrown out because there is literally nothing in contract law in any universe that would say an RSVP is a contract. And if any one of the defendants had given her a gift that would likely count as fulfilling their side of the bargain anyway.""  While another said: ""How can you be so clueless that you don't realise this is tacky?""  And a third posted: ""Step one on how to ensure there are zero guests attending your wedding.""  Meanwhile, another commenter said they could understand the bride's frustration after they had a family of six people RSVP to their wedding and not show up, which cost them around £800. However, despite the incident leaving them ""upset"", they still wouldn't dream of taking the family to court.  They wrote: ""I had a family of six RSVP and not show up. Didn't have a great excuse either, just didn't want to come. We had a weekend of stuff going on so it cost me about $1,000 (£800). I'm obviously upset, but court? No.""  Do you have a story to sell?

There was a strong revival in the business post Covid but this summer failed to meet the expectations. Business in the peak summer season is apprehended to go down by around 50 per cent. Marriage gardens and other stakeholders have pegged business of over Rs 100 crore in the peak wedding season. Indore has close to 100 marriage gardens and more venues are expected to get added to the list with the coming of new chains of hotels in the city.Saurabh Agrawal , owner of a catering business said, “The summer wedding period did not work this time. Usually this is the main period when we earn more than 50 per cent of our revenues but this season went flat. We have cut down heavily on contractual workers due to less wedding bookings. Our industry works on contractual workers and we hire around 150 to 200 contractual workers for a single event.”The hospitality sector is now pinning hopes on enquiries for weddings scheduled in the winter months and on leisure travel in the summer vacation period.

In fact, the wedding stress in some extreme situations can end up impacting the couple and the associated families to such an extent that it winds up taking a toll on their health. And as the wedding date approaches, the worry just continues to mount and robs you of the actual wedding enjoyment. According to a survey by Zola (Wedding Registry Firm), 96% of couples acknowledged that planning a wedding is difficult, with over half of them describing their sentiments as ""very stressful"" or ""extremely stressful.""Hiring a wedding planner is the best move to make if you want to focus fully on your ""happily ever after"" and escape the burden and worry of wedding planning . Doing so will allow you to make the most of your wedding while leaving all the work to the planner. In fact, the planner will utilize your vision to make your dream wedding a reality. Since they will play a key role on one of the most important days of your life, finding a wedding planner who is knowledgeable, experienced, and shares your and your partner's vision is unquestionably vital.Although the market is flooded with wedding planners that does not necessarily mean that each option is a good fit for you. Check out their website and portfolio as a starting point to look over their past works in order to determine if they match your taste. Also, do not miss to look up their social media to get a hint of their aesthetics and style.Once that you have shortlisted a list of planners the next step involves meeting them in-person. Their work might look very enticing on their website or social media but does it appear to connect with your ideas and vision? Planning a couple of initial sessions with the planner will allow you to determine whether you and the planner are on the same page and if they would be a valuable addition to your wedding. Also, make sure to examine whether the planner understands your and your partner's needs and can turn your ideal wedding into a reality.Finding someone you actually enjoy working with is crucial because you will be in daily contact with your wedding coordinator until the big day. If you cannot discover common ground with a wedding planner despite their incredibly attractive portfolio, it is best to search elsewhere. Given that your planner will become a part of your family, it is essential to ensure that his sensibilities align with yours in every way to prevent any future conflicts.Going through the wedding planner's earlier work will not only give you ideas and inspiration for your own event, but it will also enable you to determine whether or not their style corresponds to your own. In addition, it will also provide you a sneak peek into their creativity and innovation. For your dream wedding to become a reality, it is crucial for your planner to understand your ideas and vision and have the imagination necessary to make them come true.Transparent communication between you and your wedding planner is the foundation of a dream wedding. The planner should be proactive and maintain frequent communication with you to keep you updated on the preparations and reduce your stress. As a result, it is recommended that you establish a mutual means of communication with your wedding planner as soon as you finalize one.A wedding planner who is not current on the latest wedding trends and fads won't be able to make your ideal wedding come true. Knowledge applies to all aspects of wedding planning, from selecting a seasoned venue to interior design and theme. In fact, given that weddings are a huge affair, unannounced problems are bound to take place. And when the entire plan falls apart, it all depends on the wedding planner's capabilities to come up with a constructive alternative.Weddings are mostly a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Embracing those moments of their lives, a couple wants everything to be perfect on their wedding day. In order to set aside all your wedding worries and make the most of the day, it is imperative for the wedding couple to hire a wedding planner. The wedding planner will not only grasp your wedding vision but will also make it a reality beyond your imagination.Consequently, if you want to have the ideal wedding you have dreamed of since you were a child, choosing the right wedding planner is essential. And to reduce stress and tension throughout your wedding, it is critical to invest significant amount of time and effort in finding the perfect wedding planner.(The writer is Director, Event Planner for Asia, Resh&Co.)","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8vaG93LXRvLXNlbGVjdC1hLXN1aXRhYmxlLXdlZGRpbmctcGxhbm5lci1mb3IteW91ci1iaWctZmF0LXdlZGRpbmcvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMzUzNjc0LmNtc9IBhwFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3ctdG8vaG93LXRvLXNlbGVjdC1hLXN1aXRhYmxlLXdlZGRpbmctcGxhbm5lci1mb3IteW91ci1iaWctZmF0LXdlZGRpbmcvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDM1MzY3NC5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The royal duo has become one of the most talked-about couples ever since rumors began circulating that they were dating. Fast forward to now, and they are happily married parents of two, celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary. While their romance was a whirlwind, the two have proven that they are meant to be!  As they quietly ring in five years of marriage amid turmoil surrounding their recent encounter with the paparazzi, let's look back at Harry and Meghan's romance for the ages.  July 2016: They Meet  The couple met in early July after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend believed to Violet von Westenholz, according to Katie Nicholl's book Harry: Life, Loss and Love. Von Westenholz's father is a friend of Prince Charles, which explains the Harry connection, and works for Ralph Lauren, which is how she met Meghan.  In their adorable engagement interview, Harry spoke fondly of their first meeting. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her [for the first time],""he shared. ""I was like, 'Wow, OK. I'm going to have to up my game here. I'm going to sit down and make sure I got a good chat.'""  Their second date immediately followed, the two meeting at Soho House London.  August 2016: Botswana Under the Stars  After those two dates in London, Harry was clearly smitten and invited Meghan to join him in Botswana, before he jetted to an AIDS conference in South Africa. She accepted the invitation.  ""I think about three, maybe four weeks later [after we met], I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,"" Harry gushed in their engagement interview. ""We spent five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other.""  Harry would later source the main diamond of Meghan's engagement ring from the African country because it plays such a special role in their relationship. But we're getting ahead of ourselves...  November 2016: Prince Harry Releases a Telling Statement  After several rumors surrounding the Suits star and the red-headed royal led to Meghan being followed and harassed once she was back in Toronto to shoot the USA show, Harry took matters into his own hands. In a rare move, Harry released an official statement from Kensington Palace, both referring to Meghan as his ""girlfriend"" and condemning those harassing her.  ""It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm,"" the statement read. ""He knows commentators will say this is 'the price she has to pay' and that 'this is all part of the game.' He strongly disagrees. This is not a game -- it is her life and his.""  The telling moment of chivalry marked a new stage in Harry’s dating life, as Meghan became the first of Harry's girlfriends to be so publicly acknowledged.

We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news,"" she told the magazine. ""And I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception. Nothing about me changed. I'm still the same person that I am, and I've never defined myself by my relationship.""  November 2017: Engagement Confirmation!  After filming wrapped on Meghan’s final season of Suits, she was spotted moving across the pond days before her engagement news broke.

In their statement, the couple said they would work to become financially independent and split their time between the United Kingdom and North America.  ""The queen is devastated by the decision, although she had been aware of their struggle the last few months and has been concerned for their well-being and happiness. Many family members were very disappointed with the Sussexes,"" a source told ET shortly thereafter, noting that some members of the royal family have called the move ""selfish.""  A royal family meeting soon followed, and eventually the couple reached a resolution that involved them losing their HRH titles and stripping Harry of his military appointments. Later, the Harry and Meghan were told that they could not keep the name of their charitable foundation as ""Sussex Royal"" due to their exit.  Before making things official, the couple went on one last U.K. tour, which culminated in a Commonwealth Day event. While they initially settled in Canada, in March, the couple made the move to Los Angeles. Harry and Meghan officially closed their royal office on April 1.  Summer 2020: Life in Los Angeles  Amid quarantine, the couple gave back and got involved in the Black Lives Matter movement.  ""They are busy and they are doing quite a lot behind the scenes, but you know, this is a couple that tends to operate 100 miles per hour. I think they're enjoying the lockdown and the fact that they've been able to take a bit of a breather,"" royal expert Katie Nicholl told ET. ""It's been a very, very busy year for them, and I think this is a moment to just take a breath, reflect, and I think that's what they'll be doing on their anniversary.""  In July, the couple moved to an 18,000 square foot home in Montecito, California, which they purchased for $14.9 million. Two months later, the couple officially became financially independent from the royal family.  November 2020: Meghan Reveals She Suffered a Miscarriage  In an op-ed for The New York Times, Meghan revealed that she suffered a miscarriage a few months prior.  ""After changing [Archie's] diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right,"" she wrote. ""I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.""  ""Hours later, I lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband’s hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears,"" Meghan continued. ""Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we'd heal.""  February 2021: Baby No. 2  On Valentine's Day, Harry and Meghan announced that they were ""overjoyed"" to be expecting their second child.  Shortly after they announced that their family is growing, a palace spokesman told ET, ""Her Majesty, [the] Duke of Edinburgh, [the] Prince of Wales and the entire family are delighted and wish them well,"" referring to Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Prince Charles.  March 2021: The Oprah Sit-Down  In the wake of Harry and Meghan's baby news, and around the same time the couple made their royal exit permanent, CBS announced that the duo would sit down for a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey.  When the interview aired, there were no shortage of bombshells. Among the biggest reveals were the fact that Harry and Meghan secretly got married before their royal wedding; that one member of the royal family expressed concern over what color Archie's skin would be; that Meghan was suicidal during her first pregnancy; that Harry's relationships with Prince Charles and Prince William remained strained.  Afterwards, Buckingham Palace reacted to the interview.  ""The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,"" the Palace said in a statement. ""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning.""  ""While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately,"" the statement continued. ""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.""  While Harry did speak to his father and brother after the interview aired, they were ""not productive"" conversations, according to Gayle King.  June 2021: Meghan Gives Birth  The couple welcomed their second child, and shared the joyous news in a statement.  ""It is with great joy that Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, welcome their daughter, Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, to the world,"" the statement read. ""Lili was born on Friday, June 4 at 11:40 a.m. in the trusted care of the doctors and staff at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, CA. She weighed 7 lbs 11 oz.""  ""Both mother and child are healthy and well, and settling in at home. Lili is named after her great-grandmother, Her Majesty The Queen, whose family nickname is Lilibet. Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honor her beloved late grandmother, The Princess of Wales,"" the statement continued. ""This is the second child for the couple, who also have a two-year-old son named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. The Duke and Duchess thank you for your warm wishes and prayers as they enjoy this special time as a family.""  Harry and Meghan added, ""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we’ve felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""  July 2021: Prince Harry Announces Memoir  Penguin Random House announced that it would publish Harry's first memoir, a move that royal experts speculated would further the rift between Harry and his family.  ""I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become,"" Harry said in a statement. ""I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story -- the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned -- I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think.""  ""I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far,"" he added, ""and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful.""  In October 2022, Harry's memoir was revealed to be titled Spare, and the book was given a release date of Jan. 10. Additionally, it was announced that proceeds from the book will go to various charities including Sentebale and WellChild.  Netflix  December 2022: A Netflix Docuseries  Harry & Meghan, a six-episode docuseries, was announced and offered fans a rare peek inside the couple's life. As the first three episodes were released, the series' disclaimer said that members of the royal family declined to comment on the show, which the royals denied.  The episodes were full of new information about Harry and Meghan -- from Harry's secret Instagram account to Meghan's first meeting with William and Kate. Harry also compared his wife to his late mother, and the couple shared rare pics of their two kids.  After Harry and Meghan denied claims that the series was hypocritical, the last three episodes of the show were released. Those episodes detailed a yelling match between Harry and William, saw the couple speak about their devastating miscarriage, and showed Harry reflecting on his royal exit.  January 2023: 'Spare' Is Released  Harry held nothing back in his memoir, discussing everything from once taking mushrooms at Courteney Cox's house to dealing with his grandparents' death after his royal exit, to thinking of William as his ""archnemesis.""  Harry also wrote about his childhood trauma, his father's teddy bear, losing his virginity, his past relationships, his time in the military and his mental health.  Then there was the talk about Meghan, from how they met and fell in love, all the way to their royal family exit.  March 2023: Harry and Meghan Are Evicted  King Charles III told the couple to forego the home they kept in the U.K. since their 2018 wedding.  ""We can confirm the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage,"" a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan told ET.  Harry and Meghan have until early summer to vacate the property. It has not been confirmed who delivered the eviction notice, however, ET confirmed it was at the directive of the king.  ""Since Harry's book was released, relationships between Harry and Meghan and the family have never been worse. Charles is extremely disappointed in what was shared in the book,"" a source told ET. ""Harry was disrespectful to Camilla in the book and you can’t expect to act that way without consequences.""  On the heels of the news, the couple stepped out for the first time since Spare's release. According to pics obtained by Page Six, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex enjoyed a private dinner at San Vicente Bungalows in Los Angeles.  March 2023: Lilibet Has a Private Christening  The couple chose to christen their youngest child in a private ceremony at their Montecito, California, home. According to People, the ceremony had between 20 and 30 guests, which included Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, Lilibet's godfather, Tyler Perry, and an unnamed godmother. Despite issuing invitations to King Charles III, Camila, Queen Consort, Prince William and Kate Middleton, no royals attended the event.  Though the royals did not attend the christening, Lilibet and Archie later received official royal titles of ""prince"" and ""princess"" on the royal website that same month.  Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images  April 2023: Harry and Meghan Let Loose  Harry and Meghan enjoyed a parents' night out at the L.A. Lakers vs. the Memphis Grizzlies game, where they were spotted on the Crypto.com Arena's Jumbotron.  An eyewitness at the game told ET that the crowd was cheering loudly for the couple, in a very positive way, when they appeared on the Jumbotron.  ""They giggled when they realized they were on the big screen. They seemed really happy and were having a lot of fun,"" the eyewitness added.  May 2023: Harry Attends King Charles III's Coronation Without Meghan  As was previously announced, the Duke of Sussex attended his father's coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, May 6, without his wife by his side. Harry was only in London for just over 24 hours for the historic event. Meanwhile, Meghan stayed behind to celebrate their son, Archie's, fourth birthday.  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Ms. Foundation for Women  May 2023: A Public Event Turns Terrifying  The couple stepped out at the Ms. Foundation Women of Vision Awards in New York City with Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland. They were all smiles with Meghan in a gold gown to receive an award at the event. But as they were leaving the occasion, things took a turn for the family.  ""Last night, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi,"" their spokesperson said in a statement to ET.  ""This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,"" the statement continued. ""While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone’s safety. Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained, encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all in involved.""  The New York Police Department's Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Julian Phillips also issued a statement to ET in response to the incident, saying officers ""assisted the private security team protecting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. There were numerous photographers that made their transport challenging. The Duke and Duchess arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries or arrested in regard.""  Backgrid USA photo agency claimed in a statement to ET that the ""freelance contributors... were covering the couple's stay in New York City, including the possibility of a dinner after an award ceremony."" The company alleged that the photographers ""had no intention of causing any distress or harm, as their only tool was their cameras.""

There is always a ceremony that is considered the “wedding of the year” and, in 2023, it was the turn of Sofia Richie and Elliot Grainge‘s union. The weekend festivities took place at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, south of France, and included guests such as Cameron Diaz, Benji Madden, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, and Joel Madden.  The model and designer shared everything on her social media. She wore a trio of dresses created by Chanel for her rehearsal dinner, wedding ceremony and after-party. As Richie walked down the aisle with her dad, Stephen Sanchez was singing her favorite song: “Until I Found You”.  Even though Sofia´s wedding was iconic, there are many other cerimonies that were remarkable as well. So, here is more model’s weddings to die for.  Kate Moss  The supermodel Kate Moss got married to Jamie Hince, in 2011, in Costwold Village, England. Inspired by rock’n roll and Great Gatsby the party that lasted three days was full of A-list celebrities and fashion designers. Some of the guests were Naomi Campbel, Stella and Paul McCartney, Jude Law, Vivienne Westwood, Christian Louboutin and Marc Jacobs. Kate Moss wore a retro chic dress design by her friend and designer John Galiano.  Hailey Bieber  Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber got married in 2019, in the Montage Palmetto Bluff hotel, in South Carolina, a year after the couple wedding in a private civil ceremony in New York.  For the rehearsal dinner, Hailey wore a Vivienne Westwood minidress, and a custom off-white wedding gown designed by her late friend and designer Virgil Abloh, with the phrase “Till death do us part” in the train, for the ceremony. For the wedding reception, she wore a Ralph & Russo dress with a halter neckline and also a Vera Wang slip dress with sneakers.  Usher, Joan Smalls, Justine Skye, Jaden Smith, Kris Jenner and her boyfriend Corey Gamble, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner and her daughter Stormi were some of the celebrities who attended the festivities. During the reception, Justin Bieber even sang “One Last Only Girl” to Hailey Bieber.  Karlie Kloss  Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner were married in October in a small Jewish ceremony in New York. In that day, the supermodel wore a custom made Dior gown. The couple had a second wedding at Brush Creek Ranch, in Wyoming, with only 80 guests. Some of them were: Derek Blasberg, Diane von Furstenberg, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Mila Kunis, Princess Beatrice, Ivanka Trump and Serena Williams. The weekend was full of activities like karaoke, horseback riding, paintball and fireworks.  Lais ribeiro  Last year the Brazilian supermodel and Victoria’s Secrets Angel, Lais Ribeiro, got married to the former professional basketball player, Joakim Noah, in Trancoso, Bahia. The model wore a custom made dress by Galia Lahav and feets in the sand. Some days before the couple said “yes” in a religious ceremony at Miguel Alves, Lais’ hometown.

"wedding","2023-05-13","00:00:00","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T00:21:23","Annelore Harrell  Bluffton Today  It had been a lovely garden wedding, beautiful bride, adoring groom, beaming parents, and grandparents.  This was an intimate wedding of former college roommates, BFFs and immediate family who came from far and wide -- Washington state, and California, Alabama, and Florida -- to celebrate at the Davenport House in Savannah. After the all-too-brief-but-charming ceremony conducted by a friend authorized as a notary, the crowd left en masse for the reception at a nearby restaurant, a buffet dinner in a private dining room.  Not like the 1950s, with our church weddings and parish hall receptions.  Mostly we married where we had gone to services all our lives, knew the minister, and members of the congregation, and where the restrooms were in the way back of the church.  And we had receiving lines.  After the pastor pronounced them man and wife, the newly married couple walked down the aisle with bridesmaids and groomsmen trailing behind, only to swing around and go back for the photographer to take pictures in front of the altar while guests waited for them to finish and form a receiving line in the parish hall, the bride and groom, his parents, her parents.  We shook hands, gave air kisses and congratulations to the groom, never the bride, and as soon as possible melted into the crowd to nibble on petit fours and finger sandwiches served by the bride’s friends, all decked out in formal gowns. We tried to sip on a cup of punch made from ginger ale over lime sherbet without sloshing it all over our wedding finery. We watched as the wedding cake was cut and the bride offered her groom the first bite. We waited impatiently for the bride to throw her bridal bouquet to the single ladies.  We painted ""Just Married"" in soap on all the windows of the newlyweds’ car and tied strings of tin cans to the rear bumper to make a racket as they drove away for their honeymoon.  And yes, we threw rice.  It was fun, and you didn’t need to take out a second mortgage to pay for it.  Oh, there were exceptions, elaborate receptions, unique, imaginative, like the time Robert and Dickie Roebling of Modena Plantation on Skidaway Island used their massive barn, built to house Aberdeen Angus cattle, as a wedding reception venue when their daughter Ellin married Donnell Watkins in 1950. With dinner tables in the stalls, champagne in feed troughs, and flowers in water buckets, plus an orchestra and buffet, it was quite an affair.  However, a wedding is a wedding.  Whether eloping at midnight to a justice of the peace over the state line, or indulging in a bizarre ceremony in a Las Vegas chapel, at the altar of a grand cathedral, or in a friend’s backyard, the questions remain the same.  Do you promise to love honor and cherish, For better or worse? For richer or poorer? Forever and ever?  Amen and amen.

"wedding","1972-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T11:00:00","He was the tallest usher in the famous wedding scene from “The Godfather.”  But actor Ron Gilbert was no fan of heavyweight actor Marlon Brando, who played Mafia chieftain Vito Corleone in the iconic gangster flick.  Gilbert, now 83, was born and raised in East Harlem and growing up knew the neighborhood wiseguys well.  “We had that vibe,” Gilbert told the Advance in a telephone interview.  He called Brando “a joke” for the less-than-dapper way that Brando dressed for the part of Don Corleone.  “If you were raised where I was raised, guys in the mob were very well dressed and very elegant,” he said. “We used to go to a barber shop and you’d see them being groomed.”  But Brando, he said, “was from a different world.”  “He looked like a monkey,” Gilbert said.  BRANDO’S SCRIPT TROUBLE  Gilbert, then 32, landed the wedding usher role after doing an off-Broadway play called “Rosebed.”  Gilbert, who took up acting after leaving the Army and studied at the famous Actors Studio, said that he had read the best-selling 1969 novel “The Godfather” before being cast in the film.  “We all read the book,” he said. “We felt it was a very powerful story. Gangster stories really work a lot.”  Gilbert, who also appeared in “The Usual Suspects” and numerous other films and TV shows during a long Hollywood career, said that Brando didn’t learn all his lines for “The Godfather.” During filming, he said, dialogue was stuck to the chests of other actors, written on the ceiling or on cue cards.  Movie historians say that part of the reason was because “Godfather” director Francis Ford Coppola was constantly rewriting the script and there was no time for Brando to learn the lines.  But according to Gilbert, Brando, another Actors Studio alum, “wanted everything to be natural.”  MOM’S WEDDING CAKE  The wedding scene was filmed at the so-called “Godfather house” at 110 Longfellow Ave. on Emerson Hill.  Many Staten Islanders were extras in the scene and the multi-tiered wedding cake was created by Oven Bake Shop in Port Richmond.  Gilbert said he spent three weeks on set and said that his brother still has one of the small dolls that decorated the wedding cake.  “I never had real lines,” he said of the scene. “I was there, walking around.”  He said he remembered jogging at a nearby school track during filming breaks.  Bride Connie Corleone was playing by Talia Shire, who was director Coppola’s sister.  Gilbert said that Shire considered the “Godfather” wedding cake to be her mother’s wedding cake because her parents, Carmine and Italia Coppola, had eloped.  From left, late Staten Island Advance photographer Tony Carannante, the late Jack Demyan and Bill Gertz with wedding cake from ""The Godfather."" (Staten Island Advance photo)Staten Island Advance  Carmine Coppola did music for all three “Godfather” films as well as for other Coppola movies including “Apocalypse Now.”  Gilbert said one peculiar restriction was in place while the wedding scene was being filmed.  “They didn’t allow us to dance,” he said. “We couldn’t dance with the women. It was kind of strange.”  Gilbert said that when not filming the wedding scene, he and other extras acted as “mob guys” in other “Godfather” scenes.  “All the extras were trying to get in front of the camera,” he said, adding that many of the background actors in the film were more mob-authentic than the lead players.  STILL GETS RESIDUALS  Gilbert said that a friend of his, Carmine Caridi, was in line to play hot-headed oldest Corleone son, Sonny, in the film.  But Caridi was nixed because, at 6-feet-3-inches tall, he was thought to be too tall to play opposite Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone and is listed at 5-feet-6-inches.  James Caan played Sonny and was nominated for an Academy Award.  Caridi, however, later played Carmine Rosato in “The Godfather Part II” and Albert Volpe in “The Godfather Part III.” He is one of only a handful of actors to play two different roles in the “Godfather” films.  Veteran actor Ron Gilbert played a wedding usher in the landmark 1972 gangster movie ""The Godfather."" (Photo courtesy of Ron Gilbert)  Gilbert also said that there was obvious on-set “tension” between Pacino and actress Diane Keaton, who played his wife, Kay Adams. The two met on the film and would soon embark on a decades-long, on-off, romance.  “They didn’t have to act,” Gilbert said. “There was real tension between them.”  Gilbert said he still gets residuals from the film. When the 50th anniversary of “The Godfather” was celebrated last year, Gilbert said he received $50.  His name is also included on the cast list of “The Godfather Trilogy,” he said.  “Over the years I have felt blessed to have been a part of that film,” he told Heart of Hollywood magazine.

When I first tried on my tux, I felt powerful and more like my queer self.  My Nanny's joy at seeing me and my partner in our tuxes helped me feel even more liberated.

When I came out as queer, it got harder. I started to question everything: Did I dress how I did because it was what I liked or because it was how I'd been told to dress in order to be desirable to men?  I realized patriarchal standards have been instilled in me since birth. Those standards are braided with my own need to be desired and loved.  But at 26, I wasn't dating a man, so I didn't feel the need to look feminine for the first time. I thought about how I genuinely wanted to present myself to the world.  I started small: a pair of short purple overalls, too loose to show off my breasts. I then went for sunset-colored Crocs, which a lot of people find ugly. Then it was an oversize orange-creamsicle button-up shirt — too masculine to make it into my former closet.  But when I wore a tuxedo to my family member's wedding, that's when I felt truly liberated.  When my partner's cousin got married, I couldn't stomach the idea of performing femininity as I'd done so many times before  By 2022, the rituals of dresses, makeup, and heels had grown foreign. The wedding was black tie, and my partner, a nonbinary trans-masculine person, decided they would be wearing a tuxedo. I wanted to join them.  When we walked into Men's Warehouse, the nice lesbian in a striped, collared shirt and tie met our eyes right away. She knew we needed her. She wrapped a measuring tape around my waist, found a shirt big enough to fit my chest, and gently pinned cuff links into my sleeves.  When I looked at myself in the mirror in the tux for the first time, it felt like my queerness and burgeoning gender queerness were announced to the world.  My feet were sweaty inside the stiff dress shoes, but I felt powerful.  Without my partner by my side, I usually passed as a straight girl, but in my tux, men would see me and know that I wasn't interested. Women would see me and not expect me to perform the usual rituals of cis-heterosexual femininity with them: the curling of hair, the complaining about boyfriends. Other queers would see me and know I was one of them.  I couldn't wait to see our grandmother's reaction when she saw me in my tux  My partner and I loaded our backpacks and garment bags into the car and made the two-hour drive from Philadelphia to the Baltimore suburbs where my partner's grandparents lived. When my own family couldn't accept me, Nanny and PopPop welcomed me into theirs as another grandchild with unprecedented ease, and we visited them often.  Nanny had always loved all things fancy. She was also a few years into her dementia diagnosis. She often didn't know she was in her own home, but she remembered that she loved us.  We planned to get ready at Nanny and PopPop's house, lugging our garment bags inside for a pre-wedding visit. With so much of the familiar now unfamiliar to her, anxiety and fear clouded her days. Maybe being part of our fancy day would bring her joy.  When we walked out of the guest room in our crisp tuxes and matching blue pocket squares, she gasped and beamed with joy.  ""This is just wonderful!"" she exclaimed, a soft hand thrown over her mouth. She thought we were getting married right then and there in her living room, and she was thrilled to be included.  Raised in Southern Baptist Christianity, no one in my family celebrates my queer love. So I'll never forget Nanny's hands clapping together and the grin that stretched across her face when she saw my partner and me in our outfits.  At the wedding, I felt truly myself in my tux  When we got to the wedding, most of our family only quietly tolerated our visible display of queerness. But it didn't matter. My partner and I weren't asking for their approval or excitement. We already had the celebration we needed.  At the wedding, we twirled and spun around on the dance floor, taking up our own space, being exactly ourselves — just the way Nanny liked us.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL3dvcmUtdHV4LWluc3RlYWQtZHJlc3MtZmFtaWx5LXdlZGRpbmctcXVlZXItMjAyMy010gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd29yZS10dXgtaW5zdGVhZC1kcmVzcy1mYW1pbHktd2VkZGluZy1xdWVlci0yMDIzLTU_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As the couple's fifth wedding anniversary approaches, we've taken a look at some stunning throwback photos of the mother-of-the-bride shared by the couple in their Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan. Released in December 2022, the series shared several never-before-seen glimpses inside the royal wedding, which took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.  WATCH: Meghan Markle kisses King Charles in sweet behind-the-scenes wedding moment  After exchanging vows in front of the cameras, the newlyweds hosted private receptions at Windsor Castle and Frogmore House where they could celebrate with friends and family away from the public eye. One black-and-white photo showed Doria front and centre of the crowd as Elton John performed on the piano.  While everyone gathered around to watch the famous singer, Doria appeared particularly lost in the music as she gazed at Elton dressed in her pale green Oscar de la Renta dress with a matching coat decorated with white floral embroidery. ""I couldn't find my mom because she had just beelined to the stage to watch Elton sing,"" Meghan laughed in the documentary.  More snaps of Doria show her arriving at the wedding ceremony with Prince Harry's ushers Thomas and Charlie van Straubenzee, kissing her new son-in-law on the cheek and raising her hand and cheering alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William at the wedding reception.  Doria and Thomas Markle got married in 1979, but they divorced in 1987 and continued to co-parent Meghan. Thomas was originally expected to attend the royal wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle, but just days beforehand he suffered a heart attack and told TMZ he was staying in America for an operation. ""They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,"" he said.  © Netflix Doria was spotted raising her hands at the wedding reception  At the time, Meghan released a statement which read: ""Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.""  © Getty Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married in May 2018  She later told Oprah Winfrey that she felt ""betrayed"" after it emerged that the retired lighting director had staged paparazzi photos ahead of the royal wedding.  ""When I asked him, he said, 'No, absolutely not [that he hadn't been talking to the tabloids],'"" Meghan revealed.  © Getty Doria Ragland looked beautiful in an Oscar de la Renta dress  But when she probed her father further, saying that she and Harry had offered to try and ""kill"" the news story if he was in fact telling the truth, Thomas wasn't able to say that he was. ""I said, I just need you to tell me and if you tell me the truth we can help. And he wasn't able to do that,"" said Meghan.  ""I genuinely can't imagine doing anything to intentionally cause pain to my child, so it's hard for me to reconcile that,"" she said.

It's been over four years since Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas married. They welcomed daughter Malti Marie Chopra Jonas last year in January. She was born via surrogacy. The couple has often spoken about the wedding. In a new interview, when asked 'why did you want it (her wedding with Nick) to be so big', Priyanka said the wedding was ‘big in scale’ but still 'very intimate'  She told CNN, ""Because I never said I was subtle. Everything I do is big. I am a bold person. It (the wedding) was big in scale, but it was just a 110 people. It was the closest people to me and my husband, and we kept it very intimate. But I wanted to get married in a palace, with a 75-foot train, why not?""  For the first Christian ceremony, Priyanka wore a custom Ralph Lauren gown that took a total of 1,826 hours to make – complete with pearls, beads, Swarovski crystals and a 75-foot train. The gown also had some special touches, including eight words in hand-stitched embroidery, which read: Nicholas Jerry Jonas, 1st December 2018, Madhu and Ashok, Om Namah Shivay (a Hindu mantra invoking Lord Shiva), family, hope, compassion and love.  For the second Hindu ceremony, Priyanka had worn a red lehenga by Sabyasachi Mukherjee. From Sophie Turner and then-fiancé Joe Jonas to Priyanka and Nick's parents, everyone attended the wedding in Rajasthan. The couple, who dated for seven months before marrying, had finished off the Hindu and Christian celebrations with wedding receptions in Delhi and Mumbai.  Priyanka, who now lives in Los Angeles with Nick and their one-year-old daughter Malti, was last seen in Love Again.

Justin Tyler Fox posted a TikTok video of his wedding ceremony, where he confessed to his wife-to-be, Raven, there was something special about her ring. The tiny little stone at the base of her massive engagement ring wasn’t just a regular accent stone. It was made out of her tooth!  During his vows, Fox thanked his bride for being there for him “after he figured it all out” and acknowledged her “deep doubled-sided dimples” and “beautiful soul.” In the video, he then asked, “Do you remember the day when I knew for a fact that I was going to marry you?” He proceeded to tell the story of how during a group hiking trip his adventurous bride attempted to follow his lead and jump across a creek.  While he made it across without a problem, Raven missed the jump and landed on her face, which resulted in her chipping her two front teeth. What could have been an embarrassing moment made the groom realize there was something special about his future wife.  The groom said the incident made him realize she would follow him to any place on Earth for every adventure and challenge they embark on together as husband and wife. “I just remember thinking that this girl has literally fallen for me,” he joked before revealing he took a “special stone” from their hike to remember that day and had it embedded into her engagement ring.  As he continued his vows, Fox said Raven asked him about the small embellishment at the time of his proposal. “You asked me, ‘What is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?’ … I told you, ‘No, that’s the way it’s supposed to be,’ and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day,” he said. “Here’s my confession. I picked that stone up from the top of the waterfall that day. I couldn’t leave it because it was as much a part of you as you are about to be a part of me — one flesh. Are you hearing me? That little stone in your ring is made out of dentin and enamel. Your dentin and enamel.”  Story continues  So far, the clip has received nearly 10 million views on TikTok, with viewers gushing over how unique and moving the groom’s vows and actions were. “If his vows ain’t like this I don’t want him 🥹🤣,” laughed @ncsquared. User @ingridsshenanigans commented, “i wish y’all an eternity!”  “These are the things that should be viral. pure genuine sentimental love. this is beautiful 💕,” wrote @lissmorales__.

Her dad Andre “Andy” Leroux was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two-and-a-half years ago and doesn’t have much time left.  “As he puts it, he’s on his way out,” Brittany said. “He was moved over to the palliative care unit and he’s making his journey to leave this world.”  She and her fiancé John Reh got engaged a while ago — but with two young kids, wedding plans just kept getting kicked down the line.  However, she says it dawned on her a few days ago she didn’t have much time if she wanted her father to be part of the special day.  She and John decided on Wednesday they would marry Friday in a small ceremony held on the grounds of the Hôtel-Dieu Grace Healthcare Centre in Windsor, so her father could come.  “I didn’t think it would come together, but it did,” said the bride.  She credits the support of her family and friends, as well as Transition to Betterness, the local charity helping keep her father comfortable, with making it all possible.  “It’s amazing what they did to help us have this day, so that I could have it with my dad before he passes,” said Brittany.  Her father, Andy, called it a “very, very exciting day.”  He said he was extremely happy to be able to be there to see it, and to see his family and friends at the ceremony.  “I’m so happy. It makes my heart tick real nice,” said Andy.  He brought his daughter down the aisle beaming with equal parts joy and pride – rolling along side her in his wheelchair.  Brittany said she had to be mindful of the moment, so as not to let it pass too quickly.  “I had to force myself to think about it and stop and stay in the moment,” she said. “I was looking around at everybody and then I had to stop and look down at my dad’s hand… it’s not the same hand that I grew up looking at. It’s withered and it’s worn. But in that moment I just thought… oh my God this is the best moment.

He said he knows John to be the type of person to do that for his daughter.  Linda Santos, office manager for Transition to Betterness, said they are all about comfort – but this is the first time they’ve been involved in a wedding.  “This is a first so we’re very excited,” she said.  Brittany and John were married in the Dr. Lisa Ventrella-Lucente Healing Garden outside the healthcare centre – a space that just opened last summer, named for the former Transition to Betterness board member who died in 2015.

Hucky says the association’s website has the resources homeowners need.  “There’s a very large list of people broken up by region local beekeepers that will come and assist you and take that hive off your hands, typically free of charge,” he said.  However, once the bees have found a quarter-inch hole or larger on the side of a home and move into the eaves or walls it can become pricey. There’s no set price within the industry and cutout services can range from a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.  Hucky said homeowners want to make sure they hire someone that understands the construction and has the proper tools for the job.  While someone’s first response to a honeybee swarm might be to grab the insect spray and kill the bees, Hucky said please don’t do it for a variety of reasons.  “If the spray was to kill the hive you still have all that brood and all that honey and it will be like having a large dead animal in the wall,” Hucky said. “If that hives been poisoned, you’re not only poisoning that hive you could potentially poison other hives in the area.”  He said other honeybees will pick up the scent left behind by the propolis in the hive and could visit the poisoned hive and then carry the pesticide to other hives in the area several miles away. The good news is while honeybees can swarm at any time, they predominately swarm between April and June, which means we’re about midway through this year’s swarm season.  If you find the need for a beekeeper to take care of a swarm in your area, visit the SWOBA website and click the ‘Swarm Removal’ link at the top of the page.  SWOBA’s President Yaser Almusawy encourages property owners to plant bee-friendly flowers. A list can be found on their website.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5qb3VybmFsLW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYmVlcy1zd2FybS1jaW5jaW5uYXRpLXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWUtMTAwLXllYXItb2xkLWZsb29yLW1pZ2h0LWJlLXRvcm4tYXBhcnQtdG8tcmVhY2gtaGl2ZS83WUVLQkxOTTZaSDVOR1pVT0pXTjY2WE9KUS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rosângela Rennó’s Wedding Landscape (1996) is made up of layers of large sheets of plexiglass, to which the artist glued strips of negatives she retrieved from a wedding photography studio in Havana in 1994. Before the work went on view in Chosen Memories, a survey of Latin American contemporary art currently on view at MoMA, our photography conservators made a routine assessment of the work’s condition. What they found—and the best way to treat it—turned out to be anything but routine.  “Materials of film are generally held in an archive. So they’re typically not put on display,” explains Craig Kamrath, a photography conservation fellow, “But in this instance, the film is what you’re there to look at, these strips of negatives.”  Photography conservator Lee Ann Daffner was baffled: “When I first saw this work, I didn’t know what to think, because we had so many questions.” For one, there was a white, powdery substance appearing throughout the layers of plexiglass. Was it mold, or the dreaded “plexi disease” that can occur when a piece of plexiglass abrades, or something else? Daffner and Kamrath worked with conservation scientist Catherine H. Stephens and conservation science fellow Kyna Biggs to take samples and analyze them. But then another problem presented itself: these negatives, made of cellulose acetate, have a limited shelf life before they begin degrading. Thorough detective work needed to be done to determine the age of the negatives and how much acetic acid they were off-gassing, a sign of their decay. And was the plexiglass helping or hurting their condition?  “We’re right on the doorstep with this artwork,” Kamrath said. The discoveries are constantly unfolding in our latest episode of Conservation Stories.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbWEub3JnL21hZ2F6aW5lL2FydGljbGVzLzkwM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Ahead of the seriously big party, Jamie and Sophie have been doing yoga and pampering themselves at the luxury wellness escape Palm Rocks Retreats. But what about all their guest travelling from the UK?  This is essentially the royal wedding of reality TV. So, in case you’re curious about who’s attending— here’s who’s on the invite list:  Spencer Matthews  Despite some serious drama over Spencer not being invited to Jamie and Sophie’s city wedding, he’s still supposed to be attending the wedding in Spain. Albeit without Vogue, who can’t make the second date and is super upset about it.  Sam Thompson  Another seemingly snubbed guest, Sam Thompson is also still jetting to the wedding in Spain despite also missing out on an invite to Jamie’s stag do. “I’m actually going to the wedding which is going to be sick,” he said on his podcast Staying Relevant. “I wasn’t invited to the stag do – that is a problem. I genuinely thought I was gonna go.  “I called him afterwards [the proposal announcement] and was like: ‘Mate this is so cool, where we are going for the stag’. And he was going: ‘Mate the stag’s gonna be sick we might do Miami’. He was like: ‘We’re gonna do some awesome stuff and I’ll let you know when we go’ and it turns out I saw it on Instagram. I have a bee in my bonnet about that, I genuinely do. I thought I was going.”  Alex Mytton  One man who was invited to Jamie’s stag do, Alex Mytton, is en route to Spain after just days back from his holiday in India. He’s got a big role in the wedding as an usher alongside Spencer. We’ll see if it all goes smoothly with those two in charge.  Jack Whitehall  Another posh boy heading to Sotogrande this weekend is Jack Whitehall, who chatted to Sam Thompson about the wedding on Hits Radio. “I’m terrified,” he said. “Is it going to be like being in an episode of Made in Chelsea? Can we have an argument and you chuck a drink in my face?”  Lottie Moss  Model turned OnlyFans content creator and sister of Kate Moss, Lottie is also on the list for Jamie and Habb’s second wedding. Over the last couple of days, she’s been posting Instagram stories hanging out with other Made in Chelsea cast as they get hyped for the ceremony.  Millie Mackintosh and Hugo Taylor  Millie and Hugo have been in Spain since Friday and have spent the pre-wedding period sunning themselves at the exclusive Puente Romano resort in Marbella. Millie revealed on Instagram how much she hated flying there, but it was nothing a bit of meditation and crystal holding didn’t sort out.  Oliver Proudlock  One of Jamie’s oldest friends, Proudlock, is confirmed to be attending the wedding. He hasn’t shared anything to his Insta yet but you just know he’s going to have such a slay outfit.  Melissa Tattam  Obv, Sophie’s Wednesday We Drink Wine co-host and best friend Melissa is involved in Jamie and Habb’s second wedding. She’s been in Sotogrande all week right alongside the bride and groom, getting her nails done, playing padel and working on her tan.  Olivia Bentley and Ruby Adler  Liv and Ruby posted stories from their Easy Jet flight to Spain this morning, with Louis Vuitton luggage in tow. Tristan won’t be joining them, though. After he and Liv broke up earlier this month, we’re guessing his invite was lost in the post. Savage.  Ollie Locke  Also on Liv and Ruby’s flight was Ollie Locke who looked super hyped for the big day. You already know he’s got good energy on the dance floor. Have slight FOMO.  Emily Blackwell  Alongside her boyfriend Jordan Alexander, Emily has been chilling by the pool in Sotogrande ahead of the wedding and has been making plenty of use of the spa, too. Dreamy weekend energy from her socials. Also, can’t wait to see her fit.  Caggie Dunlop  Another major MIC throwback, Caggie is also on the list for Sophie and Jamie’s wedding. Would pay good money to see her and Spencer in the same room again. Please. Where is the E4 crew when you need them?!

So Jackie made a deep side part, curled my entire head, and added some rhinestones. And just like that, I'm a bride!  Shoe changes:    Yes...wearing heels all day HURTS! Lauren says she's noticed a trend in brides opting for comfort during the reception with customized sneakers for brides and grooms too!  Luckily, comfortable shoes can still be cute and reflect your style. If athletic shoes aren't your thing, you can spring for a tennis shoe with glitter or lace details.

"wedding","2011-05-19","Not Discerned","{""London"", ""GreaterLondon"", ""UnitedKingdom""}","2023-05-19T14:58:24","There's no denying that Kate Middleton's big-day look made a lasting impression on the world of weddings. Her elegant Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen wedding dress put long sleeves back on the map and her barely-there makeup style set the standard for natural glam. In fact, many agree that the Princess of Wales—with her glowing complexion, a gray smokey eye, rosy cheeks, and pale pink lips—put the ""you but better"" bridal makeup trend on the map. “It was what we call ‘elevated natural,’” makeup artist Michelle Schultz, founder of Willow House Beauty, explains. “She looks special but still like herself. She enhanced her features rather than covered them up. Her skin looks perfect without being overdone. Her cheeks look naturally flushed with a pop of pink. Her eyebrows are defined—as well as her eyes—which make this natural look stand out.”  Meet the Expert Michelle Schultz is a makeup artist with 16 years of experience and the owner of Willow House Beauty.  What really set Kate’s look apart was that she took matters into her hands by reportedly doing her very own makeup. Ahead of her nuptials, the princess is said to have taken several private lessons with Bobbi Brown makeup artist Hannah Martin; the goal was for her to be able to expertly apply her desired look on the big day. Lucky for you, since Kate took a DIY approach to her glam, reproducing her fresh-faced complexion is very attainable, and that's true whether you do your own makeup or hire a professional. Although the royal bride is said to have used all Bobbi Brown products for her special day, you can tap any of your favorite brands to replicate her no-makeup makeup look.  If you’re obsessed with Kate’s timeless, understated glam and want to achieve a similar look on your own wedding day, we talked to a professional makeup artist to learn how to do just that. Ahead, the expert reveals a step-by-step process that’s easy to follow.  John Phillips / Getty Images  Step 1: Start With a Glowing Complexion  The secret to Kate’s effortless look is beginning with a flawless base. Schultz suggests using a medium-coverage foundation with a natural finish, such as Makeup by Mario SurrealSkin Foundation, to conceal imperfections without looking caked on. Then, she recommends applying a light concealer under the eyes to even out the skin tone and correct discoloration. According to the makeup artist, Tarte Shape Tape Concealer will accomplish this.  Step 2: Add Color to Your Cheeks  The Princess of Wales’ pink tint on her cheeks was the focal point of her soft glam. To duplicate the royal bride’s rosy look, Schultz advises adding a pink blush, like Dior Backstage Rosy Glow Blush, to the apples of your cheeks for a healthy, vibrant touch. Wondering how to find this spot on your face? Smile. The front parts that pop up are the apples.  Step 3: Define Your Eyebrows  Eyebrows are one feature you don’t want to overlook for your day-of glam. On Kate’s wedding day, her brows were full, groomed, and pronounced. To produce the same definition and fill in sparse areas, Schultz says to use an eyebrow pencil, such as MAC Cosmetics Eye Brows Styler.  Step 4: Create a Smokey Eye  Kate went with a gray smokey eye on her big day, which added a dramatic flair to her subdued look. According to Schultz, applying a bone-colored eyeshadow across your lid and up to the browline will create a bright base. Then, take a gray shade (or a medium-brown hue for a more subtle look) and swipe it across your crease. The end result? You’ll contour and define the eye shape, the makeup artist notes.  Step 5: Line the Eyes  “Eyeliner is a big feature for this look, so don’t be afraid to go bold!” Schultz remarks. Choose a liner in a dark tone, whether it’s brown, navy, or black, and line the upper lid and lower lid beneath your eyelashes with the product. For this step, the makeup artist suggests Make Up For Ever Aqua Resist Color Pencil. To make your eyes look bigger and brighter, she recommends using a white eyeliner, like NYX Cosmetics Jumbo Eye Pencil, along the waterline. Don’t forget to finish off the look with a waterproof mascara for fluttery, voluminous lashes.  Step 6: Apply a Faint Lipstick  The final step of Kate’s look is elevating the lips with a pink color featuring a satin finish. To mirror the bride’s pretty tint, Schultz loves NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil in “Sex Machine.” Before you apply the shade, consider locking in moisture with a hydrating lip balm. Once you’ve finished applying all of your cosmetics, spritz on a setting spray, so your look lasts all night.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20va2F0ZS1taWRkbGV0b24td2VkZGluZy1tYWtldXAtcmVjcmVhdGUtdGlwcy03NTAwMDQ30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-07-15","14:00:00","{""Chelsea"", ""UnitedStates"", ""female""}","2023-05-19T18:19:00","Chelsea flower show has long been a staple of the society calendar, with celebrities and royals making an appearance among the peonies and roses.  However, this year, the Royal Horticultural Society is trying to make the show – and horticulture – more inclusive, by putting on special events for children, and encouraging the creation of gardens with an accessibility theme.  For the first time in its 110-year history, a picnic for children will take place at the show, with attendees coming from 10 schools in the most disadvantaged areas of London. After the event finishes, some of the show gardens will be transported into the grounds of schools that lack green space, in the hope it sparks a love of the outdoors in children who otherwise have little access to nature.  Chelsea will also be hosting its first wedding, between the garden designer Manoj Malde and his partner, Clive Gillmor. They plan to tie the knot on Monday in the garden Malde designed for the show, which has a theme of unity and diversity.  Malde said: “It’s really important that people know the RHS isn’t just about their shows and gardens, it also does a lot in the community – then people will begin to understand that it’s not elitist.  Malde in the garden he has designed. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  “How on earth is anyone going to accuse the RHS of being elitist when they are going to have the first RHS Chelsea wedding between a gay Indian man and a gay Irish man? [The garden designer] James Alexander Sinclair is going to be the celebrant. I’m thrilled. We’ve had the outfits made in India and I’ve asked all the ladies in my family to wear saris, so it’ll be really nice to have that tradition as well.”  Malde’s garden will celebrate his heritage, with a colour scheme of orange and pink, marigolds used in Hindu worship, and colourful spices set out on a table alongside small oil lamps used at festivals and religious ceremonies. The garden will also feature Asian fruit and vegetables.  In the Great Pavilion there will be a display celebrating female gardeners; for the first time in the show’s history more designers are female than male.  The RHS’s director of shows and gardens, Helena Pettit, said: “It’s so important to us that gardening is accessible to everyone, so we are really pleased that this is such a strong theme running throughout this year’s show.  “It’s an ongoing project which will always need further work, but we have made a concerted effort to make sure RHS Chelsea flower show this year is demonstrably open.”  Staff prepare Horatio’s Garden which will be wheelchair accessible. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  Many of the gardens have themes of accessibility, including that of the charity Horatio’s Garden, which is designed to be wheelchair accessible. The charity creates accessible and sustainable gardens in spinal centres and this particular garden will be moved after the show to the Princess Royal spinal injuries centre in Sheffield.

Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  The Choose Love Garden is inspired by refugee migration routes across Europe and the concept of desire lines – paths created by usage where no formal routes exist. It will grow crops and herbs eaten by asylum seeker communities in the UK. The garden will later be relocated to Good Food Matters in Croydon, a community scheme that provides marginalised groups space and support to grow and cook their own food.  The Choose Love Garden. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  The School Food Matters garden is designed with children in mind. Paths will be child-sized, allowing them to create their own imagined worlds as they meander past plants and scramble over boulders surrounded by bright flowers. It is also full of crops, including radishes and beans, and it will inspire the creation of two gardens by the gardeners at schools in London and Liverpool.  The Memoria & GreenAcres Transcendence Garden is designed for bereaved people, with tall trees and flowing water aimed at creating a sense of peace.  The designers Amelia Bouquet and Emilie Bausager are making their RHS Chelsea debut with the Platform Garden. Inspired by unused overground station platforms in London, the garden, which features concrete bins as planters and novel ways to harvest rainwater, will eventually be installed at a nearby station.  Pettit said:“A requirement this year is that every garden lives on after the show, whether it be in a hospital, a school or a community space, so thousands of people will benefit from these gardens for years to come. For too long, gardening has not been as open as it should be to people from all walks of life, and we need to tackle this at all levels.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTkvZ2F5LXdlZGRpbmctYW5kLXNjaG9vbGNoaWxkcmVuLXRvLWZlYXR1cmUtYXQtaW5jbHVzaXZlLWNoZWxzZWEtZmxvd2VyLXNob3fSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbGlmZWFuZHN0eWxlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2dheS13ZWRkaW5nLWFuZC1zY2hvb2xjaGlsZHJlbi10by1mZWF0dXJlLWF0LWluY2x1c2l2ZS1jaGVsc2VhLWZsb3dlci1zaG93?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alfred Harrell offered his promise to his now-fiancée nearly a year ago. After winning the $150,000 jackpot -- from a scratch-off ticket -- his hopes for a dream wedding can finally come true.

"wedding","2023-05-13","14:00:00","{""Durban"", ""KwaZuluNatal"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-19T13:10:00","You've been invited to both a bridal shower and a wedding—congrats! It's always nice to know that friends or family members want you to participate in their special celebration and the events leading up to the big day. But one question guests are often faced with is whether you must purchase both a gift for the bridal shower and a gift for the wedding day.  If you're unsure about the proper etiquette around gift-giving during big wedding events, fear not. We ask an industry expert and etiquette extraordinaire all about the difference between bridal shower gifting and wedding gifts—and whether or not both are necessary for guests invited to both of these events.    Meet the Expert Diane Gottsman is an etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas in San Antonio, Texas.  Should I bring a gift to both the bridal shower and the wedding?  The short answer here is: Yes. Technically, these are two separate events, and traditionally, it is proper etiquette for guests to show up to the bridal shower with a gift, and also purchase a gift for the wedding (this is typically done via a wedding registry, but it's also fine to bring a present in-person to the wedding).  ""Since these are two separate occasions, and often the registry for both is different, sending or bringing a gift to each is appropriate,"" explains etiquette expert Diane Gottsman, owner of The Protocol School of Texas. ""It's best to send the wedding gift ahead of time so you don’t have to carry it to the wedding,"" she notes.  What if I can't afford to bring a gift to both events?  We're no stranger to the fact that being a wedding guest can get very pricey, very fast. Between gifts, buying or renting an outfit, attending pre-wedding events, and travel/accommodation costs, being a wedding guest is expensive—especially when you have multiple weddings a year. If you're feeling like you can't swing purchasing both a bridal shower gift and a wedding shower gift, it's most likely that the marrying couple will understand—your presence is the real present!  If you do find yourself in this situation and want to give the couple a gift for both events, Gottsman recommends dividing your gift budget in half and splitting it between two smaller presents. ""It’s all about how you spend your dollars on the gift,"" she explains. ""If you are invited to a shower, it would probably be uncomfortable to show up without a gift, and the same for the wedding,"" she says. ""However, spending a much smaller amount [each gift] and making them sentimental and meaningful—not expensive—is the key.""  Should I send a gift to the couple if I can't attend the shower or the wedding?  If you're unable to attend the shower or the wedding (don't forget to RSVP on time!), Gotssman advises that whether or not to still send a gift is a bit nuanced. ""It depends on the relationship you share,"" she says. ""If you aren’t a good friend or family member, and you aren’t planning on attending either one (or only attending one), you can just bring a gift to the particular celebration you attend,"" she explains. ""If you are a very close family member or friend, you can decide how you will feel the next time you see [the couple]."" By this, she means if you think you'll be stressed about whether they'd notice that you didn't send a gift in lieu of your attendance, you should send one. However, if you think the couple simply won't mind either way, then it's fine to pass on the gift.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYnJpZGFsLXNob3dlci1naWZ0cy12ZXJzdXMtd2VkZGluZy1naWZ0cy1ldGlxdWV0dGUtNzQ5OTg2NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T13:20:00","Every bride wants to look and feel their best on their wedding day, and luminous skin plays a big role in boosting day-of confidence. A flawless complexion doesn’t happen overnight, however, so many brides-to-be follow a detailed skincare regimen up to a year before they tie the knot to achieve this sought-after radiance. And while your pre-wedding beauty routine will vary depending on the person, one integral component for most is getting frequent facials. These spa treatments for the face guarantee a natural glow and a blemish-free base to let your wedding makeup products work their magic.  According to licensed esthetician Shannon Marks, most brides should start getting facials every month at least three to six months before the big day. “This will give the skin enough time to respond to the treatments and show improvement,” she explains. If you’re dealing with a certain skin concern, such as acne, hyperpigmentation, or fine lines and wrinkles, Marks recommends working with an esthetician even sooner and receiving more consistent treatment.  Regardless of your skin type, Kira Igbowu of Full Frontal Beauty & Esthetics suggests starting your facial regimen at least three months out. “Once we hit the three-month mark, a monthly facial is imperative as the focus should now be on hydrating, plumping, calming, and feeding the skin with all the yummy goodness it needs before the big day,” she says.  Since every bride has a different complexion and desire for their day-of skin, though, many facials are tailored specifically to their needs, which is why Marks advises everyone to do an in-person consultation ahead of starting any treatment. That being said, we talked to a handful of estheticians to get a rundown on the most popular facials for brides, the treatment process for each, and the end result. From acne-targeting treatments to hydrating ones, here are the best facials to get before your wedding day.  Meet the Expert Shannon Marks is a licensed esthetician with seven years of experience and is the owner of Shannon Lee Esthetics in New York City.  Kira Igbowu is the founder and chief skin therapist at Full Frontal Beauty & Esthetics in Brooklyn. She’s been working in the skincare industry for nearly 20 years.  Carol Dobson Zubrin is an organic esthetician and holistic facialist with more than 18 years of experience. She’s also the owner of Purity Organic Facials in San Luis Obispo and Templeton, California and Purity Organic Spa in Los Angeles, California.  Taylor Worden is an esthetician at Taylor Worden Skin in New York City who has been working in the skincare space for 10 years.  Collagen Facial  According to Everyday Health, a loss of collagen naturally happens as we age, leading to dull skin, uneven pigment, loss of volume, fine lines, and wrinkles. And since collagen is responsible for the skin’s structure and elasticity, a facial that increases this protein in our body is loaded with benefits for future brides. Specifically, with a collagen facial, you’ll be able to reverse any collagen loss and restore your skin’s vibrancy and youthfulness.  Organic esthetician Carol Dobson Zubrin offers a Phyto Collagen Renewal Facial, which incorporates a mask infused with plant collagen to reduce the appearance of unwanted lines and correct your skin tone. She shares that the treatment is a favorite with her clients because it’s perfect for any skin type and is often a go-to before significant events, including weddings.  HydraFacial  HydraFacials are another popular choice for brides-to-be. During this spa treatment, your esthetician will use a hydrodermabrasion device to cleanse, exfoliate, and extract your skin before delivering serums. Almost immediately, you’ll notice firmer and more hydrated skin, which is why this treatment has become a highly-requested choice. “A HydraFacial can improve the overall health of the skin, leaving it brighter and more radiant for the bride’s big day,” Marks says. The best part? Since the facial is pretty gentle, any skin type will be able to tolerate it. You can also customize it so that it targets your specific concern, whether it’s acne, hyperpigmentation, or dry skin, Marks adds.  LED Facial  During this facial, LED lights penetrate the skin, which allows the body to increase cell turnover and jumpstart the skin renewal process. As a result, this treatment boosts collagen production, decreases hyperpigmentation, reduces wrinkles, and fights breakouts, leading to more volume and radiance for any type of complexion. Zubrin suggests her Pure Luxury Facial Treatment if hyperpigmentation is one of your concerns. It uses red or blue LED light therapy combined with a collagen mask to conceal sun spots, heal the skin, and create an undeniable glow.  Radio Frequency Facial  Looking for a nonsurgical alternative to a facelift? Igbowu recommends including radio frequency into your pre-wedding facial plan. This treatment uses an electromagnetic device that generates heat to stimulate collagen and elastin production, which lifts sagging skin, according to the skin therapist. You’ll also notice a more youthful appearance, better texture, and fewer fine lines.  Microcurrent Facial  Another type of facial that guarantees similar results to a facelift is a microcurrent facial. Igbowu explains that this painless, non-invasive treatment uses low-voltage electricity to stimulate the facial muscles, creating a lifted, tightened, and toned effect. Not only are the results instantaneous, but this treatment will also prevent future sagging. It's also a great choice as it accommodates any skin type and requires zero downtime.  Lymphatic Drainage Facial  To Zubrin, a must-have facial for all brides is one that incorporates lymphatic drainage. “It’s a gentle, incredibly relaxing facial massage that drains toxins, bacteria, and chemicals that are collected in the lymph under the skin, toward the lymph nodes, so that your body can eliminate it, and new, fresh lymph takes its place,” she explains. “It’s my clients’ all-time favorite and the most effective treatment that I do.”  But what does this facial actually entail? A provider will use their hands or sculpting tools to gently massage the face, which increases circulation and rids waste, according to mindbodygreen. This movement also prompts the lymphatic system to heal, leading to an improvement in puffy, dry, dull, sensitive, or acne-prone skin.  Oxygen Facial  Our skin relies on oxygen to create new cells, and a lack of oxygen makes the skin look dull and drab. Enter: the oxygen facial, a go-to with celebrities, like Madonna and Ashley Graham. With this treatment, your provider will use a wand to deliver high-pressurized oxygen to the skin’s surface, according to Healthline. The end result? Less fine lines and wrinkles, a boost in blood circulation, and an increase in collagen production for clearer, softer skin. Generally, this type of facial is gentle, so any future bride will benefit.  Dermaplaning Facial  Dermaplaning is the latest buzzword in the beauty space, and it’s a favorable option for brides-to-be. This non-invasive facial treatment uses a scalpel to exfoliate the skin and remove peach fuzz and dead skin cells, leading to a brighter, softer, smoother complexion, according to Igbowu. “It’s painless, has zero downtime, and the results are immediate,” she concludes. Not to mention, dermaplaning allows serums and makeup products to penetrate your skin, delivering better results. Just a word of caution: If you have sensitive skin or are dealing with breakouts, this treatment has the potential to inflame your skin.  Chemical Peel  Although chemical peels often get a bad rap as harsh treatments that require a long recovery, Marks explains that VI chemical peels with medium strength are suitable for all skin types and concerns. This kind of peel contains ingredients, such as salicylic acid, vitamin C, and phenol, which remove dead skin and reveal a more youthful appearance and even skin tone. The esthetician mentions that it also fights acne and hyperpigmentation. “I love to perform this peel weeks prior to an event for that perfect glow the day of the event,” she says.  Custom Facial  Since no two brides have the same skin, a custom facial will suit your specific needs, concerns, and skin type. Every process is different, but usually, your esthetician will start by cleansing the surface of your skin, determining a treatment plan after a skin analysis, exfoliating the skin, removing impurities with extractions, and completing the facial with customized masks and serums, according to Marks.  Esthetician Taylor Worden explains that she only offers customized facials at her New York City-based spa, Taylor Worden Skin. Her treatments typically focus on lifting, depuffing, and hydrating through exfoliation, LED light, massage, microcurrent, and masks. Regardless of the type of facial your esthetician creates for you, though, your skin will look glowy and bright afterward.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYmVzdC1mYWNpYWxzLWJlZm9yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTc0OTg0ODbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Netflix star, 41, told E! News that the big day when she married the Australian musician, 29, won't be included in the show, the sixth season of which begins streaming Friday. (Season 7 has already been confirmed and begun filming.)  ""I think that it's a balance thing on a show like this, of what to share and what not to share, and I think that it is important that we are open and we shine a light on a love that I think is so beautiful,"" Stause said. ""But that being said, it's also important to keep some things for us.""  She added that the secret Las Vegas ceremony was ""imperfectly perfect,"" and that the couple hope to celebrate the same way, every year to come.  Megan Rasmussen  ""We promised we're going to just do it every year, whether it's another Vegas situation or somewhere else,"" Stause said. ""But just every year, something around the same time, spontaneous, fun, get everybody together and every single year, just celebrate.""  The real estate agent recently shared the details of her sweet and ""small"" wedding with PEOPLE.  ""It was a very small group there with us and some friends and family watching on a live stream,"" she told PEOPLE exclusively. The couple only gave those closest to them a heads up about their ""I dos"" in advance so they could tune in from afar.  Megan Rasmussen  For the ceremony, Stause wore a floor-length, pearlescent white gown by Gemeli Power and heeled sandals, and carried a bouquet of white roses. G Flip wore a suit by Melbourne-based designer E Nolan with a tie, sunglasses and white sneakers.  Following the ceremony, the newlyweds shared their joy via photos in front of the Las Vegas Strip sign and a graffitied wall that featured the words, ""Will you marry me?""  Stause later posted an Instagram reel that featured video snippets of her and G Flip enjoying time together.  ""Love doesn't always go as planned… Sometimes it's immeasurably better,"" Stause captioned the reel, which showed a picture of them married at the end.  The road to marriage was a year-long love affair for the two, who found themselves compatible despite coming from ""different corners of the world,"" G Flip recalled during an episode of the PEOPLE Every Day podcast.  ""We were both with our ex-partners [when we met] ... And then, we obviously separated from our partners, and we just started talking and stuff,"" they explained. ""We just found a lot of similarities, even though people would think we are from like different corners of the world. We find ourselves so similar sometimes.""  Even though their wedding won't be featured on the show, G Flip does make their Selling Sunset debut in season 6 alongside their partner.  When discussing being featured on the show with Vogue, they said, ""We could have kept everything quiet...""  ""But then … Then they win. They quiet you and take your voice,"" Stause cut in.

"wedding","2023-07-14","13:00:00","{""WestSpringfield"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T13:00:23","If you have one or more friends getting married this summer, you may be excited for their big day. But you may also be wondering how much of a blow your savings account is about to take.  Travel can be expensive at any time of the year. But during the summer, the cost can be even higher. And when you're traveling for a wedding, you don't get a choice when it comes to things like the timing or destination. So you could end up staring at a pretty hefty credit card tab after all is said and done.  The good news, though, is that there are steps you can take to lower your wedding-related travel costs. Here are some tactics worth employing, especially if money is tight.  1. Road trip it rather than fly  If you're attending a wedding, chances are, you have some friends in common with the bride and groom. If you're willing to hop in a car with those people and split the drive, you might save yourself money compared to the cost of a flight.  As an example, let's say your wedding destination is six hours away by car, so it's a reasonable drive for a weekend, especially if you can split it with another driver or more. If a flight to your destination has you shelling out $300 but the cost of driving is $150 all in, you'll save money even if you drive by yourself. But if you find two other people to road trip it with, you'll spend just $50 each.  2. Use the right credit card to book your flight  Air travel can be costly, especially if you want the option to be able to pick your own seat. But if you use a travel rewards credit card to book your flight, you might reap some savings along the way.  It's common for these cards to offer free checked bags on flights, for example. If you're attending a wedding and different festivities related to it, sticking to a carry-on may not be feasible. So if you don't have to pay to check a bag, that alone might save you a nice amount of money.  3. Bunk with a bunch of friends at a private rental  It's common for couples getting married to encourage guests to stay at the same hotel so everyone is centrally located. But staying at a hotel could be costly, especially if the wedding is being held at a popular destination. If you know other people attending the wedding, it could make more financial sense to split the cost of a private rental for lodging.  As an example, a 3-bedroom home that sleeps six in Hyannis, Massachusetts on Cape Cod costs $978 to book for the weekend of July 21 through July 23 through VRBO. A standard room at the Hyannis Inn that sleeps two that same weekend costs $753. (These prices include taxes and fees.)  So if you have a group of six traveling to the same wedding, you might spend $163 per person to split the cost of the $978 rental, versus $376.50 per person to stay at the hotel. And the VRBO property might also make it easier to cook some meals while you're away, thereby helping you save on food costs.  There's no question that attending a wedding can cost a lot when there's a travel component. But if you take these steps, you might manage to lower your costs and minimize the financial burden. And that should put you in a better frame of mind to celebrate with the people you care about.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzL3RyYXZlbGluZy1mb3ItYS13ZWRkaW5nLXRoaXMtc3VtbWVyLTMtd2F5cy10by1zYXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2019-05-11","Not Discerned","{""Petaluma"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T14:36:53","Eddie Kim and Yunha Kim first connected due to their careers. “We were both tech entrepreneurs who had started our own companies in San Francisco,” they share. “We met for coffee in August 2014 to network.” Two years later, Eddie took the plunge and asked Yunha out, propelling their friendship into an everlasting romance. When it came time for the proposal five years later, Eddie was ready to go all out. “Eddie had [long] had a vision of owning a ranch that would be a part of our entire life together,” Yunha shares. “Before proposing, he secretly purchased an undeveloped, off-the-grid, 27-acre parcel of land in Petaluma, California. He then planted a tricolor beech tree, meant to symbolize an important day in our shared life together: our engagement.” On May 11, 2019, he drove Yunha to the land, got down on one knee, and asked her to marry him in front of the tree. The answer, of course, was a resounding yes, and they celebrated back in San Francisco with a surprise engagement party the groom-to-be had secretly arranged.  The property, which they named Edna Ranch (a combination of their first names), would indeed become a major part of the couple’s life together. During the pandemic, they camped beneath the beech tree nearly every other weekend, and for their wedding, they wanted to “share this special place in our lives with all our closest family and friends,” the couple says.  Of course, this presented some challenges. ""Physically getting vendors onsite [was difficult],” says wedding planner Elise Johnson. “The property is accessible only through a series of one-way dirt roads, it had no physical address, and there was no cell reception or WiFi. Because the ranch is off-the-grid, it also has no water, no power, and no sewage.” Luckily, her firm had just the experience and vendor network to bring the bold vision to life—a vision that celebrated exactly that rustic nature. ""We wanted to echo the natural beauty of the incredibly special landscape, bringing in shades of green and wheat,” Yunha says. “Inspired by the tricolor beech, we incorporated a blind embossed beech emblem into the paper goods and kept all our colors neutral and soft like the local foliage.”  Ahead, see all of the naturally beautiful details from their May 21, 2022, wedding day, planned by Elise Johnson of Shannon Leahy Events and photographed by Larissa Cleveland.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  “Given my busy schedule as a founder and CEO of a tech startup, I had very limited time available to browse around and shop,” Yunha says of shopping for a wedding dress. “So, I hired a wedding stylist, Maradee Wahl, who helped me choose and tailor my wedding dress. She was amazing!” The vision was clean and simple but still, well, bridal. “I didn’t want to later regret not wearing a big wedding dress—which you only get a chance to wear once—so I chose one that was clean and chic, but at the same time feels like a wedding dress,"" she explains. A Reem Acra ball gown fit the bill.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Groom Eddie wore a navy Tom Ford tuxedo with a shawl collar. He accessorized his look with cufflinks gifted from the bride’s parents.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  As a nod to their shared heritage, the bride and groom’s mothers wore traditional Korean hanboks.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Carving out space for the ceremony was no easy feat. “We graded a rectangular portion of the land on Edna Ranch to make it flat enough to have the ceremony on,” the couple shares. “The ceremony location had views of the beautiful rolling hills of Petaluma.” Their hard work will continue to go to good use: The couple plans to use the flattened portion of the property to host future events. “We chose natural wood chairs and a low-profile stage framed by flowers ‘growing' from the ground; but the view was the real showstopper.”  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  A pair of adorable flower girls—and the couple’s nine-year-old Pomeranian, Omo, as ring bearer—led the procession before Yunha walked down the aisle with her father. “Our processional song was Pachelbel’s ‘Canon In D,’” the bride says. “We had a live quartet led by Eddie’s youngest sister, Esther Kim, who is a violinist; her partner Joseph Kaiser, a cellist; and two of their friends who play professionally with the San Francisco Ballet and Opera orchestras.”  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  They asked their pastor, Will Moraza of Epic Church, to officiate, and wrote their own vows. “Our recessional was to ‘Our Song’ by Taylor Swift, a song we both love and went well with the rural vibes.”  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  “We wanted our guests to not just witness us getting married on the ranch, but also to enjoy a tour of it,” the couple says. “To accomplish both, we carved a large circular walking path around the 27-acre ranch. Guests would arrive and make a big clockwise loop around the ranch as they walked to the ceremony, cocktail hour, then reception. Along the way, they could observe the tree that marked the spot where we got engaged.”  To make guests comfortable while also respecting the rural nature of the land, they erected sailcloth tents at the cocktail hour and reception spaces. And, there was one more surprise on the grounds. “Yunha is an animal lover, and we’re on farmland, so we brought in a petting zoo for the kids—and adults!—to enjoy during cocktail hour.”  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  “Eddie loves cajun food and Yunha loves Korean food,” the couple shares. “During cocktail hour, we served crawfish tostadas, catfish po’ boy, boudin balls, bulgogi mushroom lettuce cups, and salmon nigiri, and had roving oyster shuckers. It was an interesting mix, but it worked well!” They leaned into local for the alcohol selection, serving Petaluma-based beers like Lagunitas and Henhouse and wine from Azari Vineyards and McEvoy Ranch.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Their 175 guests then stepped into the largest tent for the reception. “Tables were draped in soft sage linens, and the chairs were reminiscent of tree branches,” the bride describes. “The motif was continued on the poles in the tent, where our florist actually built ‘trees’ on each pole; and the lighting team projected shadows of ancient oaks onto the rooftop of the tent and the dance floor.”  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Incongruent with the sophisticated place settings—in the best way possible—dinner was ultra casual. ""We share a passion for In-N-Out burgers,” the couple says. “Instead of the standard wedding dinner fare of fish or steak, we opted to serve In-N-Out-style burgers and fries with milkshakes. Each burger was wrapped with paper that said ‘Yunha-N-Eddie.'’’  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  The process of putting together a wedding is just as memorable as the wedding itself.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  “Instead of a traditional wedding party walk-in for the reception, we decided to open the reception with a musical performance by the entire wedding party,” the couple says. “The words of ‘I Can Hear the Bells’ from Hairspray were rewritten to tell the story of how Eddie pursued Yunha and ultimately married her.” It was one of their favorite memories of the day. “More than the performance itself, it was the months of rehearsing together with our closest friends that we remember. Yunha’s friends didn’t all know Eddie’s friends super well, and the rehearsals were a great way for everyone to get to know each other; everyone became a lot closer by the end of it. It made us both realize that the process of putting together a wedding is just as memorable as the wedding itself.""  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Their first dance was a nod to the venue they’d built together, “From the Ground Up” by Dan + Shay. “We waltzed to this beautiful country song about building a life together,” the couple shares.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  The bride changed into a sparkly cocktail-length frock by Monique Lhuillier to get the party started, but before everyone hit the dance floor, the bride and groom made sure that there was also an opportunity for guests to relax. “Yunha is the founder and CEO of Simple Habit, the maker of the Simple Habit meditation app and Sleep Reset, so we created a secret outdoor meditation lounge hidden deep in the woods for guests to hang out in.”  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Back inside the reception tent, the wedding party’s musical entrance wasn’t the only surprise dance—and the next one nearly went viral on TikTok. ""Yunha and her father first started waltzing to a beautiful song called ‘I Loved her First’ by Heartland,” the couple recaps. “In the middle of the waltz, the record scratches and suddenly ‘Gangnam Style’ starts playing. Yunha and her father donned sunglasses and start3e doing the Gangnam Style dance in perfect sync with each other. It was a complete surprise and the audience went wild!""  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  More of the couple’s favorite foods provided late-night fuel. “We had a Shin Ramyun station, where we served individual cups of spicy ramen with hot water, a big pot of kimchi jjigae—Korean kimchi stew, Yunha’s favorite dish—and spicy tteokbokki skewers.""  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  “After the last song—‘Have It All’ by Jason Mraz—played, the entire wedding party camped on another section of the land,” the newlyweds reminisce. They’d built a small campsite with a dozen Shelter Co. tents for the wedding party to stay in, a nod to their own love of camping. “Everyone was sitting around the campfire, talking about how much fun they all had. It was nice to share an intimate evening together after the festivities ended. In the morning, we cooked breakfast using some portable stoves and cried as we said goodbye.”  The couple's biggest takeaway? “Our guests all told us that the most memorable parts of the wedding were the parts that were nontraditional: the musical wedding party entrance, serving burgers and fries for dinner, camping in tents afterward,” Eddie and Yunha share. “We were a little nervous that these things wouldn’t ‘work,’ but they all turned out to be big hits and the things that everyone still talks about. So, our advice is to examine every part of your wedding and think of ways to do something out of the ordinary.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1yYW5jaC13ZWRkaW5nLTc0OTk0NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 mph in a 25 mph zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety. According to the toxicology report, Komoroski's blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit.  An attorney for Komoroski shared a statement after her arrest, saying: ""We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies.

(AP) — Aric Hutchinson wishes he could remember the crash, but he said he does remember his bride’s last words to him before the golf cart carrying them along a South Carolina beach road from their wedding reception was hit by a car driven by a woman who authorities say was drunk.  “The last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end,” he said in an interview broadcast Friday by ABC’s “Good Morning America.”  The bride, Samantha Miller, 34, was killed in the April 28 crash and Hutchinson and two other passengers were injured. A toxicology report showed the driver of the car, Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, had a blood alcohol level of 0.261 — over three times the legal limit. She is charged with reckless vehicular homicide and three counts of driving under the influence causing death or great bodily injury. Komoroski is currently being held without bond at a local jail, according to Charleston County Sheriff’s Office online records.  In a statement, Komoroski's defense attorneys, Chris Gramiccioni, Deb Gramiccioni and Nathan Williams, asked the public not to rush to judgment.  ""Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light,” they said.

Where’s Sam?’ and that’s when she told me there was an incident and that Sam didn’t make it,” he recalled.  Hutchinson remembers Miller’s calmness on their wedding night despite all the stresses of wedding planning. Family and friends came from all over the country and everyone, including Miller, was so happy.  “I’m still trying to wrap my head around it, that night, going from an all-time high to an all-time low,” he said. “It’s pretty rough to try to comprehend.”  Being back at the home he and Miller shared is hard, “but also nice,” Hutchinson said.  “It’s got Sam written all over the house,” he said. “So it’s nice to be here and have good memories.”  Hutchinson said he doesn’t have anything to say to Komoroski at this time.  “I can’t right now,” he said. “I’d like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.”  In addition to the criminal case, Komoroski faces a wrongful death lawsuit alongside several businesses accused of overserving her on the night of the crash.  Four bars gave “copious amounts of alcohol” to a “visibly intoxicated” woman — Komoroski — last month before she drove 40 mph (64 kph) over the speed limit into a golf cart carrying the couple away from their wedding reception, according to a new lawsuit filed Wednesday by Hutchinson and his relatives.  A taqueria that had recently hired Komoroski is accused of negligence and recklessness. An unnamed Taco Boy supervisor coerced the new server into consuming “a dangerous amount of alcohol” at an employee function before the crash, according to the complaint.

In an interview with ABC, Aric Hutchinson broke down as he struggled to recall the incident that killed Samantha Miller, 34, and severely injured him moments after they left their wedding reception in South Carolina last month.  “The last thing I remember her saying is she wanted the night to never end,” Hutchinson told Good Morning America (GMA).  Miller died after Jamie Lee Komoroski crashed into the golf buggy the newlyweds were using on a beach road close to the reception venue, causing it to roll over several times. Investigators say Komoroski was driving at 65mph in a 25mph zone, and had blood alcohol levels three times higher than the legal limit.  Miller, from Charlotte, North Carolina, died at the scene.  “I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. That night going from an all-time high to an all-time low, it’s pretty tough to try to comprehend,” said Hutchinson on GMA, but declined to comment on Komoroski.  Hutchinson suffered a brain injury, two broken legs and several fractures in his back and face. He recently returned home to the couple’s apartment after multiple surgeries. Miller’s brother and nephew, who were in the golf cart, were also injured.  “I remember waking up foggy, out of sorts. I could see my mom’s face and could tell something was wrong. ‘Where’s Sam, where’s Sam?’ I asked her. That’s when she told me there was an incident and Sam didn’t make it,” Hutchinson told GMA.  On Wednesday, Hutchinson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Komoroski and several local bars and restaurants where she had allegedly been drinking before driving. He is also suing Komoroski’s employer and supervisor, accusing them of pressuring her to consume excessive amounts of alcohol. In a statement to ABC, her employer said Komoroski had just started training and “there was no officially organized employee function around drinking”.  Komoroski has been charged with reckless homicide and three DUIs. She faces up to 25 years in prison for each DUI. Her attorneys have urged the public “not to rush to judgment”.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2JyaWRlLWtpbGxlZC13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LWdyb29tLXJlYWN0aW9u0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTkvYnJpZGUta2lsbGVkLXdlZGRpbmctbmlnaHQtZ3Jvb20tcmVhY3Rpb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T03:25:55","The internet is on the fence about a bride’s way of saving a little matrimonial money.  On May 14, TikToker Madison Mulkey (whose username is fittingly @brideisapersonality), posted a video that has ignited a debate on wedding fare and staff compensation. In it, Mulkey explains how she pulled off major savings on her Savannah, Georgia wedding by catering the reception with takeout from Chili’s.  “We served Chili’s at our wedding and this is how much we spent,” Mulkey begins the video, which has garnered more than 1.5 million views. “Our total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests.”  Get Tri-state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.  Mulkey says the order included gluten- and dairy-free specialty meals, and accomodated folks who had special requests, like a preference for seafood and more.  “So let’s talk about what went into serving Chili’s at our wedding,” she says. “First of all, we loved the price point, I mean, really can’t beat that price point. ... It’s insane that we only spent that much money for our wedding food.”  Mulvey then explains that her wedding party had to do a “lot of work on the back end” that they didn’t expect, including picking the food up at 11 a.m. when the reception was at 6 p.m. because they didn’t want to pay for delivery fees on the day of the event, which happened to coincide with St. Patrick’s Day.  Mulvey says an aunt who works in food service was tapped to handle transport and set the food up, writing sticky notes showing staff how to cook things appropriately so no one got sick. “Normally, when you order from Chili’s, they deliver it … they set it all up. It’s already made, people can just serve,” she says, adding that because of this, they had to figure out how to keep the food fresh until serving time.  “We had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking, and my coordinator kind of had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn’t really supposed to do and they weren’t supposed to do either,” Mulvey says. “But everyone made it work.”  Mulvey ends her video by noting that her situation was rare.  “I’m sure if you order from Chili’s in any other regard, like, they would serve it and it would all be so hassle-free,” Mulvey says, adding that she and her guests thought the food was amazing, listing chicken tender sliders, egg rolls, chips and salsa, Cajun chicken pasta and salad as items on the menu. “I mean, it was the perfect meal for our wedding. I’m so happy we chose Chili’s. So happy we did this!”  Mulkey did not immediately respond to TODAY.com’s request for comment.  While some of the comments for her video were supportive, many others contained follow-up questions.  “Normalize this! Weddings are so out of control. Such a great idea!” wrote one TikTok user.  “My sister got married in March and spent like $10,000 on the food and it suckkkkeddd lmao should’ve gotten chilis,” another person wrote, to which Mulvey replied, “Wedding food is so expensive!”  “Michael Scott type wedding catering,” another commented, referencing the famous “The Office” character who has a somewhat populist approach to food.  “All I can think abt is how stressful this must have been for the staff,” one TikTok user noted.  “I would cry if I came into work as a to go specialist and had this to do along with the rest of my orders. AND WITH NO TIP,” wrote another.  “I hope you generously tipped your servers for the extra unplanned work & got a nice gift for your aunt!” a TikToker commented, to which another replied, “Considering they weren’t willing to pay $300 for delivery and didn’t tip the staff at chilis I doubt it!”  “Please tell me you tipped,” commented someone else.  So many folks asked about whether or not Mulvey tipped her staff for the unexpected extra work that she uploaded a follow-up video a day later responding to their concerns.  “This video gained a lot of traction, which means it gained a lot of misunderstanding, which is fine, I can’t correct and reply to every comment. But here are a few things I want to say,” Mulvey says in the TikTok.  “We tipped everyone — we tipped the Chili’s kitchen staff $300, we tipped the Chili’s manager who worked specifically with us to make sure this was even possible $100,” she continues, claiming that she tipped her coordinator and servers in addition to paying them a “hefty” hourly fee.  Chili's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  “We really felt it was important to make sure that we were compensating everyone for their help, their work, the time that they spent doing their job, the work that they had to do at the wedding,” she says.  Mulvey ends her update by reiterating that the staff didn’t have to set everything up, but make the food, help the buffet run efficiently and then clean up.  “I didn’t ask anyone to work outside of their bounds or their means,” she says. “We were really respectful with everyone who was a part of our wedding day.”  Even with the update, TikTok commenters had even more questions, some which the bride responded to.  “Genuinely curious here, after paying the extra for people helping out… Would it have been cheaper to have Chili’s deliver it after all?” asked one commenter.  “Girl why are you back tracking, you already said in comments that you didn’t tip lol,” wrote another. Some viewers alleged she deleted a comment on the original video saying she hadn't tipped.  “I’m snitching …. Chilis managers aren’t allowed to get tips,” another user claimed, to which Mulvey responded, “Maybe they didn’t take it, I have no idea what they did with it. We gave chilis a lump sum.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXd5b3JrLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYnJpZGUtc2VydmVkLWNoaWxpcy1hdC1oZXItd2VkZGluZy1hbmQtcGVvcGxlLWhhdmUtbWl4ZWQtZmVlbGluZ3MtYWJvdXQtaXQvNDM0OTk5My_SAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3eW9yay5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2JyaWRlLXNlcnZlZC1jaGlsaXMtYXQtaGVyLXdlZGRpbmctYW5kLXBlb3BsZS1oYXZlLW1peGVkLWZlZWxpbmdzLWFib3V0LWl0LzQzNDk5OTMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This bride-to-be learnt about a devastating secret that her fiancé and her sister had been keeping from her just a few weeks before her wedding day.  A 28-year-old woman, who is engaged to her 36-year-old fiancé (D), took to Reddit to share the secret that has in fact caused her to break off the wedding. “After a family dinner this weekend, my sister, K who's 32 years old, suggested the two of us go out for some dessert alone. It was a strange suggestion for her to make as we were never really close, but I agreed. However, she simply drove us to a nearby park, where she dropped the bombshell on me that she and D went out for a while,” shares the bride-to-be. She does, however, add that this had happened before she ever met her fiancé .  “They went on dates for about a month but it fizzled out, and she repeatedly reassured me that nothing happened between her and D for the two years D and I were together. “Also, according to her, after I introduced D to my entire family (about three months into our relationship), she had a discussion with D, hoping D would break it off with me himself. However, D convinced her to simply hide it, as he was happy with me and their short fling shouldn’t interfere with our relationship,” she adds. The bride-to-be shared that she felt disgusted and betrayed.  “My sister is very non-confrontational and I can understand why she wouldn’t want to be the one to tell me, but I’ve been with D for over two years, and lived with him for almost a whole year. “When we got home, I blew up at him in front of our families, for having kept such a large secret from me and broke off the wedding. He’s tried to explain that his fling with my sister meant nothing, but I still believed he should have told me, and this has made me doubt if he has any other secrets he’s been keeping from me,” the Reddit user continues. “Since then, he, along with his mother and sister, have been persistently bombarding me with calls and texts. They wanted me to go on with the wedding, telling me that D has proved again and again how much he loved me, that the arrangements have all been made and we can’t get our deposits back, and that I would be letting down our wedding guests.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2xvdmUtc2V4L3JlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMvYnJpZGUtdG8tYmUtY2FsbHMtb2ZmLXdlZGRpbmctYWZ0ZXItZmluZGluZy1vdXQtdGhhdC1oZXItc2lzdGVyLWFuZC1oZXItZmlhbmNlLWhhZC1hLWZsaW5nLThjMmM0ODYzLThjYTctNGIwOS05YjU3LTNkZmY2NTExNGNmMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The anonymous woman shared her bizarre post-wedding woes on social media detailing how her husband’s mother also threw away the boxes the presents came in and had re-arranged the kitchen while she was house-sitting.  The new wife revealed her spouse's mum called to ask if she help around the home in any way while the pair were on their romantic getaway in Italy. But after being told that all she needed to do was swap some bowls and put out their new toaster, the mum ""completely overstepped"" and took it upon herself to open all of the couple's wedding presents. And to make matters worse, the woman's mother-in-law also re-organised the entire kitchen, which has left the woman feeling ""overwhelmed"" as she now can't find anything - and some of her sentimental items have been thrown away.  The anonymous woman shared her story on Reddit  In a post on Reddit, the woman vented: ""My mother-in-law tried to 'help' and completely overstepped. She and my father-in-law opened every single wedding present my husband and I received, threw every box away, and proceeded to re-organise the entire kitchen. I feel so violated while also feeling so overwhelmed by the task of trying to get things back to how they were. ""She called the day after our wedding while we were leaving the house for an overnight flight to Italy and asked how she could help. We said one task we have been avoiding is swapping out all the old plates and bowls for new plates and bowls, and maybe swapping out the old toaster for the new toaster. (I just wanted them to swap the upgrades). ""She opened every single wedding present and basically threw away every single box in the entire house. I can't return a single thing. (If I CAN return it, I'll have to purchase a vessel to transport the item in). She re-organised my whole kitchen and now I can't find anything.

The woman added that she now feels ""depressed"" whenever she looks at her kitchen and feels stressed at the thought of having to write thank you cards for presents she didn't even get to open herself. Commenters on the post were sympathetic toward the woman, with many urging her to cut all contact with her mother-in-law if she refuses to apologise for overstepping. One person said: ""This is so heartbreaking! They absolutely need to apologise - genuinely. They need to feel remorse for what they did. Even then it won't be good enough. It just won't. Change the locks. Don't let them come over for a long, long time."" While another added: ""I would NEVER speak with her again or let her in our house. This was your house, your stuff, your space.

We met at the Culinary Institute of America in New York. We love cooking and baking. We love to be able to share our creations,” Deborah Kim, the co-owner of Lady Camellia at the Waterfront, said in a recent interview.  Prior to coming to Alexandria, Kim and her husband Han founded Macaron Bee in Georgetown in 2012. For several years, they served macaroons and other pastries. They added tea to the mix a few years later. When they sought a new location for a new venture, they fell in love with Old Town. The location at 229 Strand Street serves afternoon tea, macaroons, sandwiches, champagne and more.  Kim described the new location as a perfect fit.  “It’s been really amazing. It’s been such an honor,” Kim said.  Lady Camellia is open Tuesday through Sunday with varying hours. Kim said they hope to be a space for connection and celebration in the community. The Old Town site can seat up to 40 individuals for private events.  “For a smaller event, we have a room that can be closed off into a private section. We can accommodate up to 18 in that space. And we’re currently working on an outdoor seating section that will have a slightly different concept,” Kim said.  Tea, scones and sweets have long been quintessential cuisine for a luncheon to toast a bride. The elegant ambiance of Lady Camellia serves as an ideal spot to celebrate with close family and friends ahead of the big day.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vYWxleHRpbWVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L2hpZ2gtdGltZS1mb3ItaGlnaC10ZWEtYS1uZXctcmVzdGF1cmFudC1vbi1vbGQtdG93bnMtd2F0ZXJmcm9udC1zZXJ2ZXMtdXAtd2VkZGluZy1pbnNwaXJhdGlvbi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is almost exactly five years since they tied the knot in a fairytale wedding at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Since then, their lives have taken a very different path from what would have been expected - with the couple quitting royal life for California while Harry is barely on speaking terms with his older brother Prince William.  It was on the wedding day on May 19, 2018, that William stood by his brother's side as he welcomed bride Meghan down the aisle before saying 'I do'.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  But the night before the nuptials, Harry has since revealed he was left ""feeling sick"" following a tense chat with William.  In his memoir Spare, Harry recalls having drinks with friends at Coworth Park Hotel, where he stayed the night before his big day at Windsor Castle.  He claimed William, who had just become a dad for the third time, had been due to join them but he cancelled at the ""last minute"" citing ""Kate and the kids"".  Image: AFP/Getty Images) AFP/Getty Images)  He then goes on to say that he reminded William that it was their tradition as the night before the now Prince of Wales's wedding, the pair had dinner together ahead of greeting the crowds.  Harry claims William asked: ""Why are you even saying hello to the crowds, Harold?""  To which Harry in response admitted in the book: ""I felt sick about it.""  Image: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)  However, Harry did concede that William eventually changed his mind about greeting the crowds and did agree to join his brother, as the Duke of Sussex wondered: ""Maybe Granny intervened"".  Harry says he pressed William about having dinner together and staying the night - and eventually, he relented and agreed to dinner, but wouldn't be staying over, reportedly telling his brother ""Sorry, Harold. Can't. Kids.""  It's unknown how Harry and Meghan will exactly be celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary tomorrow.  The traditional gift to give for five years of marriage is wood, so it's a possibility that the couple will exchange gifts made from the material on Friday.  It is also likely they will be marking the day privately, probably with their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.  Prince Harry's memoir Spare became the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever when his tell-all tale criticising the royal family was finally published earlier this year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFscy9wcmluY2UtaGFycnktZmVsdC1zaWNrLXByaW5jZS0zMDAxNDk4MNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFscy9wcmluY2UtaGFycnktZmVsdC1zaWNrLXByaW5jZS0zMDAxNDk4MC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Teresa Giudice‘s husband, Luis “Louie” Ruelas, opened up about why he decided to talk to her ex-husband, Joe Giudice, on their wedding day — and revealed what the pair discussed.  “I called him, basically just let him know that everything’s gonna be OK — that we’re a team,” the entrepreneur, 49, exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “It felt right to call him and talk to him, because he’s a good father. He definitely makes lemonade outta lemons, and it’s something that people don’t see out there. And I just wanted to acknowledge that for him.”  Teresa and Joe, both 50, called it quits in 2019 after 20 years of marriage and finalized their divorce one year later. The former couple, who tied the knot in 1999, share four daughters: Gia, 22, Gabriella, 19, Milania, 17, and Audriana, 13.  Louie explained that he wanted to reach out to Joe to let him know he planned to be “all hands on deck” with the girls. The businessman has a similar relationship with his ex-wife, Marisa Dimartino Ruelas, with whom he shares sons Nicholas and Louie Jr. Last year, Marisa joined her ex-husband and Teresa in Atlantic City to celebrate Louie Jr.’s birthday.  “We spent the weekend together, we went out for some dinner, and it was so nice,” the Real Housewives of New Jersey star recalls to Us. “It was a fun night. It was really nice.”  The Dancing With the Stars alum adds that she and her husband plan to visit Joe in the Bahamas again soon after previously having dinner with him and the kids. That get-together, she notes, was Louie’s idea.  “I’m so happy we did [it],” Teresa says of the rendezvous. “It made my daughter so happy. And I was like, ‘Thank you so much for doing that.’ It wasn’t my idea, it was his. So [Louie] gets to take the credit for it. But then after I did it, I’m like, ‘Thank you,’ because they really made the girls so happy.”  The Turning the Tables author and Louie tied the knot in August 2022 after getting engaged one year prior. A special documenting their wedding, Teresa Gets Married, is set to air on Bravo Tuesday, May 23.  “It was kind of like a fairy tale,” Teresa tells Us of the big day. “It was the wedding I’ve always wanted. It was just more than I could dream for.”  Louie, for his part, adds that the couple have been enjoying married life as they approach their first anniversary. “Real life for us has been amazing,” he explains. “Waking up with your partner. … When you’re in the right [relationship], you kind of know it.”  Despite their hectic schedules, the duo still try to have dinner together every tonight with the kids. “It’s actually really beautiful,” Louie says. “We have time to focus on the children and what’s important, where they’re going, what their next steps are.”  Teresa Gets Married airs on Bravo Tuesday, May 23, at 9 p.m. ET.

Georgina Mitchell, 33, claims that the ""negative and unfair"" word - meaning a woman to be wed who becomes unpleasant to deal with - is being phased out.  Instead, the term is being replaced by ""main character bride"" - a much more positive figure, Georgina says. The wedding planner, who has been in the business for 12 years and got married herself last year, added: ""It's like that nightmare employee has become the boss and all is well.  ""Bridezilla is such a negative and unfair term. It was basically about brides crying out to be heard because it's their special day. But they were so disempowered by other people paying - like gifts with strings attached.  ""If we go right back then women were moving families - the passive bride who was given away. That evolved into bridezilla, it was her big day but she didn't own it.  ""Now brides are the main character. They pay for the wedding and can have what they want without a fight. I call her the main character bride. She’s basically, 'This is what we’re doing - come if you want. She's only answerable to her partner.""  Georgina gives daily tips on Instagram and TikTok and hosts a wedding-themed podcast. She says the cost of a big day has risen in recent years, with the price of a photographer more than doubling - as people want social media ready content.  But modern weddings are generally smaller and more often held outside, she added. There has also a shift away from the groom's side and the bride's side as modern families are structured differently, Georgina said.  Brides are also opting for two dresses now - the long train in the day then often changing into a short, party dress for the evening. And food is no longer a sitdown, served meal, but more likely street food vans, and pie and mash is a popular option, she said.  ""Weddings are a lot more informal now,"" she went on. ""Couples just want their friends and families to come along and have a good time. Social media has generated a lot of the change I think.  ""Now people use it to get ideas, and they realise they're not alone when they want to go for a non-traditional option. The cost of photographers is eye-watering now. I'd say around £2,000 on average.  ""The biggest change is that couples are doing it their way because they don't feel beholden to anyone else. They can pay for it themselves so they can do what they like.  ""I’ve known a couple to be given £20,000 for their wedding but it came with so many stipulations that they gave it back. They were told who to invite, what kind of wedding to have, what the colour scheme would be.  Georgina and husband Brian, 33, a personal finance influencer, had their legal wedding at a registry office two weeks before another ceremony and party on New Year's Eve. Her dress was fitted with a long train, and there was no cake - instead guests got to make their own cocktails.  Georgina worked on weddings in her roles at a golf club, a hotel, and with an outdoor catering company before setting up her own business, Georgina Rose Events in Gloucester in 2020.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLXdvcmxkLW5ld3Mvd2VkZGluZy1leHBlcnQtc2F5cy10ZXJtLWJyaWRlemlsbGEtODQ0OTI5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Well, in an interview with a news portal, the actress opened up about her wedding arrangements and moreover her wedding outfit. Scroll down to read it.  Amrita Rao opens up about her wedding outfit  Amrita Rao and RJ Anmol kept their wedding quite low-key as compared to grand Bollywood weddings that we have been seeing in the near past. These two tied the knot at Iskcon temple in Katraj, Pune. In the book that the couple released, they mentioned every detail of their wedding. It is mentioned that they spent only Rs 1.50 lakh in total at their wedding including the venue cost, wedding dresses, travel, and other costs. In fact, the most surprising thing was that the actress only spent Rs 3000 on her wedding attire. In the book she mentioned that she was very clear and had also mentioned to her husband before their wedding that she wants to keep it really simple and not opt for any designer wear for her big day. She chose to wear simple traditional attire that cost her only Rs 3000. In fact, the wedding venue also charged them only Rs 11,000.  Amrita Rao was flooded with marriage proposals  In a recent interview with Rajshri Productions, Amrita Rao recalled the time after Vivaah was released.

Speaking to Evoke ahead of their wedding, Tadhg gushed: “Alannah is the opposite to a bridezilla, she’s very easy going and said ‘whatever you like, go for it,’ so I’ve picked the flowers and the band. She went ‘that’s grand’ and there’s been no stress and no panic.”  “It was gas actually, the girl who’s doing the flowers said to me ‘it’s normally the bride and not the groom calling in’ but this has worked perfectly for us.”  “There’s only a couple of weeks to go now but I’d say it’s butterflies more than nerves.”  “It’s exciting but a little stressful at the same time because the list is never ending. But there’s no need to stress, you know who’s coming.”  “The dogs are a massive part of our life – we’ve just got a new puppy two weeks before the wedding,” Tadhg continued.  “And Otis helped me propose, he had on a little tux and the engagement ring was in a box on him, he was my wing man, so they’ll be a big part of the day.”  “The priest told us to make sure the day was about us as well and not all about the dogs but it wouldn’t be our wedding without them.”  Tadhg gushed about his relationship with Alannah in an exclusive interview with Goss.ie last year.  The Kerry native said at the time: “Lockdown definitely made us stronger, we didn’t kill each other! She’s definitely one of my best friends and she’s also my biggest critic. If I have any videos she doesn’t like, she’ll tell me straight, there’s no s**t.”  “She’s brilliant. With anything I do, she pushes me forward.

The fitness bunny documenting her wedding journey on TikTok left us in awe when she revealed her wedding gown. Norton's gown is to die for. It was designed by Oluwagbemisola Okunlola, the CEO and founder of Alonuko Bridal.  The bride’s bespoke gown took almost 2 000 hours to finish because all the embroidery was hand beaded. What we love about the dress is that it sits on her skin like an ornament. The mesh blends well with her skin, and the short veil is a yes because it would’ve been a crime to cover the dress. ♬ original sound - Miles and Toni @newlynorton Weddung dress details @Alonuko dress @Vitalika_nail_stylist nails #newlynorton “So, the vibe is that she’s meant to look like art.

Customer orders have been plunged into chaos since the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.  Despite the firm's initial promise that it would find an 'alternative platform' for registries, families say they are none the wiser about what is happening with their gifts.  It means many can no longer access their wishlist - and some have even lost money due to the glitch.  Mom-to-be Jessica Ferrara is celebrating her baby shower on Saturday and guests are now unable to view her registry data.  Even if they could view it, every item is out of stock or discontinued.  On top of that, Ferrara and her partner lost $1,000 on purchases they made themselves such as a crib that converts into a toddler bed and items needed to turn a dresser into a changing table.  Before the purchases arrived, the site said they were out of stock. Customer service has yet to offer her a refund.  The 36-year-old told the Philadelphia Inquirer: 'Your third trimester you’re supposed to be enjoying it and nesting.  'There certainly hasn’t been any nesting going on.'  Similarly, bride-to-be CC Manstrom said she has watched the majority of the 30 items on her registry become unavailable.  She is now worried that several people will buy her the same limited gifts which are available.  The retailer has also stopped honoring credits - meaning Manstrom lost out on the $60 that had been put into her account for gifts which were purchased but not available.  She hasn't been able to speak to a customer service representative on the phone.  'It is frustrating. It’s a new task you have to deal with on the wedding checklist,' Manstrom told the New York Times.  Meanwhile, Amy Tamayo wrote on TikTok: 'When you find out that none of your wedding registry orders were fulfilled & BBB gave you store credit without telling you.'  After initially announcing the bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would partner with another platform where couples could transfer their existing data.  It said it would share the information 'within days.'  But more than two weeks on, no announcement has been made.  Mom-to-be Jessica Ferrara, pictured, is celebrating her baby shower on Saturday and guests are now unable to view her registry  Customer orders have been plunged into chaos since the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April  A note on the retailer's website still reads: 'Customers’ registry data is important to us.

And Zola, an online registry, told the New York Times it had received 'several hundred emails' from couples asking to transfer their Bed Bath & beyond registries.  The chain is one of several bricks-and-mortar stores to fall victim to the so-called 'retail apocalypse.'  The store's official closing down sales began on April 26.

"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Brits"", ""NorthWest"", ""SouthAfrica""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:07:00","There are lots of different thoughts and opinions on wedding planning etiquette (Picture: Getty)  Weddings are a wonderful celebration of love but they can also cause more than their fair share of drama - especially when there's tricky social dynamics or finances to navigate.  Our advice to brides and grooms-to-be? Offer plus ones if you can.  Almost half (49%) of Brits said they would be bothered if they didn't get a plus one to a wedding, according to a survey of more than 2,000 Brits by wedding supplier Ginger Ray, shared exclusively with Metro.co.uk.  In fact, people feel so passionately about this issue that 10% would go as far as decline an invite altogether if they didn't get a plus one.  High costs of weddings can also divide the crowds. A third of wedding guests (34%) think those tying the knot should pay for guest accommodation. And interestingly, those who earn more expect more.  Nearly half of Brits with a salary of £55,000 per year or more said they would be bothered if their accommodation wasn't paid for, compared to just 31% of those who earn £15,000 or less a year.  You'll also want to keep the purse strings of bridesmaids and groomsmen in mind, as 63% of Brits said it was acceptable to decline an invitation to be in the wedding party because of the costs and responsibilities associated with it.  One in six Brits would skip a wedding altogether to save money (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  But on the plus side, only a third of people believe the couple should cover every cost for the wedding party and over half (54%) said they shouldn’t pay - so if you need to ask your bridesmaid's to pay for their dresses, it won't come as a surprise to most.  Separate research by jeweller F. Hinds backed up that money is a real sticking point for guests.  Around third of the 2,000 surveyed said they would skip part of a wedding to save money. One in five would skip the reception and just attend the ceremony while 16% would skip the nuptials and head for the party.  With Brits spending an average of £604 to attend each wedding, one in six Brits claimed they would decline the invite altogether in a bid to save some cash.  Then you've got the cost of destination weddings which, while they look great on the Instagram, can burn a hole in your pocket.  Top ways guests would choose to save money attending a wedding: Wearing something they already own to save on a new outfit - 42% Not attending the hen or stag do - 25% Spending less on a wedding gift for the couple - 23% Booking cheap accommodation - 22% Driving to the venue to avoid getting a taxi - 20% Only attending the wedding ceremony - 18% Declining the wedding invitation - 17% Only attending the wedding reception - 16% Sharing travel or accommodation with other guests - 15% Not drinking at the reception - 12%  When it comes to children-free weddings, things can sometimes get pretty heated between the future married couple and guests who have young kids.  But interestingly, the Ginger Ray survey found over half of Brits said they wouldn't be bothered if their kids weren't invited to the wedding and only 9% wouldn't attend as a result. Maybe it would be a welcome break to have a little adult time.  About 16% of Brits would skip the wedding ceremony and attend the reception (Picture: Getty Images)  How to avoid these wedding mishaps  Ginger Ray's wedding planning expert Jess Martin shared her advice for navigating some common, tricky situations during wedding season.    Declining an invite due to finances  'The way you go about it is what really matters, and if someone loves you enough to have invited you to be in their wedding, then they will completely understand the reasons why you can’t accept.  Budgeting as a guest/bridesmaid/groomsman  'Questions like: ""I’m trying to budget for your big day, can you let me know what things I will need to pay for myself so I can plan for it?"" or ""So I know how much to budget for, can you let me know what you will be paying for and what I’ll need to pay for myself?""  'This shows the couple you’re aware there will be additional costs, but leaves the onus on them to explain what costs you might incur as part of the wedding party.  Telling guests they DO NOT have a plus one  'The best way to avoid this question is to make it really clear on your wedding invitations who the invite is for, specifically.  'I’d go so far as to write on the invitations something like: ""no additional guest invited"" or ""no +1 allowed"" or ""this invite is for Jane and Jane only"" to just make your point totally clear!  'Whether you don’t want a plus one from a financial perspective, from a capacity point of view, or because you simply do not want people you don’t know at your wedding, it’s your wedding and your rules!'  'If it bothers your guests so much that they cannot bring another person to the wedding of one of their friends, then perhaps they shouldn’t come at all.'  At the end of the day it's your wedding and your rules (within reason) (Picture: Getty Images)  Making sure there's no surprise little guests  'The best way to make the point clear, is again to make sure it’s written in the invitations. Including the message ""this wedding is for adults only"" or ""please note: children are not invited on this occasion"" are simple disclaimers that get the point across in a clear and concise way.  'If after that you still are asked the question, all you need to do is respond with: ""as mentioned in the invitations, we have decided to make our wedding day an adults-only event, and there will not be any facilities or catering options for children. We’re really sorry if this means you can’t make the wedding, but we totally understand!""'  Telling family they'll have to pay for their own accomodation  'Most people won’t expect you to pay for accommodation as just a guest. However, clarity is key when it comes to family members and those in the wedding party.  'Let them know as soon as possible whether they will need to find and book their own place to stay.  'In your wedding invitations or save the dates, it can be nice to include a list of suggested accommodation options. It also serves as a handy hint that people will need to find and book their own.  'If you are lucky enough to have some rooms available for guests to stay in at your venue, make it very clear who is staying where otherwise people may automatically presume they can stay and let people know as soon as possible.'

Upset over the Church’s indifference, the bridegroom is now slated to move a contempt of court petition in the High Court against the Knanaya Church.  The 31-year-old bridegroom, a member of St. Anne’s Church, Kottody, in Kasaragod under the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam, was slated to marry Vijimol, a member of St Xavier’s Church, Kottody, under the Thalassery archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church.  Also Read | A wedding could script history for Knanaya Catholic Church  Although he was entitled to get a consent or Vivaha Kuri from his church as per a High Court order, he was denied the same at the last minute citing the absence of an application. As the marriage sacrament could not be completed, the bridegroom and bride exchanged garlands at a brief function held outside St Xavier’s Church.  “Having completed all the stipulations for marrying a woman such as attending the pre-marriage course and making confession, there is no reason why the Church should deny me the consent,” Mr. John said. The marriage, according to him, was scheduled to be organised at the bride’s parish to avoid a possible law and order situation at his own parish.  Meanwhile, the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samiti, a reformation group that leads legal battle to end the practice of endogamy in the Knanaya Church, will also file a contempt of court case in the High Court against the denial of Vivaha Kuri to Mr. John.  The Knanaya Archeparchy, on its part, clarified that the bridegroom had failed to submit relevant documents and complete procedures for his marriage. “He approached the parish for a consent only on the eve of his wedding. We need to complete the canonical procedure before issuing the consent for the marriage,” said Fr. Michael Vettikkatt, spokesperson of the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam.  As to a query whether the membership of Mr. John with the Knanaya Archeparchy stood cancelled with the wedding, Fr. Vettikkatt replied that the court had prohibited termination of membership of a member for marrying from outside the sect.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9rZXJhbGEvd2VkZGluZy10dXJucy1hLWRhbXAtc3F1aWItYnJpZGVncm9vbS10by1tb3ZlLWNvbnRlbXB0LXBsZWEtYWdhaW5zdC1rbmFuYXlhLWNhdGhvbGljLWNodXJjaC9hcnRpY2xlNjY4NjcwODMuZWNl0gGiAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS93ZWRkaW5nLXR1cm5zLWEtZGFtcC1zcXVpYi1icmlkZWdyb29tLXRvLW1vdmUtY29udGVtcHQtcGxlYS1hZ2FpbnN0LWtuYW5heWEtY2F0aG9saWMtY2h1cmNoL2FydGljbGU2Njg2NzA4My5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The predicament was explained in a post originally shared on Facebook, which later sparked discussion on the social media site Reddit.  ""Looking for advice here. I have my half sister's wedding in September this year. My whole family are hearing, I'm the only one Deaf and use Auslan,"" the original post explained.  A bride's refusal to cover the cost of her Deaf sister's interpreter's meals at the wedding reception has ignited a debate. Image: Getty Creative  ""My sister is refusing to pay and accomodate for 2 Auslan interpreters to be at the wedding reception. I will be paying the Auslan interpreters with my NDIS funding of course but should I be out of pocket for their meals?""  'Feeding them is the least she could do'  Members of a popular Reddit community dedicated to exposing shameful wedding planning practices wasted no time in weighing in on the subject.  ""I would skip the wedding if they are not willing to provide meals to the interpreters,"" voiced one individual, while another emphasised the importance of considering the deaf sister's needs. ""This person invited someone who is Deaf. It's not like the sister doesn't know she needs an interpreter to be comfortable at the wedding. Feeding them is the least she could do. She should have planned her wedding knowing this was going to be a cost.""  RELATED:  Echoing these sentiments, another member, who said they had Deaf family members, affirmed the importance of accommodating interpreters. ""My parents are Deaf and every wedding/funeral/formal event has had interpreting accomodations made by whoever planned the event, my parents don't even ask because it's a known need within my family.""  Story continues  Other group members concurred, with one describing the cost of two extra meals as a ""nominal cost"" and negligible in the overall context of a wedding, especially considering the financial burden the Deaf person already faces in hiring interpreters for the event.  Redditors were divided on the topic. Photo: Facebook  ""The bride should 100% be paying for their meals for them. I can't believe that is even a suggestion that she wouldn't.""  Adding to the discussion, a wedding photographer chuckled, ""you’d be amazed the lengths some couples go to in order to save $45 on their $17K wedding. It’s insane.""  On the other hand  However, not everyone thought the bride should shoulder the cost of the interpreters' meals at the wedding reception.  ""I would offer to pay for the meals of my own interpreters,"" one person told the group, ""I would expect my half-sister to accommodate my interpreters at my table, but I would gladly offer to pay for their meals.""  ""I’m actually really torn,"" said another ""I kind of side with the bride, here. She should absolutely accommodate them by welcoming them, making space for them at the table, seating chart, etc. but I definitely don’t think the bride needs to pay them for their services.""  The discussion surrounding the issue went on to raise broader questions regarding the lack of sign language knowledge within families and significant issues faced by the Deaf community.  ""I'm confused as to why she needs an interpreter,"" someone stated. ""Why hasn't her family learned sign language? Do they really expect her to go to Christmas dinner and barbecues and hanging out with aunts and uncles without being able to communicate with them?""  A group member identifying as Deaf highlighted the common occurrence of hearing families neglecting to learn sign language. ""Actually, Deaf here,"" they wrote, ""the majority of hearing families never learn sign for their deaf family member.""  Another person further explained that it is indeed quite common for parents of Deaf children to forgo learning sign language, hoping that their children will rely on lip-reading. ""If many parents won’t even bother to learn it, then it’s very possible her extended family hasn’t either.""  ""Even if her family had learned (which it sounds like they haven't),"" another person said ""will the maid of honour have learned just to accomodate her? The best man? Staff at the venue? Anyone else who might speak at the event? Probably not.""  ""To be left out of every single joke. It would be beyond isolating!""  Never miss a thing. Sign up to Yahoo Lifestyle’s daily newsletter.

The bride is the daughter of Yashpal Benam from the Pauri region in Uttarakhand. The leader is drawing criticism from the masses as his daughter is marrying a Muslim man.  The photo of the card has gained traction on social media, with both supporters and opponents of the BJP criticising Benam.  advertisement  While Hindutva hardliners are trolling the former MLA and the saffron party alleging “double standards"", others are calling the marriage an attempt of ""Love Jihad"", comparing it with the recently released controversial movie The Kerala Stories.  “The BJP-ruled states are making films like ‘The Kerala Story’ tax-free while here a BJP leader’s daughter is marrying a Muslim man. These are double standards of the BJP and party workers will get demoralised,” said a Facebook user.  “Love jihad” is a term often used by BJP leaders as well as right-wing activists to allege a ploy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into religious conversion through marriage.  ALSO READ |'The Kerala Story' contains hate speech, based on manipulated facts: Bengal defends ban in SC  Speaking to India Today, officials from the Pauri Temple Committee said, ""It is a matter of concern. Getting daughters of Hindu families married to men from other religions is a part of propaganda. In India, the laws on conversion are being altered, the tombs built for and by people of other communities on government properties are being demolished by the Centre. Still, BJP's own leaders are getting their daughters married to a Muslim man,"" one of the committee members said.  He further said that people from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal should oppose this.  ""BJP is a party for the protection of Hindus. It should immediately expel such people from the party,"" the man added.  People close to Yashpal Benam, on condition of anonymity, said that his daughter studied at Lucknow University and was in a relationship with the man whom she is going to marry.  The wedding is slated to take place at a resort in Pauri on May 28. Benam is the chairman of the Pauri Municipal Corporation. He was earlier with the Congress and won as an independent from the Pauri Assembly constituency in 2007.  Political leaders from both the BJP and the Congress have been invited to the wedding.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Jaipur"", ""Rajasthan"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:34:01","It is understandable why destination weddings have grown in popularity in India in recent years. They not only give the couple and their guests a special experience, but they also give people a chance to travel to new and intriguing places in the nation. But as times have changed, more and more couples are choosing destination weddings, where they can say their vows in front of beautiful settings while being joined by family and friends.  However, it’s not just about ‘destination weddings’ anymore. The latest trend to hit the marriage market is ‘Vicination Weddings’ - destination weddings held near to or in the same area as the couple’s or their families’ primary residence.  Couples are opting to say their vows at close locations instead of travelling to a distant location because they provide a special and intimate experience for everyone involved. Tourist destinations close to Tier-1 and Metro cities are becoming more popular as a result of this trend. In the north are Jaipur, Udaipur, Mussoorie, Agra, and Lonavala, while in the south are Coorg, Ooty, Mahabalipuram, and Puducherry.  Vicination weddings are gaining popularity for multiple reasons, including the ease of travel, familiarity of the place as they enjoyed a change of scene from a typical wedding. The couples and the family also get to imbibe some local feel to the D-Day.    ​​​​​​​Convenience  Vicination weddings are becoming increasingly popular in India due to the convenience factor they offer. By having the wedding in a nearby location, the couple can save on travel costs and minimise the amount of planning and coordination required. Moreover, guests who may have busy schedules or other commitments can attend the wedding without having to take too much time off work or away from their families.    Promote culture & tradition  Weddings in the vicinity offer the chance to showcase the local culture and traditions. The wedding venue and decor can incorporate local elements and traditions, giving the wedding a unique and authentic feel. Moreover, by supporting local vendors and businesses, the wedding can contribute to the local economy and community.    The difference  While vicination weddings can be a sought-after option for people not willing to go far for a wedding, there is a fair chance of missing out on some fun of a destination wedding. If the location is familiar to the guests and the couple, it may not offer the same level of novelty or adventure as a destination wedding.  For couples who wish to commemorate their special day without the added hassle and expense of travelling far away, vicination weddings are a sensible and handy choice.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Goshen"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:29:43","A 77-year-old woman from Ohio has fulfilled her lifelong dream – to marry herself.  Dorothy “Dottie” Fideli celebrated her love for herself during a wedding ceremony at her retirement home on Saturday 13 May. The mother of three and grandmother was married once in 1965, but the marriage ended after nine years. Now, after 40 years of being single, she’s finally performed the ultimate act of self love.  “This is something I’ve always wanted,” Fideli told NBC affiliate WLWT5. “I wanted to get married and have a happy life but things didn’t work out that way and now I have a second chance in doing something that’ll make me happy.”  The wedding, which took place at O’Bannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, was an emotional and symbolic ceremony surrounded by family and friends. Fideli initially got the idea to marry herself from her neighbours, who had heard about a woman doing something similar on a talk show, WLWT5 reported.  “I do some crazy things around here just to make people laugh,” she said in an interview with Today. “When I see them all down in the dumps, I go get one of my outfits on and dress up and come down, and they smile.”  But on Saturday, Fideli’s plan to uplift the residents of the retirement home turned out to be an emotional and symbolic ceremony.  For her first wedding in 1965, Fideli and her ex-husband quickly exchanged vows at a courthouse, but “he went to work and I went home” right after the ceremony. “I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,” she jokingly told Today. Fideli added that she always wished she could have had a “big wedding”, but had thought it was “too late” for her.  It’s because of her daughter, Donna Pennington, that Fideli’s dreams came true. Her daughter did all the cooking for the big day, and decorated the retirement home’s community room with balloons. Fideli wore a white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt, as well as a white veil with an embellished headband.  Story continues  “I told my daughter, I said, ‘This is the best thing that I’ve ever had, outside of having you kids,’” Fideli told Today. “‘This is what I’ve always wanted and I’m so happy that you [gave] it to me.’”  Like any bride, the 77-year-old was “nervous” leading up to the wedding but was ultimately “really happy” when she married herself. During the ceremony, which was officiated by the retirement home’s property manager, Fideli held a white lily in her hand as a symbol for self-love, according to Today.  “I said, ‘Everybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they’re happy and everything’s going to be hunky-dory, but they don’t consider the inside, the little petals inside,’” she recalled.  “‘The inside is what’s important. That’s where God’s love flows,’” Fideli continued. “‘That’s where he gives you wisdom and he gives you hope. And nobody ever takes time to think about that. So that’s what I’ve done, and I’d appreciate it if all of you people would do it and think of it that way.’”  After dedicating much of her time towards raising her family, Fideli said she’s “at the point” in my life” where it’s “my turn to do what I want to do”.  “Love, love is the most important thing in this world, and if you love God and love yourself, this world will be a field of roses,” Fideli told WLWT5, adding that she hopes her story inspires others to find their own self-love.  “If it’s not in the cards for them, then there’s something out there that will make them happy and find themselves in life and fulfil their soul.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZWxkZXJseS13b21hbi1tYXJyaWVzLWhlcnNlbGYtYWdlLTA5Mjk0MzA1NC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2VsZGVybHktd29tYW4tbWFycmllcy1oZXJzZWxmLWFnZS0wOTI5NDMwNTQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:56:23","A woman looking for advice on what to wear to a friend’s wedding sparked a spirited debate about what makes a dress too similar to a wedding gown.  The woman, who goes by the Reddit user name u/phonate, shared a picture of her initial look in the popular forum r/Weddingattireapproval, asking: “Floral formal for late summer/early fall wedding by the sea Suggestions welcomed??”  The picture in the post showcased a tan lace dress with a deep V neckline and ruffled skirt, its entirety adorned with multi-coloured flowers. The outfit is currently being sold by designer fashion brand Teuta Matoshi for $749.  In the caption, the Reddit user described the dress code of the wedding and the itinerary for the event.  “Colourful formal with a floral twist…interesting patterns and prints, high-hats, scarves, oversized jackets, favourite dress,” she wrote. “Wedding ceremony by the ocean, followed by dinner reception and party. The setting of the party is a micro-village with festivities shifting between our garden, adjacent the ocean and at our house.”  She noted that while she thought the lace midi-dress would be a good fit, she thought that other people in the Reddit forum may have “better ideas” for her.  As of 18 May, the post has more than 2,200 upvotes, with fellow Reddit users expressing that the outfit looks too similar to the style of a wedding gown and encouraging her to find a new one.  “It’s pretty but find it in a different colour, I’ve seen bridal gowns that look just like this,” one wrote.  “I had to check and make sure this wasn’t a bride asking for opinions on her wedding gown. Sooo, probably not a good choice,”  A third shared: “I think it’s too light. I just saw a wedding dress that looked almost identical, Teuta Matoshi has a million different colours. I think green would be nice.”  However, other people felt like it was a good fit for the occasion given its dress code.  “I love this super specific theme tbh,” one wrote. “Love this dress + matches the theme perfectly!”  Story continues  “I say WEAR IT!!! ITS FREAKING GORGEOUS,” another wrote, while a third added: “I think it works, especially because it’s tea-length and not white.”  The wedding guest later gave an update on the situation and revealed that the bride told her not to wear this gown, writing: “Checked with the bride and this dress is cancelled. Seeking recommendations for alternatives!”  It’s a general rule of thumb that guests should not wear white to someone’s wedding. With that in mind, wedding dress designer Madeline Gardner also told The Knot that there are some dress colours that guests should avoid.  “When you’re a guest at a wedding, the most important thing to keep in mind is not to upstage or upset the bride,” Gardner said. “It’s safe to stay away from any outfits that are predominantly white, cream or ivory.”  This is far from the first time a wedding guest’s outfit has sparked an etiquette debate. Earlier this week, Olivia Wilde was met with mixed reactions when she wore a backless white gown to Colton Underwood’s wedding to Jordan C Brown.  “Wore a wedding dress to a wedding just so I could make a joke about it in my toast,” Wilde captioned a since-expired photo of herself wearing the dress and holding a white parasol at the ceremony on her Instagram Stories.  Despite the criticism she faced for her look, the Don’t Worry Darling star revealed that the grooms “approved” her dress selection in a follow-up post.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vd29tYW4tc3BhcmtzLWRlYmF0ZS1tYWtlcy1kcmVzcy0xNzU2MjM4MjMuaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC93b21hbi1zcGFya3MtZGViYXRlLW1ha2VzLWRyZXNzLTE3NTYyMzgyMy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-01","19:00:00","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:07:30","[This story contains spoilers to the season 19 two-episode finale of Grey’s Anatomy, “Wedding Bell Blues/Happily Ever After.”]  The two-hour conclusion to Grey’s Anatomy’s 19th season welcomed back two of its recently departed doctors, and left another character’s fate up in the air.  After exiting the hit ABC medical drama as a series regular earlier in the season, Ellen Pompeo made her anticipated return during the May 18 two-part finale, “Wedding Bell Blues/Happily Ever After.” The episode split its time between the veteran cast and the younger batch of interns, with the main storyline centering around Simone’s (Alexis Floy) wedding day and the young doctor ultimately calling off her nuptials and choosing Lucas (Niko Terho). With the wedding as the backdrop, love was in the air for many of the characters — including Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Link (Chris Carmack), who finally vocalized their love for one another.  And both Meredith (Pompeo) and Maggie (Kelly McCreary) — after wrapping each of their stories by choosing their own passions over love — rekindled their relationships on their own terms in their returns. When a group of the Grey Sloan Memorial doctors fly out to Boston to attend the ceremony for the coveted Catherine Fox Award (where Chandra Wilson’s Bailey, in a heartfelt moment, received a surprise award for her devotion to reproductive health care after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision), both Nick (Scott Speedman) and Winston (Anthony Hill) got the chance to reunite with their estranged partners. Meredith and Nick last spoke when she pretended to not hear his “I love you” while she boarded her plane to Boston with her children; and Maggie and husband Winston left their marriage up in the air when she moved to Chicago to pursue her medical ambitions.  Meredith and Nick cleared up a few misunderstandings, mainly that Nick should have never let Meredith walk away. “I want to live a whole life with love, and mess and pain… and you,” he told her, to which she replied, “Well, OK, then,” and they shared a kiss. Meanwhile, Winston finally matched Maggie’s ambitions and when he did, they agreed to start here and figure out the rest as they embark on a long-distance relationship.  But the episode wasn’t all about tying things up in neat bows. Meredith, who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer’s, potentially put her career in jeopardy by making public her new findings, which contradict decades of studies. Webber (James Pickens Jr.) potentially put his sobriety in jeopardy after being rocked by a near-death experience on the flight to Boston. And Teddy (Kim Raver) ends the episode unconscious and on the floor of a surgery room, her fate unclear by the episode’s end. Teddy, who was recently named Chief, spent the episode complaining of a toothache before falling to the ground in the final moment. (Spoiler alert: Raver has closed her deal to return next season, THR has learned.)  On McCreary’s part, in a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter about her exit, the actress left the door open to cycle back into the show in the future, similar to exiting stars before her (Kate Walsh appeared in three episodes this season, reprising her Dr. Addison Montgomery). “I love that about the show, that people come back. I think it’s open. I think that’s a question for Meg Marinis, who is the new showrunner. But I am open to it and I think the storyline leaves it pretty open,” she said. Speaking to the finale, she later added to THR, “It seems like even though she’s gone to Chicago, Maggie and Winston’s story isn’t over. I’m happy to see there’s still love, respect — and of course a lot of heat between them.”  The finale also brings an end to Krista Vernoff’s run as showrunner, as she passes over the reins to Marinis for the 20th season of ABC’s longest-running primetime scripted series, created by Shonda Rhimes. Vernoff and Marinis co-wrote “Wedding Bell Blues,” while Marinis wrote “Happily Ever After?” The episodes were directed by Kevin McKidd and Debbie Allen, respectively.  Since her high-profile exit, Pompeo has remained an executive producer and the show’s narrator. She remains in the ABC family with her next show under her Disney deal being a Hulu limited series. The door remains open for her Grey’s return, per sources, and while her involvement in season 20 has yet to be made official, the finale certainly set up more to explore with Meredith Grey.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS90di90di1uZXdzL2dyZXlzLWFuYXRvbXktZmluYWxlLWNsaWZmaGFuZ2VyLW1lcmVkaXRoLWdyZXktZWxsZW4tcG9tcGVvLXJldHVybnMtMTIzNTQ5NTczMy_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL3R2L3R2LW5ld3MvZ3JleXMtYW5hdG9teS1maW5hbGUtY2xpZmZoYW5nZXItbWVyZWRpdGgtZ3JleS1lbGxlbi1wb21wZW8tcmV0dXJucy0xMjM1NDk1NzMzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Duchess of Sussex moved her groom to tears in the classic silk gown in pure white, with a 15ft veil embroidered with flowers of the Commonwealth.  The dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, was minimal yet classic, the main focus being the open bateau neckline that gracefully framed the shoulders and sculpted Meghan's waist.  However, another wedding dress would soon be on view that day - five years ago today. And this one wowed the crowds in quite a different way.  For the wedding ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on May 19, 2018, Meghan wore a pure white silk Givenchy dress  The elegant dress by designer Clare Waight Keller had a simple bateau neckline and a long train  As with other royal brides, Meghan changed into a second dress for the evening, this time opting for a bespoke Stella McCartney design  The ceremony had taken place St George's, Windsor, on May 19 2018 in front of 600 guests.  Afterwards, however, 200 of the bride and groom's closest friends and family went on to Frogmore House on the Windsor estate for an evening reception hosted by Prince Charles .  As with other royal brides, Meghan changed into a second dress for the intimate gathering, this time opting for a bespoke Stella McCartney design.  While the first dress was expected to be a 'traditional and elegant' wedding gown, the second was a modest yet more glamorous number.  The slinky evening dress was made from silk crepe and the halter neck gown was pure white just like Meghan's £200,000 Givenchy number for the ceremony.  The backless number allowed the Duchess of Sussex to show off her toned shoulders and back and the figure-hugging gown featured a dramatic fluted skirt.  Meghan paired the evening gown with heels by Aquazurra made in silky satin with nude mesh and soles painted in baby blue.  Meghan wore an aquamarine ring belonging to the late Lady Diana Spencer, thought to have been a sentimental gift from Prince Harry so as to include his mother on the big day.  The evening halter-neck dress was made from silk crepe and the halter neck gown was pure white. Here Meghan and Harry are pictured leaving Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House  The happy newlyweds danced the night away following an outfit change  The low-cut design of the evening gown showed off Meghan's back and shoulders  Meghan shows of an acquamarine ring that had once belonged to her mother-in-law, Diana  Prince Harry also had an outfit change into a sleek dinner suit with black tie as he and Meghan headed to the reception in an ice-blue vintage Jaguar.  Sharing a sketch of the design Meghan wore to the evening reception in 2018, British designer, Stella McCartney said:  'I am so proud and honoured to have been chosen by the Duchess of Sussex to make her evening gown and represent British design.  'It has truly been one of the most humbling moments of my career and I am so proud of all the team on this stunning sunny royal day,' she told fashion magazine Women's Wear Daily.  Many had suspected that Meghan would choose McCartney, given the designer's stance against using fur and leather, as well as her use of organic fabrics - an outlook which fits with Meghan and Harry's eco-friendly principles  Stella McCartney spoke of her pride as she shared a sketch of the evening halter neck gown  Unlike the dress worn during the ceremony, the evening gown had a smaller train and the slinky material meant Meghan and Harry could dance the night away.  Her hair - styled by George Northwood - was up in a tight bun with face-framing layers, which perfectly suited the dress and the less-formal evening occasion.  Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage revealed to Femail that the gown would probably have cost around £80,000 for fabric, design and fittings.  Kate, the Princess of Wales, also wore two wedding dresses on her big day in 2011, which were both designed by Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA1MDI1Ny9NZWdoYW5zLVNFQ09ORC13ZWRkaW5nLWdvd24tZ2xhbW9yb3VzLW51bWJlci1kYW5jZWQtbmlnaHQtYXdheS1IYXJyeS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA1MDI1Ny9hbXAvTWVnaGFucy1TRUNPTkQtd2VkZGluZy1nb3duLWdsYW1vcm91cy1udW1iZXItZGFuY2VkLW5pZ2h0LWF3YXktSGFycnkuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Is there a proper way to notify them of the wedding without inviting them? My brother’s family and my aunt and uncle all have clear qualms about queer relationships. I think they’d also be offended not to be invited. I would like to find the most gracious means to handle this.  GENTLE READER: The most gracious thing would be to invite them, as this demonstrates trust that they are fundamentally decent and care about you as a member of their family first, putting any other opinions they may hold second.  But Miss Manners infers that past behaviors have convinced you that such trust would be misplaced, and that they will be unpleasant no matter what you do. Better, then, to omit them from the guest list and leave it at that. They will learn about the nuptials and can gnash their teeth without any action on your part.  DEAR MISS MANNERS: I invited a group to dinner at my home to celebrate the expected return of another friend from a long residence overseas. The guest of honor immediately suggested I change the date to better match the schedule of another guest; I did so.  Then I learned that several of the guests had a private conversation to set up an even better date for all of them as an alternative. I was not privy to this conversation until after they had decided on a new date -- one on which I was not available to attend, much less host. In the meantime, the original invitation was still out there, though I now knew that most of the guests had planned another event. How should I have treated the original invitation?  GENTLE READER: As your guests are likely as confused about the original invitation as Miss Manners, she suggests you call everyone to review the bidding. This will involve another round of calls, but will also give you the opportunity to appear gracious while making it clear that you have been cheated out of your plan.

I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful.

The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 miles per hour in a 25 miles per hour zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety.  Hutchinson said he’s not ready to address the driver at this time.  “I can’t right now,” he said. “I’d like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.”  ABC News’ Will McDuffie contributed to this report.  Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio.

Timing is everything.”  “Her zest for life inspires me and definitely keeps me on my toes,” says Julie, who proposed to Angela at home in Phoenix, Arizona, the day before the couple left for a getaway to Spain. She handmade a book documenting their love story in which the final page popped the question. “Compared to our wedding festivities,” Julie says, “it was perfectly simple, private, and romantic.”  Working with the Parker’s catering/sales manager — and “planner extraordinaire” — Randy Araiza, the pair went all out to make the long weekend super personal and packed with activity for the whole family. “The first time we walked into the Parker, we felt it captured us,” Julie says, “the desert feel of Arizona; the midcentury, funky feel of Palm Springs; and the easy-going yet top-scale vibe.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhbG1zcHJpbmdzbGlmZS5jb20vcGFya2VyLXBhbG0tc3ByaW5ncy1ob3N0cy13ZWRkaW5nLXdpdGgtYS10b3VjaC1vZi13aGltc3kv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Almost exactly four years later, they took the next big step when Brad got down on one knee in Santorini, Greece.  The duo got right to wedding planning. “We chose our venue and most vendors in 2018, and it was smooth sailing—until we called it off in April 2020,” Elizabeth remembers. “The hardest part of the planning process was postponing our wedding and trusting that things would come together the following year. It turned out to be such a blessing in disguise and I’m grateful we had the extra time to make our wedding weekend outstanding. In the end, we were engaged for 1,117 days—which became a bit of a joke among our friends and family, but it worked for us! When you’re vowing to be together forever, what’s another year or three?”  Timing aside, it was the vision that mattered, and it came together flawlessly. For Elizabeth and Brad, the wedding was more than one day. It actually turned into a whole weekend affair. “I think I decided I’d get married at Roche Harbor when I was about 13,” the bride laughs. ""So, I was quite relieved when Brad enthusiastically agreed. San Juan Island is one of my favorite places on earth, and Roche Harbor Resort in particular holds special significance for my family.” Her family has been visiting there since the 1960s. Now, there was a chance to show off this sliver of the Pacific Northwest to all of their family and friends joining from out of state.  “We wanted the weekend to feel like an all-inclusive, elevated summer camp experience,” Elizabeth says. “Many of our guests arrived by seaplane, which set the tone for a unique adventure. We created a calendar of events and wanted each night to feel distinct and slightly more formal than the previous, and provide ample quality time to mix our friend groups.” Festivities began on Thursday, when the bridal party kicked off the weekend with a luau dinner at Westcott Bay Shellfish Co., complete with lawn games and root beer floats. There was a whale-watching excursion for guests arriving Friday, a welcome dinner, and a send-off brunch on Sunday.  Of course, there was also the main event. “Our Saturday wedding day was a marathon,” Elizabeth adds. Read on to see all the incredible details, planned by Kaleb Norman James and photographed by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography.  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  “We began our wedding day with a 7 a.m. ‘polar plunge’ into the 55-degree water of Puget Sound,” Elizabeth recounts. “It was such a fun and memorable way to kick off the big day. My mom brought everyone doughnuts, and then my bridesmaids and I dashed back to our room for hair and makeup.” Her beauty vision was natural and understated, with eyelash extensions for a little extra oomph. “My updo matched the simplicity of my dress; it felt very bridal.""  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Wedding dress shopping was a family affair. She found her off-the-shoulder Carolina Herrera gown at the since-shuttered Nordstrom Wedding Suite in Seattle. “My mom and I found not only my dress, but also hers and a new suit for my dad!” Elizabeth says. “I knew this dress was the one as soon as I put it on: It was an elegant yet simple design that let me shine through.”  She went all in on the something old, new, borrowed, and blue tradition, with her most meaningful accessory being a veil. “My mom handmade it from the lace and layers of her own wedding dress, which she cut up to create my veil,” Elizabeth says. “It was gorgeous and such a meaningful addition to my look.”  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  “Brad wore a blue suit with a subtle windowpane pattern,” Elizabeth describes. “He stood out from the groomsmen who wore navy, but they all had matching ties, white shirts, and chestnut-brown shoes.”  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  The couple was playful with their first look—Elizabeth tried tricking Brad by tapping the wrong shoulder, but he couldn’t be fooled. They share, “As we finished our photos, we looked up and realized my dad was standing on the balcony above us, so he was able to witness the moment as well!”  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  “My bridesmaids represented women from different stages in my life. It was so inspiring to see new friendships blossoming between girls I’d known separately for a long time, but had yet to meet each other.” She gave the girls autonomy in selecting their dress, as long as it was full-length in a blue-green color palette.

A friend officiated the ceremony, and the couple exchanged personalized vows. “As the world’s biggest Michigan football fan, Brad was impressed that I ended my vows with a quote from Coach Bo Schembechler. His were very sweet as well,” Elizabeth says. Readings at the ceremony excerpted from James Kavanaugh, Bell Hooks, and Jeanette Winterson.

Custom embroidered napkins and runners featured the couple’s monogram, which they also had emblazoned on corn hole boards on the lawn, and slippers for guests.

The next day, an onlooker from the yacht dock nearby told the couple, “‘I was loving the free concert, but was confused when the music suddenly stopped and the singing continued. What happened?’ Well, we were all scream-singing to Backstreet Boys while wearing silent disco headphones!” Guests could set their headphones to a pop channel curated by the bride or a classic rock channel created by the groom. Late-night pizza arrived and guests posted up at the outdoor bar for cigars and a nightcap to end the incredible evening.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vc29waGlzdGljYXRlZC13ZWRkaW5nLXdlZWtlbmQtc2FuLWp1YW4taXNsYW5kLTc0OTg3NjjSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

What starts out as a frivolous romcom about a jealous sibling trying to sabotage her big sister’s wedding, evolves into light-hearted thriller with ninja ladies flying through the air with Pakistani panache.  “Polite Society” blends Jane Austen with “House of the Flying Daggers.”  Two sisters pledge to defy arranged marriage and arrange their own lives instead. Young Ria longs to be a stunt woman. Elder sis Lena attends art school.  But when her parents invite a handsome young doctor for dinner, Lena’s resolve melts.  To Ria’s disgust, Lena says yes to Salim’s proposal.  Ninja wannabe Ria gathers her BFFs, Clara and Alba, to concoct a multi-phase scheme to disrupt the marriage by any means necessary – up to and including spin kicks in wedding dresses.  Ria’s inept kung fu moves just add to the fun.  The amusing marital mash up ends in preposterous fashion with a sci-fi twist.  Usually such silliness annoys me, but two qualities saved “Polite Society.”  First, Nida Manzoor’s British film about a traditional Pakistani family takes pointed, but loving shots, at the submissive role of women in their culture. Ria and Lena both intend to forge their own path.  All goes well until Lena opts to trade her feminist sensibility for the accoutrements of gold digging.  Outraged, Ria, the kick-ass-sister, pledges to fight the good feminist fight, with BFFs Alba and Clara at her side.  But it’s the love between sisters that holds “Polite Society” together.  Ria’s war against her sister’s marriage is partly adolescent jealousy (“I’m prettier!”), but partly separation grief. Ria senses their deep friendship will likely end as sis sells out and moves away.  Ria’s clumsy kicks hide a broken heart.  The ninja shenanigans that cover up tears are actually quite sweet.  In the end, Ria establishes her own YouTube brand: “I am the fury!” Bruce Lee beware.  My runner-up in the “one liner” raffle was “give me that womb!”  That demand refers to Salim’s secret pursuit of the perfect repository for his perfect sperms.  The title “Polite Society” is a subversive stab at rules that try to keep young ladies from breaking the glass ceiling. Manzoor’s script is incisive, clever and outrageous in equal portions.  She’s blowing up movie norms at the same time she revolts against patriarchal Pakistani values.  So what have we here, anyway?  “Polite Society” is an irreverent attack on Pakistani patriarchy crafted with love and affection for all – and including lots of kung fu action.  “Bend it Like Beckham” has a sequel: Bend it like Ria!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaGVsZW5haXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmx5aW5nLXNpc3RlcnMtc3Bpbi1raWNrcy1pbi13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wODEzNjM1Mi1mNDI4LTExZWQtYWJhMi1lZmE5M2IyNjVjMWMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WAVY) – The search is on for the owner of a wedding ring lost at the Virginia Beach Oceanfront.  It started with a normal day at the beach for Michelle Salisbury. Her family was visiting from Bedford, Va.  “We were out playing with the kids, hanging out. We noticed they were looking all over the place like panicked, looking for something,” she said.  They were told a woman lost her ring in the sand.  “This woman was just brushing sand off her hands and her wedding ring flew off,” Salisbury said.  She lent the group some sand tools for the search, but nothing helped.  The group canceled the search and left the area.  Once Salisbury’s husband came back from the bathroom, she relayed the unfortunate news to him.  That’s when he noticed something sparkly in the sand.  “He looked down and the ring was right there. We took off to the boardwalk trying to see if they were still up there,” Salisbury said.  The people searching for the ring were nowhere to be found.  Salisbury turned to the internet for help.  “You know what it’s a shot in the dark, but crazy things have happened. Maybe they’ll see it,” she said.  More than 400,000 people have viewed the Tik Tok, but it hasn’t led to a perfect ring match yet.  “If it was me, I would want someone to help. It’s important. It’s your wedding ring. That’s deep. That’s in your heart,” Salisbury said.  She’s hoping to return the ring as soon as possible.  Salisbury said if someone recognizes the ring to contact her on social media.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdnkuY29tL25ld3MvYmVkZm9yZC13b21hbi11c2VzLXRpay10b2stdG8tZmluZC10aGUtb3duZXItb2Ytd2VkZGluZy1yaW5nLWZvdW5kLWluLXZhLWJlYWNoLW9jZWFuZnJvbnQv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F2eS5jb20vbmV3cy9iZWRmb3JkLXdvbWFuLXVzZXMtdGlrLXRvay10by1maW5kLXRoZS1vd25lci1vZi13ZWRkaW5nLXJpbmctZm91bmQtaW4tdmEtYmVhY2gtb2NlYW5mcm9udC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-07-01","16:00:00","{""Galway"", ""Galway"", ""Ireland""}","Thu 18 May 2023 11:04:26","GALWAY — The town’s code enforcement officer has issued a stop work order on a 5,222-square-foot wedding barn because the owners built it without Planning Board oversight, permits and environmental or traffic studies.  “It’s not a legal building,” said town code officer Treavor Gilday concerning Star Farm Blueberries’s barn, owned and built by Chuck and JoAnn Fetter. “They built it without a permit. They are operating without a CO (certificate of occupancy). We summonsed them to court. The court will decide if there are fines. There are a lot of issues.”  Those issues also include disregarding fire code regulations, which landed Chuck Fetter on Wednesday in front of the Albany Regional Board of Review, a committee of the Department of State, where he was questioned about bypassing the installation of sprinklers and other fire suppression items like lit exits and silent alarms in the bathroom.  Chuck Fetter argued that he shouldn’t need all the fire safety measures as the food is brought in, not cooked on site. Besides, he argued, wedding guests come for the ceremony, not the food.  “They don’t primarily come to eat,” Fetter argued to the board. The meeting was held in Albany, but could also be viewed online. “It’s not the main focus. They go primarily for a wedding.”  Sign up for the Saratoga Now newsletter Keep up with the latest happening in Saratoga Springs, Clifton Park, Ballston Spa and other communities in Saratoga County. Sign up here.  However, the board dismissed his appeal to keep the wooden pole barn fire-suppression free. They adjourned to discuss the case at a future meeting.  While Chuck Fetter did not immediately return a Times Union phone call on Wednesday, he admitted to the board that his approach to building the venue “was a mistake,” but “I didn’t think it was catastrophic.”  “It’s a good spot for weddings,” Chuck Fetter told the board.  There are other problems, too — mainly noise emanating from Fetters’ Galway Road farm that is upsetting neighbors. Donna Miller said music plays loudly throughout receptions, and many of the events include fireworks.  “I hope they will be conscientious and recognize their neighbors,” Miller said. “It’s assumed that they would take into consideration what their wedding venue clients are requesting in regards to noise, particularly to take notice if fireworks are to be used.”  Fireworks require permits, said town Clerk Margaret DeFoe, and she said the couple has never sought a permit for their firework displays.  Noise is the same issue that plagued the neighbors of S&S Saratoga Farm in Saratoga. After a long court battle, the town, which was considering changing the zoning to allow weddings there, finally dropped the idea. Weddings, the town said, were not a permitted use in that area.  Galway resident Tom O’Brien said he’s not happy the Fetters never notified neighbors of their plans. While not completely against a wedding venue there, he has said he is concerned about what could happen next if the town allows Star Farm to build what it wants without oversight.  “Who’s to say that doesn’t change to be a brewery or a bar with (Fetter’s) lack of respect for the town and its regulations,” O’Brien said at a February Town Board meeting. “How does the town keep people from building anything they want?”  Some Town Board members also appear concerned. Councilman Fred Arnold said in an April Town Board meeting, minutes show, that Fetter continues “to do what he wants” even with a cease-and-desist order.  Meanwhile, Star Farm Blueberries continues to advertise as a wedding venue, giving its wedding packages as much play as its blueberries on its website.  “The residents of Galway need to know that there are local laws about construction that are to be adhered to,” Miller said. “If not, it will otherwise open the flood gate and people will get away with just constructing anything without permits.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9nYWx3YXktYmx1ZWJlcnJ5LWZhcm0tYnVpbGRzLXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWUtcGVybWl0cy0xODEwMzA1NS5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2022-09-01","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:32:22","Why Philly Bridal Designer Jovan O’Connor Wore Three Different Gowns for Her Wedding  Her couture ceremony dress was inspired by Sex and the City.  Delivering the latest in style, inspiration, helpful tips and tricks, and everything else you need to know to plan the perfect Philly wedding.  Remember when we told you bridal designer Jovan O’Connor would don two wedding gowns for her Big Day? Well, she ended up sporting three. It’s not too, too much of a surprise, though. She hinted at a bonus look when we chatted with her shortly before her September 2022 wedding. All of them were fabulous — much like Jovan and her groom, whose Morris Arboretum & Gardens wedding was sweet but stylish. Petronella Photography snapped the fashionable festivities below.  It pays to strike up a conversation with a stranger every now and again — at least for Philly-born designer Jovan O’Connor and Kevin Keller, a contractor who hails from Wisconsin. The two met on a sweltering day in August 2010 at Starbucks. He joked that her Frappuccino was not real coffee. She mentioned the heat wave. And that broke the ice. A decade after that, in July 2020, Kevin proposed.  They were engaged for two years before saying “I do” at Morris Arboretum & Gardens in Chestnut Hill. They chose the picturesque spot for its beautiful landscape and history. Their theme was garden chic, and they worked with women-owned businesses and creatives to pull off their dream day.  “As a business owner, it was very important to me to highlight the talents of women,” says the bride.  It was also important to her to dress the part for her own wedding. “After designing for so many others’ special days, I was thrilled to be able to wear something that I created for the biggest day of my life,” says Jovan. She’d designed a bridal collection prior to the wedding, but Kevin had seen the gowns already — and even helped create them. So she needed something new. And not just one, but three.  Let’s start with the bride’s favorite — her couture ceremony dress and veil. They were inspired by the first Sex and the City movie. “I wanted to re-create that moment when Carrie tries on different wedding dresses,” she says. Jovan’s dress was made of feathers and ivory silk taffeta, with a pleated drape and bubble hem.  Kevin didn’t miss the significance of the style. One of his favorite wedding details was seeing Jovan come down the aisle in her gown.  As for the other two? The first was a Justin Alexander design that she’d altered. She decided to wear it on the way to the venue “instead of something like a casual outfit because I was in full bridal mode” and for the first look.  The final costume change was for the reception, into a pearl-filled stunner. Think pearl hand-embroidered lace from Brussels, stringed pearls on the shoulders and sleeves, pearl buttons down the back, and a fishtail bottom filled with pearl-adorned draped godets.  Of course, it wasn’t just about the fashions. There were also sentimental decor touches — the couple used Jovan’s grandmother’s dinnerware, with its pretty floral detailing, at the reception.  And Jovan and Kevin felt all the love from their 76 guests.  “Everyone we invited has a special part in our story, and to see people who have known and supported our love from the beginning was exactly the vibe we were going for,” says Jovan.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:36:00","Oh, baby back!  A frugal feast of Chili’s Grill & Bar chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, salads and more delicious Tex-Mex grub wound up stealing the show at Southern belle Madison Mulkey’s wedding.  The practically minded Savannah, Georgia peach turned to the chain restaurant as a thrifty alternative to traditional catering — which can cost an average of $75 per guest, according to wedding website the Knot.  The spread, which Mulkey shared with her followers on TikTok, where the video has been viewed more than 1.3 million times, wound up a steal at $1,950 for 99 guests — a far cry from the $7,500 Mulkey says she would have had to spend on the usual chicken-or-fish extravaganza.  “First of all, we loved the price point,” Mulkey said in the TikTok. “You really can’t beat that price point. You just can’t.”  But, saving thousands of dollars on her big day came with some surprising hidden costs — Mulkey said she had to spend more time and energy coordinating pickup for the food than if she’d hired someone to worry about it for her.  Savannah, Ga., bride Madison Mulkey’s Chili’s-catered wedding has gone viral on TikTok. TikTok/brideisapersonality  Guests at the wedding enjoyed a wide selection of Chili’s classic Tex-Mex fare. Chili's Grill & Bar  “We had to pick it up pretty early because we didn’t want to pay for the delivery fees,” Mulkey noted.  That meant the bride-to-be wound up waiting at her local Chili’s at 11 o’clock on the morning of her wedding day. Luckily, she was able to corral the crew at her reception location, who made sure the food was hot, ready, and artfully presented that evening.  “That was just a lot more work than we had anticipated,” Mulkey admitted, noting the added pressure placed on venue staff.  And while plenty of Mulkey’s followers saluted her savvy, others expressed concern over the undue burden borne by workers who perhaps weren’t properly trained to prepare and present someone else’s food.  “As someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,” one La-Z-Boy labor expert sniped, calling out the bride for skimping.  Mulkey followed up her first video with a clarification — she did tip the Chili’s kitchen staff $300, and that the venue employees were paid hourly, including for any extra time they may have spent on preparation.  The total bill was an entirely resasonable $1,950.04 — plus the $300 tip Mulkey says she handed to kitchen staff. TikTok/brideisapersonality  Some skeptics remained unconvinced.  “Servers aren’t cooks, they serve people, not serve whatever purpose you need,” a commenter complained.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NoaWxpcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXRvLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtd2VkZGluZy1jYXRlcmluZy1mb3Itb25lLWJyaWRlL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NoaWxpcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXRvLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtd2VkZGluZy1jYXRlcmluZy1mb3Itb25lLWJyaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-10-12","Not Discerned","{""SanDiego"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:57:17","SAN DIEGO — With wedding season in full swing, the planning is on for many couples looking to tie the knot and cement their promise of forever.  Before couples decide on color schemes, flower arrangements and dessert options, the feat of selecting the perfect venue is at the top of most wedding-planning checklists.  There’s good news for those looking to get married in Southern California: San Diego County is isn’t slacking when it comes to majestic landscapes perfect for saying “I do.”  From coastal cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean to green valleys tucked between mountain ranges, here are five wedding venues with a view in the region:  The Condor’s Nest Ranch  This rustic wedding venue sits on a 15-acre property in Pala that beholds panoramic views that span all the way to the coast. Couples can share their vows beneath a 200-year-old ash tree as it sways in the wind to the expression of love. This venue is ideal for those who wish to get married surrounded by nature and views of the countryside.  The Coaster Terrace at Belmont Park  Couples who choose this venue to celebrate their big day can expect white sand views of Pacific Beach. With direct view of the westward ocean, this post could make for a perfect sunset wedding. Another quirky yet #SoSanDiego feature is that the venue is just steps from the giant Dipper roller coaster, which adds to an unforgettable view.  Wild Weddings at San Diego Zoo Safari Park  For some, love can be a wild adventure. Couples can enjoy a “romance safari” with wedding day views of giraffes, zebras and rhinos on an African-like savannah located right here in Southern California at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. The venue area has lush green foliage and there are even options to add-on “wow-worthy wildlife animal presentations,” according to the park’s webpage.  Coronado Cays Yacht Club  This venue offers up a tranquil setting with direct views of the San Diego Bay and Coronado. It’s located right at the edge of the sandy shore, making for great lighting and photo opportunities. This spot could have sailboats poised in the background, birds flying overhead and is simple enough to make the newlyweds the main focus.  Lakehouse Hotel & Resort  This North County venue is located on the edge of Lake San Marcos, offering less salty yet still awing views of the water. Also surrounding the area — green upon green — with golf courses that create a quaint and clean wedding day vibe. Wedding day sights may even include some boating passersby or some lakeside wildlife.  If there’s one thing that’s for certain when it comes to saying “I do,” no matter which San Diego County venue you choose — the view will be a fairytale come true.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvNS13ZWRkaW5nLXZlbnVlcy13aXRoLWFuLWktZG8tdmlldy1pbi1zYW4tZGllZ28v0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy81LXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWVzLXdpdGgtYW4taS1kby12aWV3LWluLXNhbi1kaWVnby9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:21:00","CINCINNATI — From its lush gardens to its historic charm, the Pinecroft Manor at Crosley Estate is beloved by brides looking for the perfect backdrop for their wedding. But property owners are looking for a divorce from uninvited guests.  It’s springtime and, without notice, a black cloud takes over the skies. Made up of tens of thousands of black dots flying in seemingly every direction at once, the cloud settles into a nearby tree branch.  “You’ll hear it before you see it and then there’s a tornado of bees around. That’s how they reproduce, and good luck talking an animal out of reproducing, right?” beekeeper Phil Hucky said.  The bees are searching for their new home and a new place to create a new hive.  Standing inside the attic of Pinecroft Manor, Hucky is faced with cutting out a nearly 100-year-old floor to retrieve a beehive that has built up between the joists.  “This is really the only way to get into a hive like this there’s no access from the outside from underneath anything like that,” Hucky said. “Honeybees are cavity dwellers so they’re looking for a space roughly this big which is perfect between the first and second floor houses the joist space is that size and so they’re looking for those spaces to move into.”  Swarms on trees in a yard or ones that show up on the side of a home or car can often be captured for free by an area beekeeper from the Southwest Ohio Beekeepers Association or SWOBA. Hucky says the association’s website has the resources homeowners need.  “There’s a very large list of people broken up by region local beekeepers that will come and assist you and take that hive off your hands, typically free of charge,” he said.  However, once the bees have found a quarter-inch hole or larger on the side of a home and move into the eaves or walls it can become pricey. There’s no set price within the industry and cutout services can range from a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.  Hucky said homeowners want to make sure they hire someone that understands the construction and has the proper tools for the job.  While someone’s first response to a honeybee swarm might be to grab the insect spray and kill the bees, Hucky said please don’t do it for a variety of reasons.  “If the spray was to kill the hive you still have all that brood and all that honey and it will be like having a large dead animal in the wall,” Hucky said. “If that hives been poisoned, you’re not only poisoning that hive you could potentially poison other hives in the area.”  He said other honeybees will pick up the scent left behind by the propolis in the hive and could visit the poisoned hive and then carry the pesticide to other hives in the area several miles away.    The good news is while honeybees can swarm at any time, they predominately swarm between April and June, which means we’re about midway through this year’s swarm season.  If you find the need for a beekeeper to take care of a swarm in your area, visit the SWOBA website and click the 'Swarm Removal' link at the top of the page.  SWOBA's President Yaser Almusawy encourages property owners to plant bee-friendly flowers. A list can be found on their website.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndjcG8uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy90aG91c2FuZHMtb2YtdW5pbnZpdGVkLWd1ZXN0cy1zd2FybS1jaW5jaW5uYXRpLXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The pageant contestant, 23, who is pursuing her master's degree in theology, wed her long-time partner Taylor Reed Locklear in a ""romantic"" ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on April 29.  The couple exchanged vows in front of 350 family and friends at the historic St. Philip's Church, where they also got engaged a year earlier.  ""My favorite moment on our wedding day was when I walked down the aisle. For me, time stopped,"" Morehouse tells PEOPLE exclusively.  ""As I draped the blusher of my veil over my face, I held onto my dad's arm. The doors to our church sanctuary opened, and Highland Cathedral began to play. While the bagpipes and the trumpet echoed throughout the church, the moment felt very regal.""  The pair's love story began when Morehouse was a high school senior and Locklear had just graduated from the Citadel Military College of South Carolina. They ran into each other at Morehouse's family's annual Christmas party.  The next day Locklear asked Morehouse out to dinner, and the rest was history. ""Since that first dinner, Taylor has always been a constant in my life,"" she says. ""He never lets a day go by without telling me he loves me, and that is a gift I will never take for granted.""  Taylor Rae Photography  The pageant star walked down the aisle on the arm of her father in a custom lace gown featuring a ruffled skirt created by Israeli designer Pnina Tornai, whose designs have been featured on Sex and the City and Say Yes to the Dress. Morehouse carried a bouquet of pink and white flowers and her stunning veil featured a long train that trailed behind her.  Following the nuptials, the newlywed's reception was held at the nearby Hibernian Hall, where guests were led by a bagpiper dressed in a traditional kilt.  ""As the first Miss USA contestant to get married during her reign as a state titleholder, I hope to show women that it is possible to get married and still chase your dreams,"" says Morehouse.  In August 2022, the Miss USA organization announced in a press release that they were changing their rules for contestants. ""Effective with the 2023 Miss USA competition and state preliminary competitions, women who are or have been married, as well as women who are pregnant or have children, will be able to compete,"" read the release.  ""Marriage is a wonderful institution, and I am pleased that the Miss Universe Organization is empowering women to do both,"" says Morehouse. ""My husband's love and support has refined me into the woman I am, so he is certainly on the road to Miss USA with me.""  Juliana Morehouse and Taylor Reed Locklear. Taylor Rae Photography  The couple's reception hall was decorated with pink, lilac and red florals where guests were served signature cocktails — the Queen's Rose for her and the Gentleman's Old Fashioned for him — and treated to a champagne tower poured by the bride and groom.  Meanwhile, their wedding menu consisted of food stations that featured oysters, sushi, beef tenderloin with green beans and potatoes, mac and cheese with the option to add extras such as crab and grits, and scallops with risotto. And to fuel the late-night dancing — with a soundtrack provided by the Soul Psychedelique Orchestra — the celebrations ended with mini cheeseburger sliders.

When it came to dessert, the couple served mini key lime pies and banana puddings as well as their gorgeous, floral-covered wedding cake — a four-tier classic vanilla cake with buttercream icing and carrot cake with cream cheese icing.  For the evening celebrations, Morehouse changed into a party dress and as a nod to her pageant career, she added a light-up tiara and her Miss Maine USA sash.  Taylor Rae Photography  Some of the couple's guests who have a Miss USA connection — including Morehouse's mom, who is a former Miss North Carolina USA — also brought along their sashes and posed for a picture. Other guests were also gifted their very own sashes and tiaras and were snapped tossing a cardboard cutout of Morehouse being crowned Miss Maine USA into the air as they danced.  When planning her nuptials, Morehouse says she wanted a ""romantic, spirit-filled, fun"" day. ""Most of all, I hoped for a day that my husband and I could enjoy with our loved ones, and that we did,"" she adds  The newlyweds are now enjoying their honeymoon in Italy, with stops in Rome, Positano, and Capri, and they are looking forward to their future together.

The prime time of wedding season is upon us and that includes proposals, bachelorettes and of course, the big day. If you fall into one of those wedding categories or just love all things bridal, consider the next few months your opportunity to admire (and silently judge) every wedding trend, choice and dress that you see IRL or online. Weddings are kind of like individual Met Galas—whether you’re attending, participating or just watching from afar it’s fun to have an opinion! Approach the subject with expertise by getting familiar with all of the new wedding trends for 2024. If you’re planning a 2024 wedding, now is the time to understand what themes and trends are on the horizon.  Weddings are, of course, a highly personal event which means that nobody is required or even encouraged to follow trends. These new wedding trends for 2024 simply exist to provide additional inspiration for the wedding day and wardrobe. That being said, the wedding dress trends for 2024 deserve your attention. They are playful, daring, and even a little bit dramatic.  If there’s anyone that’s ahead of bridal trends it’s Hope LaVine, a Los Angeles-based bridal stylist and influencer with over 360k followers across socials. LaVine exclusively covers bridal trends and tries on and reviews new collections herself for an honest first-person perspective. She just returned from bridal fashion week in Barcelona and New York City where she was one of the first to see the designer bridal collections for spring/summer ’24.  According to LaVine, the biggest and most innovative trend to hit the bridal scene in 2024 will be wedding dress separates. And if you’re a 2024 bride, this may work in your favor.  “Social media has told brides that they need to change out of their wedding dress and have a second look or reception outfit. One dress or ‘look’ is no longer enough these days,” LaVine explains. “The bridal designer’s fix for this is offering separates. Gloves, neck scarfs, detachable sleeves, hooded veils, and even transformative dresses. These separates are giving brides their two bridal looks, all within one dress.”  “Galia Lahav is a great example of this.” LaVine continues. ” They have multiple jackets that can be worn with lace long-sleeve jackets, and overskirts and they even have a mermaid wedding dress that becomes a mini dress (pictured above)”.  Versatility is becoming a top priority for brides, especially when a wedding budget comes into play. Another way brides are incorporating multiple looks into their wedding wardrobe is by repurposing older family members’ dresses and accessories. The search for “Repurposing mom’s wedding dress” has over 38.8 million views on TikTok with dozens of viral videos showcasing the process and transformation of vintage pieces.  This viral TikTok video has amassed over 240k likes and documents the process of repurposing a wedding dress from 1988 into a short rehearsal dinner dress with a more modern feel. There are plenty of other videos on the app showing different versions of the same process so it is a great place to look for inspiration if you’re considering doing the same.  If you don’t have a perfect ’80s hand-me-down ready to repurpose, don’t fret! Plenty of designers are incorporating vintage designs into their new collections. The style Hope LaVine is most excited about? Drop waist.  “It’s so interesting seeing the trends cycle back around. Drop waist was very early 2000s, think classic Vera Wang – Victoria Beckham wedding dress. But bridal design trends often mirror fashion trends. With everyone’s resurgence in their obsessions with corsets, it’s no surprise that brides are wanting that snatched look in their wedding dress as well.” LaVine says.  In addition to drop-waist dresses you can expect to see the revival of elegant princess-style gowns, the emergence of capes down the aisle, and the evolution of accessories with a shortened veil in 2024. The good news is that plenty of the trends for 2024 can be incorporated with any wedding aesthetic, so you won’t have to revolve your entire look around one to be able to participate.  Keep reading for the five biggest wedding dress and bridal accessory trends for 2024. Before you know it, these will be on your IG feed too.  Fairytale Princess Gowns  While sleek and modern trend-driven wedding dress silhouettes have been having a moment over the last couple of years, the princess gown has slowly but surely been regaining its power. This dress silhouette capitalizes on the drama and grandeur associated with fairytale romance. The focal point of a princess dress is the large skirt that juts out at the waistline. Beyond this distinguishing feature, there’s plenty of room to customize the style to fit your happily ever after. Monique Lhuillier, for example, featured a dress with a multi-layer tiered skirt and a lace bodice with high-neck and long sleeves in the most recent collection. The dress is reminiscent of old royalty while the skirt detailing makes it more modern. Designer Liz Martinez took a different approach with a simple silhouette but used textured fabric to add dimension to the look.  Dramatic Capes  You don’t need an entire outfit change to make a statement at your wedding. Capes have made a dramatic entrance on the bridal scene. Whether it’s tulle, lace or silk, a cape will elevate your entire bridal look. As presented by Elie Saab, a cape (especially one with a hood) is also a cool alternative to a veil. It will add movement to your look when you walk down the aisle or through cocktail hour and will also look great in photos. One of the best parts about a cape is that they work over a variety of dress silhouettes—if you already have your dress picked out, try a cape over it for good measure.  Flower Appliqués  The flower appliqué or rosette trend is a main character in fashion right now. On any piece of clothing, whether it be a swimsuit, skirt or as demonstrated here, a wedding dress, you can find bold flowers added for extra detail. This is by far the most general trend-driven bridal trend for 2024 but one could argue it’s easily the most natural fit. Choosing a dress with flower detailing can help tie together the overall aesthetic of your wedding. If you’re envisioning a garden party, flower appliqués will obviously fit right in. On the contrary, if you have a very minimalist aesthetic or dress, a large rose, like the one seen at Badgley Mischka, or a cluster of flowers on your shoulder, as shown by Ines de Santo, can add dimension to your look.  Short Veils  Short wedding dresses, specifically for a reception look, are an increasingly common choice for brides—and right along with it we have the emergence of the short veil. The short veil silhouette is both elegant and modern which also makes it a popular choice for the untraditional bride. Unlike a classic long veil, a short veil acts as more of a hair accessory rather than a part of the dress silhouette which is why it’s most usually worn with a shorter or fitted dress style. If you’re planning on changing for the reception or taking a romantic trip to city hall, a short veil is the way to go.  Something (Or Everything) Blue  The tradition of wearing something blue is far from being a trend but having the color incorporated as a main feature in a bridal look definitely is. Brides are embracing the shade and wearing it to compliment classic white bridal pieces. Sareh Nouri’s latest bridal collection does an excellent job of showing how blue can be paired with wedding dresses by adding oversized blue bows, printed fabric or embellished gloves. Oscar de la Renta also has a gorgeous blue lace gown that would work as a wedding dress. The difference between this trend and previous iterations of “something blue” is that these blue pieces are a part of the primary ceremony look and not just used as a subsequent reception accessory.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc3R5bGVjYXN0ZXIuY29tL3dlZGRpbmctdHJlbmRzLTIwMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""If you really, really, really love sliders, and you crave your partner as much as you do the sliders, then it's a match made in heaven,"" Jamie said.Drew and Jamie said ""I Do"" to each other, but also to a giant slider wedding cake, crowns and armor, and around 150 family and friends joining them at their happy place.""I couldn’t wait any longer,"" Jamie said.For Jamie, White Castle isn’t just a place she and Drew eat at hundreds of times per year – it's a home from a time when she didn’t have anywhere else as a physically and sexually abused teen. ""I truly would not exist right now without this company,"" she said. ""I had been kicked out of everywhere I went into. I went into a White Castle; I was welcomed. I was fed, I was given water, I was allowed to use a bathroom. I was treated like a human being.""""When I found out that they were the safehouse for Jamie, before there were safehouses, I became a superfan,"" Drew added. They know a White Castle wedding isn't in the cards for everyone. But they have a message for those that have their own unconventional special spot:""If you have an idea, just go with it,"" Drew said. ""Go bold, do it big, do it exactly how you want.""For their honeymoon, Drew and Jamie plan on traveling to Drew's hometown of Columbus, Ohio. It also happens to be the headquarters of White Castle. So they plan on spending several days going to as many White Castles in the area as possible.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkc3UuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2hpdGUtY2FzdGxlLXdlZGRpbmctYXJpem9uYS80MzkzMTE0ONIBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndkc3UuY29tL2FtcC9hcnRpY2xlL3doaXRlLWNhc3RsZS13ZWRkaW5nLWFyaXpvbmEvNDM5MzExNDg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eventually, I had to move to the backup plan’s backup plan: a little walk in Central Park as the sun set and the park’s night creatures started to come out of the shadows to greet our newly engaged life in a giant rat-and-cockroach-themed musical number.”  Their wedding was held at the Inn at Perry Cabin in St. Michaels, Maryland, where Hanna’s parents have spent many wedding anniversaries over the years. “It’s also very close to where I grew up in Maryland,” she adds. “And where Wedding Crashers was filmed!”  The rehearsal dinner at the Chesapeake Maritime Museum kicked off the weekend’s festivities. Guests, with cocktails in hand, took boat shuttles over from the Inn at Perry Cabin to a picturesque old boat barn overlooking the water. For this—and the welcome party that followed—Hanna wore a slip made from an antique pattern at Jane Bourvis in Notting Hill that her sister-in-law Sophie Dahl helped choose, and she accessorized with vintage pearl drop clip-on earrings that belong to her grandmother.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3cvbHVrZS1rZWxseS1hbmQtaGFubmEtc2l2ZXJsaW5nLXdlZGRpbmfSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2d1ZS5jb20vc2xpZGVzaG93L2x1a2Uta2VsbHktYW5kLWhhbm5hLXNpdmVybGluZy13ZWRkaW5nL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:14:01","The groom whose wife was struck and killed in a car crash in South Carolina on the couple's wedding night has sued the alleged drunk driver and the bars she allegedly drank at before she got behind the wheel, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.  The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, accuses driver Jamie Komoroski, 25, and the owners of five South Carolina bars — Snapper Jacks, The Drop In, The Crab Shack, El Gallo Bar & Grill and Taco Boy, where Komoroski was employed — of negligence and wrongful death in the crash on Folly Beach on April 28 that killed Samantha Miller, 34, of Charlotte, North Carolina, as she and her husband, Aric Hutchinson, 36, were leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart.  The suit alleges that employees of the bars Komoroski allegedly visited the night of April 28 overserved her even though she was “noticeably and visibly intoxicated” and that she got behind the wheel after an alleged “booze-filled day of bar hopping.”  Hutchinson, the groom, was seriously injured, sustaining a brain injury and broken bones. A witness reported that Komoroski “was dazed and confused” at the scene and repeatedly said “I did nothing wrong” and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller at their wedding. via GoFundMe  Hutchinson said Saturday at a memorial in Miller’s honor on Folly Beach that he is feeling “just as good as I can feel with the situation.” He filed the suit both as the representative of Miller's estate and on his own behalf, the complaint says.  Danny Dalton, the attorney representing Miller’s family, said in a statement that the case “is about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly.”  A spokesperson for the state Revenue Department’s alcohol beverage licensing bureau said the state does not require businesses to mandate training for alcohol servers but maintains a list of recommended training programs on its website.  Many states, including South Carolina, allow people to pursue civil actions against businesses that serve intoxicated customers who subsequently cause harm.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm, according to online court records. She remains in custody.  Komoroski’s attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in an email Thursday morning that he was not representing her in the civil case. He said in a statement: “We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.”  The lawsuit also names Komoroski’s workplace, Taco Boy, and an unnamed supervisor of the Folly Beach restaurant as defendants, alleging the supervisor organized a night of drinking for employees before the tragedy unfolded and pressured Komoroski and other attendees to drink heavily. The complaint says the supervisor knew that “Komoroski had a previous history of alcohol abuse,” but it does not elaborate further. It also claims her employers allowed Komoroski ""to simply leave and drive away after having consumed a dangerous amount of alcohol.""  Melissa Reardon, the communications director for Taco Boy, said in a statement that there was no ""organized employee function around drinking"" the day of the crash and that 16 hours of video and interviews with staff members show that Komoroski did not go to the restaurant that day. She added that it was ""untrue"" that Komoroski's supervisor knew anything about an alleged ""previous history of alcohol abuse,"" as the complaint alleges.  Reardon said Komoroski had recently been hired and had trained for only two days before April 28, adding that her employment has been terminated.  ""Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy,"" Reardon said in the statement. ""Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.""  The complaint also alleges that the management of Taco Boy and the managements of the bars Komoroski allegedly visited that night failed to properly train employees to recognize signs of intoxication and prevent overserving.  Reardon said in her statement that restaurant staffers are ""committed to serving alcohol responsibly"" and are required to complete training programs to prevent overserving.  A representative for Snapper Jacks declined to comment and directed calls to a corporate phone number, which no one answered.  Representatives for The Drop In and El Gallo Bar & Grill declined to comment.  A representative for The Crab Shack could not immediately be reached for comment.  Allegations of an alcohol-fueled evening  The lawsuit alleges that Komoroski began her evening drinking at El Gallo Bar & Grill in Charleston before she drove 26 miles south to the city of Folly Beach, where she allegedly drank at three more local bars: The Drop In, The Crab Shack and Snapper Jacks.  “Over the course of several hours, Jamie Komoroski slurred and staggered her way through each of these bars, consuming an assortment of alcoholic beverages, including beer, tequila shots, shift shots of liquor on the house, etc.,” the suit alleges.  “By the end of the night, Jamie Komoroski was grossly and dangerously intoxicated,” it says.  Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, only briefly hit the brakes before her vehicle smashed into the golf cart in Folly Beach, S.C., on April 28. Folly Beach Police Department  Komoroski's blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina, which is 0.08%, according to a toxicology report.  The incident report says she told a sergeant at the scene of the crash — on the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue in Folly Beach — that she had two drinks that night, a beer and a “tequila pineapple an hour ago or so.” Komoroski refused to perform any field sobriety tests, and she was swaying as a sergeant asked her to stand up, according to the incident report.  A sergeant said he “smelled an odor of alcohol coming from her breath and person,” the incident report says, adding that Komoroski was driving 65 mph per hour in a 25 mph zone — and in the opposite direction of her home — at the time of the crash.  A quest for accountability  The lawsuit also names as defendants 20 unspecified “Jane Does” who may have contributed to the events.  Also named as plaintiffs, alongside Hutchinson, are Benjamin Garrett, Hutchinson's brother-in-law, and his son, a minor, who were driving the newly married couple in a golf cart back to their accommodations for the evening and suffered ""terrible and permanent injuries,"" the complaint says.  Andrew Gilreath, the director of the Folly Beach Public Safety Department, has told The Associated Press that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Hutchinson and the other plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit.  Dalton, the family's attorney, said the family hopes filing the lawsuit will allow it to learn more about what happened in the hours and minutes before the fatal crash and who should be held responsible.  “There are still many details we don’t know about the sequence of events leading up to the tragic crash, but by filing a lawsuit, we can begin the legal discovery process that allows us to get the answers that Samantha’s family deserves,"" Dalton said in a statement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUtY291cnRzL2dyb29tLXdob3NlLXdpZmUtd2FzLWtpbGxlZC13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LWNyYXNoLWZpbGVzLXN1aXQtZHJpdmVyLWJhcnMtcmNuYTg1MDMx0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAvcmNuYTg1MDMx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lyndsey McAteer had gastric sleeve surgery to shrink her stomach by 80 per cent in a bid to reach her target weight of 13 stone after a treatment plan and a pregnancy caused her to pile on the pounds.  The mum-of-two, who has endured gruelling chemotherapy and a mastectomy, is now determined to get in shape to tie the knot with her fiancé Martin O’Connor next year.  Lyndsey, from Renfrew, is also training to take part in Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life.  She said: “I still have some weight to lose, but I’m feeling great after losing eight and half stone since my surgery last September.  “I’m getting married next year so I’m determined to get in shape and I’m looking forward to doing Race for Life, I can’t wait. It’s going to be an amazing day and a great way to mark 10 years of being clear of cancer.”  It will be an emotional moment for Lyndsey when she stands on the start line at Glasgow Green ahead of the 5k on May 21. The 40-year-old, who was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer at just 29, knows exactly how vital it is to raise funds for life-saving research.  She took part in her first Race for Life event in May 2013 just two days after her fourth chemotherapy treatment for the disease, and when Lyndsey returned to take part in the event the following year, she met Martin.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey after chemo  Lyndsey after chemo (Image: Supplied)  This year, her sons Harris, 12, and Ellis, seven, are joining her alongside her best friend Ruth Coulter.  READ MORE: Jordan Owens and Christopher Hughes among clients of crime gang  Lyndsey said “I feel like I’ve been beating the odds every single day since my diagnosis.  “I pushed my son Harris in his pram at my first Race for Life. Now he’s at high school and I can’t believe where that time has gone. Race for Life will always have a special place in my heart, but I know being there will bring back a lot of memories. It’s a chance to say thank you, to pause for a moment and to take in everything that’s happened in my life. Life has been a rollercoaster these past 10 years but I feel blessed to be here.”  Story continues  Lyndsey was a single mum to two-year-old Harris when she found a lump in her left breast. Just four days before Christmas in 2012, tests confirmed she had breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and marked her 30th birthday in hospital recovering from surgery.  Before beginning chemotherapy at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, doctors warned the treatment could make her infertile. She was offered the chance to have her eggs frozen but decided against it.  Lyndsey said: “I already had my son Harris.  “I decided not to freeze my eggs as I didn’t want to delay the chemotherapy starting. Doctors told me there was a high chance of the cancer coming back so I wanted to get the treatment started as soon as possible.”  After chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Lyndsey finished treatment in October 2013. And in early 2015, Lyndsey received a wonderful surprise when she fell pregnant naturally with Ellis, who was born in November. Then, to mark five years free of cancer in 2017, on the anniversary of her diagnosis on December 21, Martin proposed.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey and Martin O'Connor  Lyndsey and Martin O'Connor (Image: Supplied)  Lyndsey added: “I was overjoyed.  “Some wonderful things have come from something so awful. When I had chemotherapy treatment at 29, I feared I’d never have another child. But my focus at that time had been fighting cancer. That’s why when Ellis came along he really was a little miracle and a sign that cancer didn’t win.”  Race for Life, in partnership with headline sponsor Standard Life, is an inspiring series of 3k, 5k, 10k, Pretty Muddy and Pretty Muddy Kids events which raise millions of pounds every year to help beat cancer by funding crucial research.

Some of our clients have postponed weddings and are opting for destination weddings at hill stations due to the heat. Shorter guest lists are again in vogue like the pandemic days.” To this Aman added, “The guest list is shorter because hill stations don’t offer as many accommodation options as Kolkata or other metros.”Aman shares that outdoor rituals are being curated more cautiously. “We have to ensure that all venues are well-ventilated so that people don’t fall sick. Water sprinklers are being used for haldi rituals. For rituals happening outdoors, we are covering the area and installing temporary ACs and pedestal fans. We are arranging for daaber jol, lassi, fruit juice, ORS, nimbu paani and water along with hats and wet towels. Keeping hats with names of guests inscribed on them is the latest trend.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL20udGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmNvbS9jaXR5L2tvbGthdGEvcG9vbC1wYXJ0aWVzLWxpZ2h0LWN1aXNpbmUtY29vbGVyLXZlbnVlcy13aHkta29sa2F0YXMtc3VtbWVyLXdlZGRpbmdzLXN1bW1lci13ZWRkaW5ncy1sb29rLWRpZmZlcmVudC1ub3cvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTAwMzIxMzE2LmNtc9IBrgFodHRwczovL20udGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmNvbS9jaXR5L2tvbGthdGEvcG9vbC1wYXJ0aWVzLWxpZ2h0LWN1aXNpbmUtY29vbGVyLXZlbnVlcy13aHkta29sa2F0YXMtc3VtbWVyLXdlZGRpbmdzLXN1bW1lci13ZWRkaW5ncy1sb29rLWRpZmZlcmVudC1ub3cvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwMDMyMTMxNi5jbXM?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-07-01","13:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 21:54:00","Civil marriages are on the rise in Israel, and this Israel-based organization has been instrumental in doing so. Chuppot, an organization that provides private religious services and challenges Israel's Chief Rabbinate, has officially celebrated more than 1,000 weddings conducted.  The organization reported a 30% increase in inquiries to those from last year. Chuppot organizes marriages legally outside of the official rabbinical establishment. Now, couples from across Israel can seek other ways to seek their marriage contract through official methods without jumping through additional hoops.  The reported increase in marriage requests can be attributed to several factors, but the organization believes this can best be attributed to the current state of uncertainty in Israel. As the atmosphere in Israel has recently been identified as tense, especially regarding those of political and religious significance, many Israelis have sought other opportunities to seek marriages.  Though many Israelis identify as Jewish and follow Jewish tradition, they may find it tough to differentiate between their religious identities and that of government actions. Marriage falls into this category. With the push for Israel's judicial reform, secular Israelis and non-Jewish residents and citizens of the Jewish state find themselves grappling with the laws of a ""halachic state.""  Providing suitable alternatives for the Israeli public  As a result, Chuppot has stepped in to provide a legal alternative for those wishing to be married in the holy land, while removing one official step. Since Israelis may later have to deal with the rabbinate for other reasons, Chuppot acts as a different messenger.  Rabbi Aaron Leibowitz, president and founder of Chuppot, made note of the increase. ""Every year we are aware of a consistent increase in inquiries and demands for the service we offer. This year, we've seen a drastic increase in the number of inquiries and interest in the weddings we conduct. These have come in just a few months, towards the end of the Omer and the beginning of the summer wedding season,"" he said.  ""Chuppot as an organization has set itself the goal of 'being a rabbi where there is no rabbi,' according to the religion of Moses and Israel, even if this means that he will not be registered for marriage with the chief rabbinate, Leibowitz added. ""Our activity is carried out of an absolute commitment to Halacha and the laws of Orthodox Judaism. All rabbinic activity within the project is committed to Halacha and takes place without breaking its boundaries.  ""In cases where the couples encounter a difficult and discriminatory policy, the treatment they receive in chuppahs is open and friendly - one that will allow each couple to express their wishes in the design of the canopy and the ceremony.""  Rivka Arbiv, CEO of Chuppot, elaborated on the different types of couples approaching the organization. ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah. These couples chose to make a 'turn,' to recalculate a route and find a solution that would allow them to hold a Jewish-religious ceremony, but to be freed from the shackles of dependence on the rabbinate.""  Arbiv continued, ""There are also couples who choose an alternative to the rabbis for ideological reasons - beginning with the desire to design a more egalitarian or feminist chuppah ceremony. Some are just tired of the Rabbinate.""  ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah."" Rivka Arbiv  Arbiv says that couples fearful of religious coercion have significantly contributed to the increase in these numbers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzM3OdIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMzNzkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""When I got off the phone, I said, 'I think Kensington Palace just called me?' Two days later I was sitting in front of [Harry and Meghan] talking concepts,"" the celebrated photographer exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week's issue.  Lubomirski, 47, looks back at the commission — which he initially thought was a prank — in his new book The Sittings (2003-2023), a collection of 113 of his favorite portraits. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's engagement photos are included in the spread, alongside his images of their royal wedding day in May 2018. Reflecting on how it all came together, Lubomirski tells PEOPLE that the original call came on an emotional day for his family.  L: Caption . PHOTO: Alexi Lubomirski R: Caption . PHOTO:  ""My mum was having a brain tumor taken out, so I was just all over the place. And then my poor brother and sister were looking at me on the phone because it was after 10 hours of waiting for the doctor to call. So I got on the phone and my face was like, 'I'm sorry, what?' My poor brother and sister were like, 'Oh my God, what's happened to our mum?' "" he says.  Their mother went on to a successful recovery, and Lubomirski had the honor of snapping Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 41, at Frogmore House for their engagement in December 2017. The British photographer tells PEOPLE he was inspired by an iconic shot of Audrey Hepburn's husband Mel Ferrer wrapping her in his coat, and he asked Harry to do the same with his then-fiancée.  ""It just popped in my head because I saw his overcoat and I said, 'Can you put that on?' And then everything just starts folding together,"" he tells PEOPLE of the creative process.  Ed Feingersh/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty  That spring, Lubomirski was called back to Windsor Castle to shoot Prince Harry and Meghan's historic royal wedding, summing it up as ""probably the most high-pressure job"" he's had to date.  ""That was a blur,"" recalls the photographer, himself the descendant of a Polish princely house. ""I got about two hours of sleep the night before, thinking to myself, 'Okay, do I have everything? How am I going to get everyone in place? How am I going to make the Queen smile?' ""  Given time constraints, Lubomirski tells PEOPLE there wasn't a second to spare — so he inventively made the most of his time with the newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  ""I'd only had three minutes to get them into the garden, take pictures, and it took three minutes to get them to the garden,"" he says. ""And there was one shot of the couple sitting in the rose garden, which is an image that I got. It was that first time they were alone, as in out of the public site after being married. So it was a really, very special moment, this moment of calm.""  Alexi Lubomirski  Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

He is now slated to become the first person to retain his membership with the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam while marrying a woman from outside the sect. The marriage of Justin with Vijimol has already garnered much attention as the occasion is expected to mark the end of endogamy practised by the community.  After much wrangling with the administrators of his parish, St. Anne’s Church in Kottody, which even witnessed police intervention, the youth is now expected to receive a ‘vivaha kuri’ or consent on Thursday morning. “This is a difficult situation as I am keen on receiving a consent from my Church,” he said.  The stand hitherto  The development assumes significance as the Church has hitherto refused to acknowledge its members’ marriage to those from other sects and made them apply for Permission to Leave Eparchy of Kottayam (PLEK). Mr. Justine, however, could secure consent for his betrothal last month in view of a recent High Court order in this regard.  The Knanaya Catholic community traces its origin back to Jewish-Christian immigrant community that migrated from southern Mesopotamia to the Malabar coast of Kodungallur in AD 345 under the leadership of merchant Thomas of Cana.  On August 29, 1911, Archeparchy of Kottayam, the only archdiocese for the Knanaya members, was formed through a Papal bull for the Knanaya community to maintain their ethnic identity. They formed an endogamous community by not allowing members to marry persons from other Christian communities.  Challenged in 1989  The practice was first challenged by Biju Uthup in 1989 when the Church refused permission for his marriage sacrament citing that Uthup’s grandmother did not belong to the Knanaya Church. The fight was eventually taken up by the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samithi (KCNS), a reformation group.  On the basis of a petition filed by the KCNS on April 30, 2021, the additional subcourt in Kottayam had issued a decree of permanent injunction prohibiting termination of the membership of any person of the Knanaya archeparchy of Kottayam for marrying a Catholic from any other diocese. After an appeal against this order was dismissed by the district court, the Church approached the High Court for a stay on the judgement. A single Bench of Justice M.R. Anitha on March 10, however, declined to stay the lower court order but has agreed to hear the Kottayam archbishop’s concerns.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS9hLXdlZGRpbmctY291bGQtc2NyaXB0LWhpc3RvcnktZm9yLWtuYW5heWEtY2F0aG9saWMtY2h1cmNoL2FydGljbGU2Njg2MjgwMi5lY2XSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwva2VyYWxhL2Etd2VkZGluZy1jb3VsZC1zY3JpcHQtaGlzdG9yeS1mb3Ita25hbmF5YS1jYXRob2xpYy1jaHVyY2gvYXJ0aWNsZTY2ODYyODAyLmVjZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In general, wedding season extends from late spring and continues through early fall, with weddings peaking in June and September, per Brides.com. Most couples opt for Spring and early Fall weddings because temperatures are a bit more comfortable compared to the warmer or colder seasons. When it comes to weddings, some people scope out venues that offer affordability, space for guests, or a place that practically decorates itself with a stunning backdrop. That’s why many couples prefer getting married outdoors. Whether it be a private estate, a public area like a beach, or your own backyard, some cities may be a better option for an outdoor wedding. LawnLove.com compared 200 of the biggest U.S. cities based on eight categories to compile a list of the best cities for outdoor wedding venues. They looked at the quality of outdoor wedding venues, access to wedding planners, sunshine, and other metrics. Best cities for outdoor weddings.

The best venue access for outdoor weddings includes Charleston, South Carolina at number one, followed by Savannah (number. 4), Honolulu (number 15), New Orleans (number 10), St. Louis (number 14), and Las Vegas (number 13). The study found that some smaller cities and suburbs are not so great for nature-themed nuptials, such as Miramar, Florida (number 197), Newark, New Jersey (number 198), and North Las Vegas, Nevada (number 199). They said these cities generally lack venue access, high venue quality, accommodations, and wedding-look resources.

This would take hours as they would have to scroll to find a message that specifically said how they felt.  Now, couples and wedding guests are using Chatbots - and it saves hours.  It is no secret that the age of the AI (artificial intelligence) is upon us and is quickly spreading to all industries.  When most people think about AI, they think of the manipulation of images on social media, virtual weddings, robots taking over jobs that previously belonged to humans, etc.  However, they overlook areas and industries, like the wedding industry, for example.  Couples, who claim to not have the words to write their own wedding vows, have turned to Chatbots to generate it. Although many seem reluctant about this new development in technology, it is becoming widely popular in the wedding industry.    READ MORE | 200 hours, 4 months, 50 000 crystals: Designer's wedding dress sets new world record  According to the Wall Street Journal, ChatGPT is an artificial-intelligence chatbot that is developed by an AI research company, OpenAI, which was released in November last year.  Essentially, it is a language processing tool that is driven by AI technology, which allows you to have human-like conversations and much more, using the chatbot.  The language model can answer questions and assist you with tasks, like writing an essay, coding or even write wedding vows.  A popular wedding-planning website and app, Joy, has incorporated this AI tool to assist couples with writer's block when it comes to writing vows, speeches, toasts, thank-you notes and also coming up with wedding hashtags.

The wedding planning app and website generates vows by asking the person using it to highlight what they love the most about their partner. Then, afterwards, they choose the style of delivery, ranging from Shakespeare, friend, therapist, TikToker, Rumi to pessimistic ex.  For wedding speeches and toasts, the same approach is taken - but, instead of highlighting what you love the most about the couple, you would give details of a memorable story about the them.  It could include how they met, or how you found out that the couple was together. Then, you choose the style of delivery.  The CEO of Joy, Vishal Josh, says he is well aware of people's disapproval of using AI for such sentimental occasions.

He also said they had faced struggles related to ethics.  ""Are we trying to make something which is so emotional and so personal... are we attempting to automate it? We had that struggle.  ""Getting those emotions onto paper is so much harder than any one of us acknowledges,"" Josh told Wired.  Now, although this may seem to be a daunting experience, always remember that it is no different than going on Google and copying a speech, toast or vows - and it is certainly no different than buying a card at the grocery store, with a generated message for Valentine's Day.

Lesbian genderqueer comedian Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in 2021. They introduced Shamash and shared their union in an April 2021 posted stating, “We got married in January and we are very chuffed about it. For the record: this is me gushing. I am full of very positive feelings.”  During their performance in Something Special, Gadsby shared the story of their novelty wedding cake. They said that they and Shamash specifically wanted to trick a Christian bakery into making their cake. They knew that they couldn’t outright ask for it, so they had to be clever.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake, and it worked. I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10.’ Easy, so gullible, will believe anything, Christians,” Gadsby recounts.  Because the cake had to be a novelty cake to divert from the idea that it was a wedding cake, the design they went with what two otters swimming together with a giant shark about to eat them.  Something Special is a departure from Gadsby’s previously serious and at times cynical style. They made a point to make this special a “feel-good show” as a “reprieve” for LGBTQ+ people, who are currently under attack.  “I want people to love what I love, and that’s what this special is,” Gadsby said. “I want people to love what I love, and that’s this moment in my life, that’s [Jenney] and that’s my ability to navigate an interpersonal relationship. And it’s also my ability to experience joy, which is not something I’ve been able to do historically.” They later added, “Other people who aren’t in the community, it’s not for them — they can enjoy it, it is possible — but this is for us.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZ29tYWcuY29tL2FydGljbGUvcXVlZXItY29tZWRpYW4taGFubmFoLWdhZHNieS10cmlja2VkLWEtY2hyaXN0aWFuLWJha2VyeS1pbnRvLW1ha2luZy10aGVpci13ZWRkaW5nLWNha2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","1989-07-10","Not Discerned","{""LittleFalls"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 03:10:00","LITTLE FALLS, Minn. -- Imagine spending the night in a turn-of-the-century lumber baron's mansion. Well, now you can do exactly that.  ""Every year there are folks that stop by and say I've lived here my whole life and I've never been here,"" said Julia Mueller, executive director for Linden Hill Historic Estate. Her group is responsible for preserving and sharing the history of the estate in Little Falls.  On a hill overlooking the mighty Mississippi sit two mansions. A white home belonged to Drew Musser, and a green one belonged to Charles Weyerhaeuser.  In the late 1800's the two men were lumber barons and good friends. So much so that they built mansions next to each other. And that's not all they built.  MORE FINDING MINNESOTA: Iron ore and baseball celebrated at Chisholm's Minnesota Museum of Mining  ""There's a carriage house and a barn and another carriage garage,"" said Mueller.  Their families lived here happily, for decades. When the Weyerhaeusers left, they essentially gave their mansion to the Mussers. By 1989, the families were gone and both homes were vacant. But that doesn't mean they were empty.  The green mansion has been turned into a museum, and pretty much everything you see is as it was 120 years ago. In fact, 95% of the furnishings are original.  ""We actually have over 15 sets of their dishes,"" said Mueller.  Each room offers a story of its own, but the basement tends to stand-out for other reasons.  When the Mussers took over the Weyerhaeuser home, they brought over a little bit of Hollywood. The family was good friends with L. Frank Baum, who wrote ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Laura Jane Musser developed a friendship with Margaret Hamilton - the actress best known as the Wicked Witch of the West. According to Mueller, they went to Hawaii together a number of times.  A stopover next door is another step back in time. Except that the white mansion is more a hands-on experience.  ""We pretty much give you the front door keys and you have full reign of this beautiful 12,00 square foot mansion,"" said Angela Imdieke, assistant director.  Family reunions, high school reunions, and even wedding parties frequently rent out the mansion, and the music room is a popular place.  Imdieke had her wedding here. Their reception was held at the Linden Hill pavilion, which used to be the site of a heated, in-ground pool that the Weyerhaeuser's built in 1910.  There are endless books for guests to peruse. And for those that do spend the night, there's no shortage of bedrooms either - they can sleep 25 people, comfortably.  The hope is that guests develop an appreciation for the past by spending a night in the past.  ""One of our frequently-used phrases around here is 'history matters.' And we want folks to be able to enjoy and interact with history in a positive way,"" said Mueller.  The city of Little Falls owns Linden Hill and it's on the National Register of Historic Places.

Say ""I do"" on May 20. Wait! There's almost no spaces left for marriage registration that day, at any registration center across Shanghai.  520, short for May 20, has become a popular day for Chinese lovebirds to tie the knot. It's in part because it sounds similar to the Chinese phrase ""wo ai ni,"" which means ""I love you.""  Reservations opened one month prior to the date, and almost every space has been fully reserved across Shanghai.  This year's May 20 falls on Saturday, which boosted the popularity of the date.  ""We received reservations from over 100 couples for that day,"" said a staffer at the Yangpu District Marriage Registration Center. ""It marked a significant increase from regular days.""  The Songjiang District Marriage Registration Center has kept 80 slots for the day, which have been fully secured.  ""Other dates such as May 18 are also popular,"" a staffer with the Jing'an District Marriage Registration Center said. ""From now on, it's our busiest time of the year.""  Marriage registration centers said registration services are still available for those failing to secure a slot on the day, but they might need to wait a long time.  ""Every space online has been reserved, and we keep receiving a lot of inquiries from those who didn't get a slot,"" said a staffer with the Minhang District Marriage Registration Center.  ""They may have to wait a long time if they directly visit the center without a reservation, and it's not guaranteed that they'll be able to receive a certificate on the day. So we suggest they pick another date,"" the staffer added.  Getting married on an auspicious date is a long-standing tradition in Chinese culture.  On February 22, 2022, a total of 2,878 couples tied the knot across the city, far exceeding the 857 couples during that year's Valentine's Day.  In Chinese, 2 sounds ""love,"" making February 22, 2022, an extremely popular date to exchange vows.  A total of 2,567 couples tied the knot in the city on May 20, 2020, as ""May 20, 2020"" sounds similar to ""ai ni ai ni wo ai ni"" in Chinese, or ""love you, love you, I love you.""  On January 4, 2013, nearly 7,300 couples in the city said ""I do"" because the date sounds like ""forever love"" in Chinese.  On another auspicious date, October 10, 2010, local authorities registered marriages of 10,150 couples, a record high.

But whilst nothing could be said against Prince Philip's commitment to his wife and his country, his sisters did nothing to help boost his fledging reputation when he married the late Queen in 1947.  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from attending his wedding, in large part because three of them - Cecilie, Sophie and Margarita - had married German aristocrats who became leading members of the Nazi party.  Princess Sophie was even friends with Hermann Goering - the future head of Nazi Germany's air force - and had both Goering and Adolf Hitler round for tea.  Prince Philip's sister Princess Sophie is seen sitting opposite Adolf Hitler at the wedding of Hermann Goering  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from his wedding. From left to right, Princesses Sophie, Cecilie, Theodora and Margarita  Philip's real surname, Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, signified the German blood that ran through his veins.  His father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, was descended from the German ducal house of the same name.  Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Battenburg, also had German heritage and spent part of her childhood in the country.  The Duke of Edinburgh assumed his mother's maternal surname - Mountbatten, an Anglicised version of the German 'Battenberg' - when he married Princess Elizabeth.  After Cecilie was killed in a plane crash in 1937, a 16-year-old Philip was famously pictured at her funeral in Germany walking alongside relatives in Nazi uniforms.  She was killed along with her newborn baby in Belgium aged just 26. The aircraft's pilot had been attempting to land in thick flog.  The depiction in The Crown of the aftermath of her death was slammed by critics for wrongly suggesting that Philip was blamed by his father for her demise.  The connections between Philip's family and the Nazis - facts that in no way called the Duke's own honour into question - were explored in a Channel 4 documentary in 2014.  It revealed the contents of a memoir written by Princess Sophie in old age, in which she told of a private lunch with Hitler and how she thought he had seemed like a 'charming and seemingly modest man'.

In a sign of their devotion to Nazism, Sophie and her husband named their first son Karl Adolf, in honour of Hitler.  Sophie also wrote in her memoir of how she Goering and Hitler had both visited her home.  Goering came for tea in her flat near Frankfurt before the Nazis came to power in 1933.  She wrote: 'He talked a lot about the new political party which he had joined, the ""Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"".  'He was very enthusiastic about it all, especially about the party leader, a man called Adolf Hitler.  'As Germany was going through hard times and there was a lot of poverty and general dissatisfaction everywhere, we were interested to hear about the great improvements his party was planning to do.'  With Goering insistent that she should meet Hitler personally, the Nazi leader then also came to her flat.  'I had been warned he was a vegetarian, and found it difficult to plan an appropriate meal,' she added.  'In those days we had a cook-housekeeper, which was just as well, as my ideas about cooking and housekeeping were fairly hazy (being only 18 at the time).  'We settled for an assortment of vegetables which turned out to be a great success.'  Sophie was careful to mention how she and her husband changed their view of Hitler 'fundamentally' later on, but said they were impressed 'by this charming and seemingly modest man, and by his plans to change and improve the situation in Germany.'

Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg  Philip as a little boy with his mother Princess Alice of Battenburg and his father Prince Andrew of Greece  Princess Theodora of Greece and Count Berthold of Baden on their wedding day in 1931  The meetings prompted her husband to join the SS, and by 1935 he had been appointed as head of the air ministry's research bureau, according to Princess Sophie.  That year, Sophie was pictured at Goering's wedding, with Hitler seen opposite.  Eight years later, Prince Christoph was killed in a plane crash in 1943, after the Allied invasion of Sicily.  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, who was 16 years older then her brother, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.  He was badly wounded while fighting for Germany on the Russian front and ended up turning against Hitler.  The prince was then among the aristocratic German officers who were implicated in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, which was led by Claus von Stauffenberg.  Cecilie had married George Donatus, the Grand Duke of Hesse in 1931 and they both later joined the Nazi party. The couple had four children.  The fourth, an unnamed son, is believed to have been born during the flight on which the 26-year-old Cecilie lost her life.  Donatus was killed alongside his wife and the plane's other passengers.  Princess Theodora, who was 15 when Philip was born in 1921, was the only one of her brother's sisters who was publicly opposed to Nazism.  Unlike her sisters, she and her husband were allowed to attend the the Queen's Coronation in 1953.  But all Philip's siblings were excluded from the royal wedding in 1947, in large part because it was so soon after the war had ended.  In an interview for 2006 book Royals and the Reich, Philip said his family had found Hitler's attempts to restore Germany's power and status 'attractive'.  'There was a great improvement in things like trains running on time and building,' he explained.  'There was a sense of hope after the depressing chaos of the Weimar Republic.  'I can understand people latching on to something or somebody who appeared to be appealing to their patriotism and trying to get things going. You can understand how attractive it was.'  But the Duke did insist that he had never been aware of 'anybody in the family actually expressing anti-Semitic views'.  Prince Philip is seen with his sister Princess Sophie (both centre) in Germany in March 1953  Prince Philip prays alongside his sister Princess Sophie and Greek Orthodox priests outside the tomb of his mother Princess Alice in 1994  The closest sibling in age to Philip was Sophie, who was born in June 1914 - seven years before her brother.  After her husband Christoph's death, she married Prince George William of Hanover, but the union was controversial.  With Prince George's house of Hanover having been the royal house of England's monarchy for more than two centuries until the death of Queen Victoria, the aristocrat sought permission from King George VI to go ahead with the engagement.  But because the UK was still at war, official permission was not given, although Sophie went on to tie the knot in 1946.  Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, wipes his eye as he sits next to his elder sister Princess Sophie in 1994 at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial  She had three further children with her second husband and passed away aged 87 in 2001, after becoming a confidante to Philip in later life.  She stayed at Birkhall with him and the Queen in the years before the Coronation and she visited Britain regularly, becoming godmother to Prince Edward.

"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 06:16:53","PRESS RELEASE Published May 18, 2023 Marketers Media  The rise of virtual guest books is helping couples move towards a more modern and eco-friendly way to capture memories and animate weddings.  --  The world has seen many changes over the past three years, and the wedding industry has been no exception. With the pandemic forcing couples to postpone or cancel their weddings, many have turned to digital solutions to celebrate their special day. One such solution is the digital guest book provided by wed.tv. It allows guests to send messages and photos to the newly-weds through a simple and user-friendly interface.  Wed.tv has been in operation since 2016, but it was only during the pandemic that its popularity began to soar. The site allows guests to connect using a wedding code, which can be any unique identifier, such as the names of bride and groom. Guests can then send messages and photos via their browser, which are then displayed in a gallery that can be viewed online or projected onto a screen or TV like a slideshow. At the end of the wedding, a PDF featuring all the messages can be generated with just one click, providing a lasting memory of the event for all of the guests.  ""Before the pandemic, wed.tv had fewer than 20 guest books created per month"", said Michele Ampollini, founder of the Company. ""However, since the pandemic began, the number of people creating digital guest books has skyrocketed. By autumn 2021, almost 6,000 guest books had been opened, each receiving an average of more than 50 messages from guests. This trend shows no sign of slowing down, even after the pandemic has ended.""  There are many advantages to using a digital guest book like wed.tv:  It eliminates the need for paper, reducing waste and environmental impact.  Unlike a traditional guest book, there are no limits to the number of messages or photos that can be included.  Guests can include selfies and other photos to create a more visual and personalized record of the wedding.  The PDF created at the end of the event can be easily shared with all guests, making it an unforgettable memory for everyone.  Far from being just a digital version of the paper guestbook, Wed.tv can be used as a cutting-edge photo booth alternative and as an engaging animation tool. It's definitely an instrument without boundaries: guest books have been opened in more than 100 nations, the top users being the US, Singapore, the UK, India, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. Guest books are free for up to 50 guests and 250 messages, which is ideal for small weddings. Users can also purchase a premium version for larger events for as little as $29. Because of wed.tv's popularity, the founders are currently developing Guestbook.tv, a general version of wed.tv designed for occasions like birthdays, graduations, celebrations, parties, and other events.  In the words of Laurent Bedubourg, Company's CTO, ""While the pandemic may have accelerated the trend of digital weddings, it is likely that this trend will continue long after the pandemic is over. The convenience and personalization offered by digital solutions are simply too good to ignore. In addition, as people become more environmentally conscious, these platforms will become even more attractive as they eliminate the need for paper and other physical materials.""  Virtual guest books such as Wed.tv exemplify the industry's innovative response to the pandemic's constraints, allowing couples to embrace digital tools and platforms to improve their special day, and showing the adaptability and resilience of the wedding industry in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Phil Bacon, a manual and delivery operator, won the life-changing amount of money.  The jackpot win has already changed Phil’s life, enabling him and fiancée, Cara-Jane Pallett, to have the wedding of their dreams. The lovebirds will tie the knot this summer and start married life in style as they drive away in a brand-new car.  Phil, 35, is a regular bingo player and was enjoying a night out with his friend when he hit the winning jackpot. Phil noticed he was getting closer to a full house, and initially thought he was on to win a few hundred pounds, but as he called house within 16 numbers, he had the realisation that he’d bagged the £50,000 prize instead.  Phil said: “I couldn’t believe it when I won the jackpot. I never expected to win such a huge amount of money, and I’m still in shock. I’ve been visiting Mecca Bingo for a while now and it’s always a great night out, but this is something else. I feel amazing, this has been completely life-changing.”  Tim Perry, general manager at Mecca Bingo said: “Not only is Phil good at matching numbers, but he’s also met his match, and we couldn’t be more excited for the happy couple as they plan their wedding.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdmVudHJ5dGVsZWdyYXBoLm5ldC93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL2NvdXBsZS1kcmVhbS13ZWRkaW5nLWFmdGVyLWdyb29tLTI2OTMxOTgy0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lauryn fires at her mom in a preview clip for ""Mama June: Family Crisis.""  It's safe to say Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Efird wasn't thrilled about the festivities leading up to Mama June Shannon's (second) wedding with Justin Stroud -- or the fact that her mother had another ceremony after already getting married in a courthouse.  In a preview clip for Friday's episode of ""Mama June: Family Crisis,"" Lauryn has a heated conversation -- on her end -- with her mom about having a second wedding and a bridal shower.  ""Why the f--- are you having a wedding?"" Lauryn, 23, tells her mom over FaceTime, to which June replies, ""Because I'm only gonna get married one time.""  ""You already got married though at the courthouse without everybody!"" Lauryn snaps, and June tells her daughter, ""I want everybody there. I want a wedding.""  June and Justin tied the knot back in March 2022 after dating for six months. A year after their civil ceremony, the couple had a second wedding surrounded by friends and family in an intimate waterfront ceremony in February 2023.  During her video call with her mom, Lauryn expresses her frustration that she was told about the ceremony and a bridal shower from Justin's family rather than from her mom.  ""Why the f--- am I finding out from Justin's mother you're going to have a ceremony and f---ing bridal shower?"" she asks June, who says she ""did not know they were going to reach out to y'all on social media.""  ""That's annoying as f---,"" Lauryn fires at her mom. ""It would be nice to hear from the horse's mouth.""  A still ticked off Lauryn then asks June if her upcoming wedding is going to be ""another one of [her] f---ing money pits.'"" While June claims the wedding is going to be on a ""budget,"" the clip shows footage of her talking to Justin about how she wants ""all the bling"" as well as a ""a big cake, a dress, [and] a huge venue.""  Lauryn doesn't seem to believe her mom's words as she tells her, ""June don't never have a f---ing budget. Let's be real, except when it comes to taking care of Alana.""  She then reveals to June that she won't be going to her bridal shower.  ""I already have plans for the bridal shower. So unfortunately, I won't be able to make it, but Doe Doe says she's gonna come,"" she tells June, referencing her aunt Joanne ""Doe Doe"" Shannon, who was sitting next to Lauryn during the FaceTime with her June.  When June asks why Lauryn ""can't make it,"" Lauryn snaps in reply, ""Because I have five kids to f---ing raise, and one of them is yours!""  Lauryn shares four kids with husband Joshua Efirdd: Ella, 5, Bentley, 21 months, and twins Sylus and Stella, who were born last year. She also has temporary custody of June's daughter, Alana, 17.  June suggests that Lauryn bring the kids to her bridal shower -- and they can be ""one big happy family"" -- however, the latter isn't having it.  ""Mama always thinks that she can convince other people who aren't around her 24/7 that she's the best mom out there and that she's all about family and she's all about fixing her relationships,"" Lauryn explains in a confessional. ""I'm gonna tell you what, Justin's family will find out real soon when I don't show up to that bridal shower.""  After June points out to her daughter that she ""was there"" for the big events in her life, including her wedding, and baby and bridal showers and ""needs"" Lauryn to come to her shower, Lauryn says, ""Listen, Junebug. It's not always about you anymore. Okay, you gotta get that through that thick f---ing skull of yours.""  June then asks if Lauryn will let Alana go with Doe Doe to the shower, to which Lauryn replies, ""Well, here's the thing, I would have to talk to Alana and ask her if she wants to come, it's up to her.""

"wedding","1994-09-16","Not Discerned","{""Houston"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:03:00","Anna Nicole Smith's 1994 wedding to J. Howard Marshall captivated fans — and made the icon into a punchline. But 16 years later — and the subject of a new documentary, Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me — perhaps Smith was the one telling the joke.  In 1992, Smith's extraordinary beauty launched her from small-town fried chicken server to worldwide fame, with five Playboy covers and as the face of Guess jeans. Smith then gained small parts in movies such as Naked Gun 33 1/3 and The Hudsucker Proxy. She smoldered from billboards, walked the red carpet at the Oscars and charmed late-night hosts like Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall.  But the whole time, she was hiding a secret: she was in a relationship.  Wearing a 22-carat diamond at age 26, Smith married an 89-year-old Houston oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall in 1994. The groom, one of the richest men in America, was wheeled up the aisle behind his bride as ""Tonight I Celebrate My Love For You"" was played. Doves were released at the end in the empty chapel.  Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG via Getty  ""She was adaptable to get what she needed,"" says Smith's friend Missy Byrum, who insists Smith was single-minded in her devotion to providing a good life for her son Daniel. ""But she could be herself with Mr. Marshall and that made her happy.""  Smith — who is now the subject of the Netflix documentary Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me — met Marshall while dancing at a Houston strip club in the late 1980s and went on their first date in 1991.  Byrum tells the story of their early romance this way: ""Mr. Marshall's mistress had just died. [The dancer] went and had a cosmetic procedure done that was supposed to be a routine cosmetic procedure. But it killed her for whatever reason. Lady Walker was her name.""  Byrum continues, ""Mr. Marshall was very despondent. So his driver took him into [the strip club] Legs, which is where Nicki was working at the time and she met him. She could tell that he was despondent and everything.""  Anna Nicole Smith. DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock  Byrum adds, ""She would have lunch with him and stuff like that — Red Lobster — but she was trying to keep him a secret from the press after she got her cover. She couldn't disclose him to Guess or anybody at Playboy.""  Marshall, Byrum says, paid for some of Smith's surgeries. ""I believe she had already had her third boob job at this point. But Mr. Marshall paid for a fourth. They put two implants in each breast. That's why they were so big."" Eventually Marshall would buy Smith a car, diamonds and a house in Houston where she and Daniel could live.  Smith's uncle George Beall says of his niece (who was born Vickie Lynn Hogan): ""She really loved him! The way he took care of her and looked out for her. She cared about him a lot. She didn't want people to think that she was after his money. Aunt Kay and I both said to Vickie Lynn, 'If you love him, to heck with what people think!'""  Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  Later, while she was living in Malibu with the film producer Ashley Wells Lewis, Smith would say she was being followed regularly, by people who worked for a man with whom Smith was involved.  ""It frightened her,"" Lewis says. ""She never told me who it was. She said, 'Ashley, people, they follow me everywhere I go. Dinner, my friends, they're right with me.'""  She would get home and report to Lewis, ""I lost them. I took lots of cuts and corners.""  The men were possibly working for Marshall, Byrum says, who claims she and Smith would ""hide in hotels where Mr. Marshall couldn't find us and do our crack smoking.""  Byrum — who had her own intimate relationship and informally married the pin-up in a backyard ceremony in 1993 — says Smith truly loved Marshall, but adds, ""she needed more attention than any one person could give her.""  According to Lewis, ""Anna spent her life in pursuit of happily ever after.""  Following Marshall's death at age 90 in 1995, Smith sued in Texas for $475 million, half of the late oil tycoon's estate, but lost in a September 1997 ruling that declared Pierce the sole heir, also shutting out Marshall's oldest son, J. Howard Marshall III.  The court battle took years and included a slew of mudslinging from both sides, with Smith even accusing Pierce of wanting his father dead during one heated May 1998 testimony. That summer, Smith teamed up with Marshall's disinherited older son Howard to sue Pierce, alleging that Pierce conspired for 20 years to take all of his father's fortune for himself. Partly because of complications arising from Smith filing for bankruptcy in 1996, different judges issued contrary rulings, with Smith winning $474 million, then slashing that to $88 million. The case was appealed all the way to the federal Supreme Court, which ruled in Smith's favor.  Pierce died in June 2006 at age 67 from an infection before he could successfully prosecute the case further, but his wife, Elaine, continued on behalf of his estate, even after Smith's death from an accidental overdose in 2007. In 2010, it was finally ruled that Smith's estate was not entitled to any money from Marshall's estate.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9hbm5hLW5pY29sZS1zbWl0aC1qLWhvd2FyZC1tYXJzaGFsbC13ZWRkaW5nc2hlLXRydWx5LWxvdmVkLWhpbS1iZWNhdXNlLWhlLWFjY2VwdGVkLWhlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:49:24","Florida Vow Renewals, Eloping in Florida, and Florida Beach Weddings on a Budget are showcased with Suncoast Weddings Beach Wedding Packages.  This press release was orginally distributed by ReleaseWire  Treasure Island, FL -- (ReleaseWire) -- 05/17/2023 -- Planning a beach wedding offers the opportunity to weave ocean and beach-themed elements into the big day, from seashell-inspired bouquets to elements of decor. Suncoast Weddings, premier wedding planners based on the west coast of Florida, have a team of experts on hand to help guide and advise couples who are looking for creative ways to customize their beach wedding or beach vow renewal to make it unique and memorable. One of the easiest ways to customize the decor is to opt for aisle markers that are reminiscent of the beach. Good examples that are always firm favorites include white starfish, brown starfish, and conch shells. They can be mixed and matched along the aisle if preferred. The conch shells have a blush pink interior and so they are sometimes paired with a blush theme, with either blush chiffon accents on the arch and chairs, or blush chiffon drapes on the arch. A popular arch for smaller ceremonies is the signature Suncoast arch, which has two upright posts. For larger ceremonies with more guests in attendance, couples often opt for the four-post tropical arch. All of the arches, including the two-post bamboo, the four-post bamboo, and the two-post birchwood arch can be draped and decorated in a variety of ways. A crystal chandelier is a stylish addition to the arch, however, in sticking with the beach wedding theme, Suncoast Weddings also have a shell chandelier available for the main event. Shells are also featured commonly in the unity sand ceremony, where the couple pours sands from decorative shells into a heart-shaped keepsake bottle. The sand can be natural, or colored. Mixing natural sand and colored sand creates a pretty layering of the sands within the bottle, as they are poured at the same time. For ceremonies that include children, each child can also have their own shell and unique sand color on the unity sand table, so all of the sands mingle as they are poured. Another way to customize along the lines of a beach-inspired day is the bouquet and boutonniere. Seashells are popular, with a range of shapes, textures, and colors to choose from. In addition to seashells, pearls, starfish, and sand dollars can also be incorporated. Often a bouquet or boutonniere combines an element of the sea, like a seashell, with a more traditional floral component - such as an orchid with a starfish, or a lily with a seashell. The use of pale blue ribbons is another way to evoke the sea and Florida skies. Jewelry is a unique way to extend the theme to the wedding party, with starfish hair pins, seashell bracelets or anklets, and a traditional classic that takes on a new significance at a beach wedding, a pearl necklace. A fun-filled way to take the beach inspiration through to a beach wedding reception is to have a cake which is inspired by either a sandcastle, the ocean, or the beach. From corals, to bubbles, to pearls, seashells, and ombre shades of blue, there are many designs to choose from, with a gallery of inspiration on the social media profiles of Suncoast Weddings. Starfish cake toppers are a particular favorite that always makes family and friends smile. Many of these ideas to incorporate the beach or the ocean theme into a beach wedding can be done in a budget-friendly way. To discuss these ideas and explore more possibilities for a Florida beach wedding that is customized and tailored, contact the Suncoast Weddings team.  All ceremonies can be tailored with Suncoast Weddings, to individualize the decor and details. From small ceremonies for couples looking at eloping in Florida to lavish ceremonies with a hundred guests, ceremonies can be made to be unique.  Permits are required at most public beaches and should be submitted for approval as early as possible in the planning process to make sure that the location and date can be secured. Suncoast Weddings can help with the permit application process and will add the cost of the permit to the personalized proposal, as the cost varies from city to city.  Florida beach weddings and reception packages may start with a search for cheap beach wedding packages however there are many other outgoings that need to be tallied, like the dress, the travel budget, and certainly the reception. Affordable Florida beach wedding Packages typically take several elements of the ceremony and offer them at a reduced price when compared to building the wedding from scratch. This effectively 'bundles and saves' which offers the best value for money for the services delivered. Planning the wedding and reception together as part of a package helps to keep the costs totaled in one place and easier to track. A popular alternative to a traditional reception is a dinner cruise reception sailing the inland waterways around St Pete Beach, Madeira Beach, and Clearwater. This affords a great view of the dramatic and ever-changing scenery as the wedding party enjoys the reception fare. With a choice of paddleboats and sleek modern boats, couples can choose a package and location which suits their style and budget.  Treasure Island Weddings, St Pete Beach weddings, Siesta Key weddings, and Clearwater beach weddings boast spectacular sunset views over the Gulf of Mexico, perfect for couples who want sunset wedding day portraits. Florida beach weddings and reception packages can be purchased which include the ceremony and also the party to follow. This may include items such as a DJ, a custom-made cake, a coordinator for the wedding, and a professional beach wedding photographer.  About Suncoast Weddings  Suncoast Weddings are based in Treasure Island and offer beach weddings in Florida on the sandy beaches of the west coast of Florida in the Clearwater, St Pete Beach, Madeira Beach, Treasure Island area.

Working as a forester in Żółwin close to Bydgoszcz, Adam Kata lost his wedding ring in the year 2000 – just two months after he had got married.  More than just a symbol of love, the ring was an heirloom gifted to him by his late father.Stowarzyszenie Historyczno-Archeologiczne ""Bractwo"" /Facebook  Speaking to the local media, Kata revealed that he had spent a few weeks working as a farmhand in Germany at the start of the millennium. The gruelling nature of the work saw him shed 15 kilos, and it was this that he attributed to the loss.  “When I came back to Poland to work in the Żółwin Forest the ring must have just slipped off,” he said. “I remember delivering firewood to a friend, and when I took off my gloves afterwards the ring was no longer on my hand.”  Before the search began, Kata joked that he would like to see his ring returned.Stowarzyszenie Historyczno-Archeologiczne ""Bractwo"" /Facebook  Desperately searching the forest to recover it, Kata finally conceded defeat after eight weeks.  Now, however, he’s been reunited with the heirloom – gifted to him by his late father – after he corralled metal detector enthusiasts from a historical and archaeological association called Bractwo to help him clean up the forest.

SISTERS star Tammy Slaton has ditched her wedding ring since striking up a romance with her new boyfriend, Greg Morgan, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal.  Tammy, 36, showed off her single status and got caught in new photos while out on a day trip earlier this month to Indiana with her brother Chris Combs, 41.  5 Tammy Slaton has been spotted out and about without her wedding ring Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  5 She did appear to wear some sort of band on her right hand, but has ditched her ring since her split from ex Caleb Willingham Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  The 1000-Lb. Sisters star took a road trip away from her Kentucky home to a Sam's Club in Indiana on May 4 to stock up on groceries and supplies.  She was caught on camera without her wedding ring on her special finger; however, she was spotted wearing some sort of a band on her right hand.  The band on her right hand was visible as Tammy nervously bit her fingernails while on a grocery cart scooter headed into the Sam's Club.  When The U.S. Sun obtained photos of Tammy out on the town back in April, she was spotted wearing her wedding ring despite rumors she had already split from her ex, Caleb Willingham, 40.  The U.S. Sun confirmed the rumors of Tammy's split earlier this month.  ALREADY OVER  An insider exclusively told The U.S. Sun Tammy and her husband Caleb are officially separated and she is in the process of filing for divorce.  ""Tammy has her legal team lined up and is ready to file for divorce,"" the source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star claimed.  ""They split up because Caleb hasn't been following his diet in rehab,"" the insider alleged, adding: ""He has gained 30 lbs and hasn't been working his program.""  ""They got into a big fight over it and he told her he wanted a divorce, but then he tried to backtrack,"" the insider claimed.  Reportedly, Caleb tried to keep their marriage together after the falling out, but it was too late.  ""Tammy's sisters Amy and Amanda were already encouraging her to just move on,"" the source elaborated.  The family insider said they believed that Tammy's decision to end it with Caleb was the right thing for her.  ""She wants someone who can be there for her and his health keeps declining. She would have to take care of him once he's out of rehab, and that is her taking on the care of a whole other person when she can barely take care of herself, so the relationship is pointless,"" the insider added.  ""They got married after just knowing each other over the course of weeks, in rehab, and he's still there,"" the source continued, claiming: ""She didn't want a long-distance relationship and certainly isn't able to care for someone else at this point in her recovery.""  The insider added that Tammy's assets are protected though, and alleged Caleb signed a prenuptial agreement.  Tammy's rep and Caleb did not respond to requests for comment.  REBOUND ROMANCE  Multiple sources claim Tammy has been secretly seeing Indiana-based TikToker Greg Morgan after meeting him on a dating app.  One source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star said: ""Tammy met Greg on one of the apps, and they immediately hit it off.""  The source added: ""They've been seeing each other for about a month now.""  ""He's come to see her a handful of times and takes a six-hour bus from Indianapolis to visit her in Kentucky,"" the insider claimed.  During one recent visit, Greg even met Tammy's family.  The source said the new couple stopped by her sister Amy's home for a visit, and Greg met her nephews Gage, 2, and Glenn, 10 months.  A second insider claimed Tammy paid for his bus rides to her town.  ""They've been talking regularly and they seem to really like each other, but they are trying to figure out when he'll visit again, because things get tough around her filming schedule,"" the second source said.  The first source added: ""Tammy is shy around him and didn't want to eat in front of him. She said she finds him very attractive.""  Greg and Tammy have also publicly communicated over TikTok, and she has commented on his page: ""Aww you love me.""  5 When Tammy was out and about last April, she was still spotted sporting her wedding band on her left hand Credit: Matt Symons for The US Sun  5 Tammy is reportedly seeking to divorce Caleb after being married for only six months Credit: Michael Moretti","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE0NDQwOC90YW1teS1zbGF0b24tc2luZ2xlLXJpbmctcGhvdG9zLWJveWZyaWVuZC1leC1jYWxlYi13aWxsaW5naGFtL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE0NDQwOC90YW1teS1zbGF0b24tc2luZ2xlLXJpbmctcGhvdG9zLWJveWZyaWVuZC1leC1jYWxlYi13aWxsaW5naGFtL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2019-11-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 17:11:00","The sole holdout juror in Lori Vallow Daybell’s murder trial revealed the chilling evidence that “disgusted” him in court — an experience he described as putting a “face to evil.”  Vallow Daybell, 49, was convicted last week of multiple counts of murder and conspiracy tied to the deaths of her daughter Tylee Ryan, 16, son Joshua “J.J.” Vallow, 7, and her third husband Chad Daybell’s late wife, Tammy.  In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired Wednesday, juror Saul Hernandez said he was initially unconvinced that the Idaho prosecutors had proven Vallow Daybell’s guilt.  But just a few hours into deliberations, he was swayed by gruesome evidence that made it “harder to look at” the mom.  “Growing up, you talk about good and bad, God and evil. And I think for the first time in my life, I put a face to evil,” Hernandez said.  The juror recalled how he was “disgusted” by photos of the couple happily dancing at their beach wedding in Hawaii in early November 2019, just a few weeks after Tammy Daybell mysteriously died.  Hernandez said he “didn’t want to look at” the chilling pictures.  Saul Hernandez sat down with “Good Morning America” following last week’s verdict. ABC News / GMA  The loved-up snaps show Vallow Daybell and Chad grinning and holding hands with leis around their necks.  Investigators believe that Tylee and J.J. — who were last seen in September 2019 — were also dead by this point and had been buried in shallow graves on Chad’s Salem property, where they were found several months later.  “I just couldn’t believe how someone can be that happy when your kids are in the ground. And the person that was key in all of this is sitting across from you, smiling at you and dancing with you on the beach,” Hernandez said of the callous pair.  Hernandez said he was “disgusted” by Vallow Daybell and Chad’s wedding photos. ABC News  Throughout the proceedings, the mom’s defense team attempted to portray her as a loving and devout mother who was manipulated by Chad, a noted doomsday author.  Ultimately, however, Hernandez said he bought the prosecution’s argument that Vallow Daybell was a wannabe cultist driven by “money, power, and sex” to kill her children and conspire to help Chad murder Tammy as well.  Following seven hours of deliberation, Vallow Daybell was found guilty by the jury.  “They wanted to believe something that only applied and benefited them, only applied and benefited those people they liked, their circle that they liked and they wanted to be around,” Hernandez said of the couple’s pseudo-religious fantasies.  Lori Vallow Daybell faces the possibility of life in prison without parole. via REUTERS  He noted that he thinks Vallow Daybell’s beliefs — which included predictions of Jesus Christ’s second coming in 2020 — started as “curiosity” but became more intense “once Chad came into the picture.”  “I don’t think, as a human being, you are ever really prepared to experience this,” Hernandez said of his time on the high-profile case.  Vallow Daybell faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow were last seen in September 2019.  The killer mom barely suppressed a smug grin in her new mugshot from Madison County Jail, where she was booked after the verdict.  Meanwhile, Chad Daybell is set to be tried on a similar slew of charges at a later date.  In a statement following Vallow Daybell’s conviction, the Madison and Fremont County prosecutors said they were still “committed to pursuing justice” for the three victims.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2xvcmktdmFsbG93LWp1cm9yLXdhcy1kaXNndXN0ZWQtYnktZG9vbXNkYXktbW9tcy13ZWRkaW5nLXNuYXAv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbG9yaS12YWxsb3ctanVyb3Itd2FzLWRpc2d1c3RlZC1ieS1kb29tc2RheS1tb21zLXdlZGRpbmctc25hcC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""FollyBeach"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:45:00","FOLLY BEACH, S.C. (WCSC) - A man involved in a Folly Beach crash on his wedding night that killed his bride and injured him and two others has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the accused driver and several Lowcountry restaurants and bars.  On April 28, Aric Hutchinson, his new bride, Samantha, and two others were traveling down Ashley Avenue on Folly Beach in a golf cart when they were hit by a gray Toyota Camry.  Police identified the driver of the vehicle as Jamie Komoroski. She has been charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death, according to jail records.  The newly filed lawsuit alleges Komoroski had a “booze-filled day of bar hopping” and the establishments she visited that day had an obligation to “exercise due care” in serving alcoholic beverages. In addition to Komoroski, the lawsuit names Snapper Jacks, The Drop-In Bar and Deli, The Crab Shack, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Holdings, LLC.  Court documents allege Komoroski started drinking at El Gallo Bar and Grill before going to Folly Beach and visiting several bars on Center Street.  Attorney Danny Dalton answered questions Wednesday afternoon about the newly-filed suit. He said they began an investigation into the details leading up to the crash.  The husband of the newlywed killed on their wedding night on Folly Beach in a DUI crash has filed a lawsuit.  “There’s still facts and a lot of questions that haven’t been answered, which is part of the reason we wanted to file the lawsuit, was to get into the formal discovery process where we and the families can get more definite answers to some of the questions that are still a little vague to us,” he said.  Each of the named establishments “should have known that they had the authority and obligation to train, control, and supervise their respective employees, agents, or servants, including any bartenders, servers or any other employee” to not overserve patrons alcohol and not place others at risk of incurring serious injury or death, the lawsuit states.  In naming Taco Boy, the lawsuit states Komoroski had been an employee for a short time. The lawsuit alleges the restaurant was negligent by “organizing, arranging, and supervising an employee function/meeting knowing that excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages would be purchased for, served to, and/or consumed by the employees attending the function/meeting.”  “What our investigation yielded was that she had been an employee of [Taco Boy] for a short period of time, not very long, and that there was an almost routine gathering to go out to bars or a bar after their shifts or, you know, in the middle of their shifts or at different times, and their supervisors would also attend those gatherings or those events, call them what they were, and that she had attended this and that there was significant drinking at that event,” Dalton said. “And so, there’s a responsibility, especially when you have a supervisory role, but as an employer, to act responsibly in that role as employer and supervisor, and we felt that that was not done here and that it was breached.”  insert (Folly Beach Police)  Taco Boy releases statement after being named in lawsuit  Taco Boy spokesperson Melissa Reardon released a statement Wednesday afternoon on behalf of the restaurant stating that Komoroski was not in their restaurant and was not served alcohol there on the day of the fatal crash. The statement also denies there was any “organized employee function around drinking.”  Here is their full statement.  On the day of the accident, Friday, April 28, 2023, we can confirm with absolute certainty that Jamie Komoroski did not set foot in Taco Boy, nor did anyone on our team serve her alcohol at the restaurant. We have confirmed this by watching 16 hours of video footage from multiple cameras, staff interviews with everyone working that day, and by reviewing all sales receipts.  Miss Komoroski had been recently hired at Taco Boy and had trained for only two days prior to the accident. She passed her background check and there were no red flags that would indicate ineligibility for employment. She has since been terminated.  The lawsuit alleges an officially organized employee function around drinking, which we can assure there was no such thing.  We are committed to serving alcohol responsibly and take it very seriously for the safety of our staff and guests. We require that our employees ID everyone and our staff are all ServeSafe /TIPS alcohol training certified before they are allowed to serve guests. We take great care not to overserve anyone.  Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy. Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.  Authorities release BAC of alleged drunk driver in crash that killed newlywed  The toxicology report from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division states that Komoroski had a blood alcohol level of 0.261% when she was tested after the April 28 crash with a golf cart on Folly Beach. That is more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina.  Along with the toxicology report, the Folly Beach Police Department also sent an updated report of the incident.  Immediately after the crash, officers asked Komoroski what happened to which she replied, “I was driving, and then all the sudden something hit me,” the report reads.  Also, in the report, multiple witness recall seeing Komoroski “dazed and confused.” At the scene, she kept asking for her boyfriend and telling the witnesses she was on her way home, the report states.  Once she saw the victims on the ground, Komoroski started screaming and asking what happened, witnesses say.  In Komoroski’s arrest affidavit, officers claim they could smell alcohol on her breath and person. She told officers she had a beer and a drink with tequila about an hour before the crash, the affidavit states.  When asked how she felt on a scale of one to ten, with one being completely sober and ten being the most impaired, she responded that she was at an eight, the affidavit states.  Komoroski was then asked to complete a field sobriety test but she refused, the affidavit states. However, her blood was sampled for the toxicology report.  Komoroski is charged with DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and reckless homicide. Police say she rear-ended a golf cart with her car in the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue.  At the time of the crash, Komoroski was driving 65 mph, according to police.  GoFundMe raises nearly $725,000  In a May 8 update from Hutchinson’s mother, Annette, on the GoFundMe page said he was recovering at home from multiple broken bones.  “From the accident, Aric received multiple injuries including two broken legs, one which had to be surgically repaired,” Hutchinson said on May 8. “Broken bones in his face which also had to be surgically repaired. Broken vertebrae in his back, brain bleeds, and numerous cuts with stitches. He is physically recovering at home while trying to come to terms with the loss of his beautiful wife. Now he is doing the unimaginable of planning Sam’s funeral along with her family.”  The lawsuit was also filed by the other two injured in the crash.  Copyright 2023 WCSC.

But the influencer is as calm as can be ahead of the big day. In fact, Tadhg has had great fun planning his and long-time girlfriend Alannah Bradley’s nuptials.  Today's top videos  It’s helped that Alannah is just as laid back as her soon-to-be husband. Speaking to EVOKE as he does the final checks ahead of tying the knot in Kerry, Tadhg could not praise his fiancée enough.  ‘Alannah is the opposite to a bridezilla, she’s very easy going and said “whatever you like, go for it” so I’ve picked the flowers and the band. She went “that’s grand” and there’s been no stress and no panic,’ he gushed.  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  He continued: ‘It was gas actually, the girl who’s doing the flowers said to me “it’s normally the bride and not the groom calling in” but this has worked perfectly for us.  'There’s only a couple of weeks to go now but I’d say it’s butterflies more than nerves. It’s exciting but a little stressful at the same time because the list is never ending. But there’s no need to stress, you know who’s coming.'  Although Tadhg and Alannah have been together for over 10 years now, she’s very private and only makes rare appearances on his social media.  Tadhg jokes that Alannah is his ‘biggest critic as well as supporter’ when it comes to posting online and that they’ll be leaving the camera work to others at their wedding which has lots of nods to their personalities and shared love of animals.  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  ‘The dogs are a massive part of our life - we've just got a new puppy two weeks before the wedding! And Otis helped me propose, he had on a little tux and the engagement ring was in a box on him, he was my wing man, so they’ll be a big part of the day,’ Tadhg said.  He added: 'The priest told us to make sure the day was about us as well and not all about the dogs but it wouldn't be our wedding without them.'  After the church service the couple are celebrating at The Dunloe Hotel and are using lots of local suppliers and people they know for their big day. For example, Tadhg’s aunty has offered to do the canopies and coffees.  And anyone who follows Tadhg on social media knows that his dad Derry loves to get involved so it’ll come as no surprise he’s been very hands-on with the wedding planning.  Just recently a video of Derry on the kitchen floor trying to suss out the seating plan had thousands of Tadhg’s fans in stitches and anyone who’s ever tried to navigate family dynamics and feuds will relate.  Tadhg said: ‘Myself and my dad have had an input in everything. Alannah and I actually took our parents along to the food tasting with us, which was nice to have their opinions.’  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  When it comes to Derry’s role on the wedding day, he’ll be making a father-of-the-groom speech and Tadhg knows one thing for sure - there’s going to be tears!  Derry told us he’s not overthinking the speech and will instead: ‘Wing it and speak from the heart… but I’m an emotional person.

Having just received an award, Meghan will soon be celebrating her fifth wedding anniversary with Prince Harry.  On Tuesday night, the 41-year-old was honoured at the Ms Foundation for Women's 50th-anniversary gala event in New York – and there was a sweet moment on the red carpet between the couple.  WATCH: Meghan and Harry make very unusual entrance at Ms. Foundation Awards  Meghan was seen looking adoringly at Harry as they stopped to pose for pictures. Watch their unusual arrival at the event in the video above…  Unfortunately, moments after the event, the couple and Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, were involved in a ""near catastrophic car chase"" involving paparazzi photographers. In a statement, the spokesperson said: ""Last night, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers. While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone's safety.""  The couple tied the knot on Saturday 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Sharing the private wedding speech for the first time, Meghan said that she gave it on the night of her wedding to Harry, describing doing so as ""atypical"" for a bride in the UK. Meghan first read the speech to her friends and family at their wedding in 2018. She said: ""I gave a speech the night of our wedding which is atypical for a bride in the UK I think."" To which, Harry said: ""Very"".  © Getty Meghan and Prince Harry out in New York on Tuesday night  Meghan also revealed that she keeps her speech on her phone, and then began to read it aloud. ""On to the crux of why I wanted to speak tonight. First of all, it’s been a while (that got a big laugh),"" she said. ""But mostly I wanted to share a story, a story that I wrote about the man that I love and the way that we met. Let’s call this a modern fairytale.  ""Once upon a time there was a girl from LA, some people called her an actress, and there was a guy from London, some people called him a prince. ""All of those people didn’t fully get it, because this is the love story of a boy and girl who are meant to be together.""  © Netflix Harry and Meghan tied the knot in 2018  Continuing the speech, Meghan said that ""when the tides were rough, they squeezed each other tighter"".

And when the tides were rough, they squeezed each other tighter, nothing can break us, they'd say, for this love she was a fighter.""    © Netflix Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are now parents to two children  She added that ""above all, love wins"" as she described Harry as her ""treasure"".

Since this is wedding season around the world countless ceremonies are being celebrated as couples state their vows to honor, love, and cherish their intended. It is the hope of most couples that these most important of important moments be witnessed by those who have made the biggest impression on their lives.  For those who have a parent that has passed away, the wedding day can be bittersweet. While the joy of a new union fills the air, there is a sense of melancholy that persists because of those that are missing. But, are those dearly departed truly gone?

A Tik Tok video posted by the husband and wife photography team at Danleigh Videography may have given us visual proof that those who love us from beyond the grave are still very much a part of our lives.  In the video shared on the Tik Tok social platform, you can see and hear the mother of the bride reflecting and lamenting the sadness that the bride's father could not walk her down the aisle. Then, ""Dad"" makes his presence known.  In Louisiana, we would call that kind of moment a frisson moment. The kind of moment that gives us chills. But not cold chills, the kind of chills that warm us up from the inside.  As the Mother of the Bride was speaking of her late husband and the bride's father you can hear the sound of a random candle breaking. Some might call that a coincidence. Others, myself included, call that unconditional love. The kind of love that a father has for his children. The kind of love that can't be contained by death.

The specific dress in question? A long-sleeve, corseted pale gold ball gown with light blue and gold embroidery, complete with a sparkling removable blue cape. In fact, Queen Charlotte's wedding dress has made such a splash that the creators of Bridgerton, in collaboration with Allure Bridals, are set to release a collection inspired by the fictional character herself.

And while selecting a ceremony gown and tuxedo is an extremely important task, for those who are currently planning multiple events, there are several other outfits you need to consider. From what you'll wear to the engagement party and the rehearsal dinner to outfits for the bachelor or bachelorette party and post-wedding brunch, your complete wedding wardrobe is an opportunity to showcase your personal style and create a cohesive look from start to finish.  With all this in mind, it's normal to feel a lot of pressure when attempting to curate the ""perfect"" capsule wardrobe. Not only will you need to coordinate with your partner, but you also have to consider your personal aesthetics, each event's theme, where they'll be held, and the level of formality, among other things. Before you get completely overwhelmed, though, we'd like to highlight that these supplementary outfits provide you with the freedom to test out new fashions and reflect your status as the bride or groom. It's also your chance to incorporate pops of color, seasonal fabrics, or trending accessories that may not be suitable for your actual nuptials. Sounds fun, right?  Ahead, we spoke with two stylists for their expert advice on planning the ultimate wedding wardrobe. Here's everything you need to know, from when to buy your outfits to styling tips to remember.  Meet the Expert Hope LaVine is a bridal stylist based in Santa Monica, California. She’s also a content creator that provides brides with wedding inspiration and advice via her TikToks, quizzes, and Pinterest boards.  Raina Silberstein is a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper based in Los Angeles, California. She helps clients define their personal style and build a wardrobe for work, special events, and more.  PHOTOS BY ADRIANA RIVERA and REBECCA YALE PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Consider When Planning Your Wedding Wardrobe  Before you start shopping for your wedding wardrobe, both Rania Silberstein, a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper, and Hope LaVine, a bridal stylist, recommend deciding on an overall creative vision. That way, you can select outfits that complement the vibe of your events while also taking the season, level of formality, and event design into consideration. For instance, if you’re planning a party on the beach, “an overall relaxed style may be best,"" Silberstein says. ""Opt for lightweight textiles like a linen suit or take cues from the coastal color palette. Planning a downtown city celebration? Neutrals and shine make a chic formula along with sleek silhouettes that mirror the architecture.”  Silberstein also advises couples to use their personal style and everyday wardrobe as inspiration. “If you often choose bold styles in your wardrobe, forgo traditional options like a white gown or black tuxedo,” she explains. “I would avoid trying something entirely new and out of your personal comfort level, whether that is a color, pattern, texture, or silhouette.” That’s not to say you can’t experiment with your ensembles, but the key to creating a fantastic look is by bringing together fashion elements you already love with a few statement details.  Lastly, you’ll want to think about wearability. “I would want to invest in high quality, gorgeous pieces that I would wear in new ways,” LaVine says. “I think your wedding wardrobe should be pretty interchangeable—a corset you wore for your bachelorette, then wear on a Friday date night with the spouse. I think if we invest in better quality pieces up front, then we will have it in our closet forever.”  PHOTO BY ADRIANA RIVERA; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  When to Buy Your Wedding Wardrobe  While it’s highly recommended that you buy a wedding dress or suit several months before the big day, the shopping timeline for your other celebrations isn't as restrictive. Specifically, Silberstein suggests that couples purchase their outfits in the same season as their events. “By sourcing your outfit closer to the event date, you discover relevant styles, colors, and textiles for the time of year,” she notes. “Resort styles may appeal for your summer tropical welcome party, while rich velvets are beautiful for a winter engagement event.”  She further notes that everyone should book their venue spaces before deciding on their outfits, as the location “will set the tone for the entire event from the design elements to the overall vibe. The wedding attire should complement the vision too.” Finally, once you’ve secured dates for your events, Silberstein and LaVine both recommend finalizing your outfit about two to three weeks beforehand to allow for any potential outfit changes, alternations, and delayed shipping.  For the bride, LaVine suggests purchasing a wedding gown first before you focus on anything else. “After that, I like to switch back to more ‘high stakes’ looks like rehearsal dinner and reception (if there is a dress change),” she says. “After securing those outfits, I tend to prioritize the bachelorette party looks last. They’re a little easier to buy for and have tons of options out there.” As for the groom, LaVine recommends that his look should not only compliment the event's aesthetic but should also pair well with the bride's attire—meaning, the groom should purchase his outfits once everything else has been locked in.  How to Make Your Wedding Wardrobes Cohesive  A bride’s look tends to take top priority for most wedding events, but it’s important to put some thought into the groom’s pieces as well. Though being matchy-matchy isn’t the right choice for every couple, planning out looks together prevents any potential clashes and ensures complementary styles—this is especially important when you consider how highly photographed all of these events will be. According to Silberstein, you should start by selecting adjectives that best describe your desired aesthetic to help guide your wardrobe choices. For example, “If the special day is supposed to be fresh, bold, and relaxed, a whimsical floral dress and vibrant suit may be favorable,” she says. “By following this unofficial dress code, the partners guarantee a cohesive, personalized, and special event wardrobe.”  LaVine also suggests couples adhere to the same level of formality, whether that’s black-tie or casual, and a similar color scheme. “When wearing white to the wedding events, you really want to match your whites down to the tone—cool white, warm white, or neutral white. And if the bride is in ivory, we definitely don’t want the groom in white or anything drastically different,” she explains. ""Pastels tend to be more casual, and jewel tones [feel] dressier. Neutrals work both ways, but it depends on the styling.” Aside from color, the experts go even further to share their top style suggestions for each event, as highlighted below.  For the Engagement Party  There’s no better way to show off your new relationship status than with an engagement party. Since this is the first of many wedding-related celebrations, LaVine suggests that brides keep their styles relaxed and playful. “I love a fun midi dress for a bride. It’s somewhere in between sophisticated and fun. Maybe the trim of the skirt has feathers, or the straps have pearls. For styling, you could also go with a fun shoe if your dress leans more simple,” she says. As for the groom, the stylist recommends going for an equally sophisticated look, like “a well-tailored black trouser, nice t-shirt or polo, and a loafer.” And to tie both looks together, the groom should consider matching his shirt with the color of the bride's dress or shoes.  For the Bridal Shower  Bridal showers are typically daytime events, which means a light color palette, textured fabrics, and romantic silhouettes are all appropriate sartorial choices. Silberstein says, “If the bride is attending a tea party event hosted by her family and friends, a white long-sleeve lace midi dress with nude ankle strap heels would be an elegant choice.” In this case, she also recommends advising guests to wear pastel hues to guarantee great photos and a cohesive theme. As for accessories, “This would be such a special day to wear family heirloom pieces or something of sentimental value. Especially with all of your family around you,” she adds.  Though a groom’s appearance may be brief at this event, he should still dress in a complementary outfit. A button-down shirt and dress pants, in a similar color scheme or texture as the bride’s ensemble, would be perfect for this occasion.  PHOTOS BY KT MERRY AND LAUREN FAIR PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  For the Bachelor and Bachelorette Parties  Whether you’re having a joint celebration or separate events, get creative with your bachelor and bachelorette party ensembles. “This is such a great time to play around with different styles and types of looks,” LaVine notes. “For my brides, I love seeing some different pieces like a blazer dress, a jumpsuit, or a two-piece set. We can get super creative here and have fun.” She also notes that brides can include at least one statement piece, like ""a fun heel wrap-up, feathers, or bows.” For the groom, LaVine recommends trying out different fabrics, opting for linen pants over jeans, or a leather jacket instead of a blazer. “Obviously, grooms don’t typically try and wear white their whole bachelor trip, but you can still stand out with something fun, like a floral or a chic neutral-on-neutral look,” she says. “Cream jeans and a cream t-shirt make for a very versatile outfit that can be worn for any bachelor trip moment.”  Planning a themed night out? Add some playful corresponding details to your look. For instance, if you’re hosting a bachelorette weekend in Nashville, Silberstein says, “The bride can wear a white denim jacket and white denim mini skirt, set along with white cowboy boots to walk down Broadway in style.""  For the Welcome Party  If you’re planning a wedding outside of your city, it’s common practice to host a welcome party for your guests. And since this is the first time you can really shine a light on your bridal and groom fashions, stick to silhouettes and color palettes that complement your venue or event theme. What's more, LaVine advises couples to embrace a casual dress code, as a welcome party is “a raw, stripped-down time to just show the couple and their love.”  She loves the idea of a bride in a maxi gown paired with a soft beauty look and the groom in a coordinating outfit, which may include a “quality khaki or cream pant and white button down, slightly unbuttoned, with a beautiful brown loafer.” Remember to be mindful of the season, though, as some colder months may call for longer hemlines and thicker fabrics.  For the Rehearsal Dinner  The rehearsal dinner is another opportunity to preview your wedding aesthetics. “This night is truly connected to the next day, so I like to incorporate small elements of the bridal look into the wedding look,” LaVine says. “For example, if your bridal gown has lace on it, it would be really interesting to have a simple gown and add a touch of lace through a glove or long sleeve.” She also suggests that brides opt for an “effortless, yet put together” outfit that perfectly blends their bridal status with their personal style. Some elegant options include a floor-length gown, an embellished midi dress, or a satin jumpsuit.  Although the bride commonly wears white on this night, there's no reason why the groom can't consider a more colorful look. Whether that’s adding a navy jacket on top of a white button-down or donning a jewel-tone suit, the bolder color scheme will make a bride’s white ensemble pop even more. As for accessories, LaVine says that the groom can keep it simple, opting for no tie, no vest, and leaving the top few buttons of his shirt open for a formal yet relaxed look.  For the Farewell Brunch  After a late night of celebrating their nuptials, many couples will prefer a slightly more casual dress code at their post-wedding brunch. While the attire for this event can vary, you’ll want to prioritize comfort and opt for a look that's functional yet stylish. “For my brides, I always recommend comfort here! Whether that’s a chic bridal short and lace top, a jumpsuit, or a silk flow slip dress,” LaVine says. For the groom, attire suggestions also fall into the relaxed category. She suggests “a linen pant and button down, or floral or lace fun shirt with a quality jean” for a simple look that still feels wedding-worthy.  Additionally, Silberstein recommends that couples “begin their marriage in a matching monochrome color palette.” White or neutrals are typically the favored option, but consider incorporating a seasonal color into both of your outfits for a statement look that's still cohesive. Jewel-tone hues, like dark purple, burgundy, or forest green, are excellent choices for a fall or winter event, while spring and summer call for pastel colors like light pink, sky blue, or yellow.

Dottie Fideli was one of those girls and has been dreaming of her ultimate wedding day her entire life.  Now at age 77 she's said 'sod it' to waiting around for a man and has married herself in the ultimate act of self-love at her Ohio retirement home.  Speaking to NBC local affiliate WLWT5, the grandmother revealed she finally had the chance to have the wedding she had always dreamed of.  Advert 10  ""This is something I’ve always wanted,"" she said.  ""I wanted to get married and have a happy life but things didn’t work out that way and now I have a second chance in doing something that’ll make me happy.""  Credit: Donna Pennington  ""I told my daughter, I said, ‘This is the best thing that I’ve ever had, outside of having you kids',"" told the Today show.  Advert 10  Ms Fideli had been married once before, back in 1965.  But the ill-fated nuptials were never meant to be.  After she and her ex-husband exchanged vows at a courthouse, 'he went to work and I went home'.  ""I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,"" she revealed.  Advert 10  But she had always dreamed of having her own 'big wedding', but was dismayed at the idea it was 'too late' for her.  Her daughter, Donna Pennington, was determined to make her mother's dreams come true.  They set about decorating the community room of O’Bannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, with balloons and her daughter cooked all of the food.  Family, friends, and loved ones turned out to see Fideli in her dream white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt.  Advert 10  She also wore a white veil with an embellished headband.

But, when the sun set on her dream wedding day, she ended up 'really happy' after marrying herself.  Advert 10  In her hand as she said her vows to herself, she held a white lily as a symbol for self-love.  ""I said, 'Everybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they’re happy and everything’s going to be hunky-dory, but they don’t consider the inside, the little petals inside',"" she told Today.  ""The inside is what’s important. That’s where God’s love flows. That’s where he gives you wisdom and he gives you hope. And nobody ever takes time to think about that.""  She added: ""So that’s what I’ve done, and I’d appreciate it if all of you people would do it and think of it that way.""

"wedding","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","{""Minneapolis"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:25:00","Your dress is tailored, your hair and makeup trial is complete, and you’ve also lined up all the vendors, paid the deposits, and sent every invite. With all of the major to-dos checked off your list, you may be wondering what's left to be done. While floral arrangements and seating charts may be top of mind, don’t forget about the reason this all began in the first place: your engagement ring! Prepping your wedding jewelry—your engagement ring and both wedding bands—is an important but often overlooked step in the getting-ready process; just as you were diligent about ensuring that your diamond or colorful gemstone looked its best in your engagement photos, you should extend that same level of care for your jewelry in the days before you say “I do.” “There are likely many wedding guests who will see your rings for the first time on your wedding day so they need to be on point,” shares Sharon Schatner, GIA Diamond Graduate at Filigree Jewelers. “And let’s not forget about your wedding pictures. Your rings will be highlighted in those forever photos so they need to look perfect.”  Meet the Expert Easter Ahn-Lee is a fine jewelry and engagement ring designer, and the founder of the jewelry brand Easter Ahn Design.  Sharon Schatner is a GIA diamond graduate and self-proclaimed ""rock nerd"" at Filigree Jewelers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  That's why it's so important to properly care for your special pieces ahead of the big day. To take the guesswork out of caring for your wedding jewelry—and ensuring they're in the best possible condition on the day you say ""I do""—we created a timeline that outlines exactly what you need to do and when, from the moment you get engaged to the day you tie the knot. Follow the expert advice of Schatner and Easter Ahn-Lee, a fine jewelry and engagement ring designer, and your rings will be ready for their wedding debut.  Photo by Valorie Darling; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  As Soon as Possible: Get Your Ring Resized  Before we dive into the specifics, if your wedding rings don't fit your finger the way you'd like, be sure to have them resized as soon as possible. “I would recommend having your ring resized right away, whether it's too big or small,” says Ahn-Lee. What's more, while weight loss shouldn't be a priority on your to-do list, Ahn-Lee further notes that “for couples who lose weight before the wedding day, I would recommend resizing the wedding bands to fit a few weeks before the wedding day so there isn't a significant change to ring size.”  One Year Out: Establish Your Budget  When establishing a comprehensive wedding budget, make sure you account for your wedding bands—while they're not as pricey of a line item as catering, for example, knowing how much you have to spend allows you to better consider your options. “Your wedding jewelry is usually part of your wedding budget, so it is also helpful to know how much you plan on spending,” explains Ahn-Lee. “You'll also need time to research and plan your [pieces] if you are doing any custom jewelry work.” Start saving photos of ring stacks and individual bands you like in order to share them with your partner and jeweler when shopping.  Planning on wearing earrings, a bracelet, or a necklace alongside your bands? Consider whether you want to purchase those items, or if you’re borrowing them from family members, and include that in your budget. And if those borrowed items need to be cleaned, bring them along on your next trip to the jeweler.  Six Months Out: Take Your Engagement Ring in for a Checkup  About six months before you say ""I do,"" visit your jeweler for a quick ring checkup. This is also a great time to ask questions about how to best care for your rock while at home. “General knowledge on how to care for and protect your jewelry will help maintain its beauty,” says Ahn-Lee. Lastly, while we highly recommend this step ahead of the wedding, you should continue to get your ring examined on a regular basis and add it to your routine for years to come. “A half-yearly to yearly checkup is also recommended to ensure the stones are secure and prongs, links, clasps, and settings are in good condition,"" Ahn-Lee adds.    Photo by Rachel Rodgers Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Three to Four Months Out: Buy Your Wedding Bands  It's generally recommended that you choose your wedding bands at least three to four months before the wedding, and Schatner adds that couples should buy their bands no later than one month before the big day. When selecting your bands, make it a day-long event with your partner and schedule time to grab breakfast or lunch, then head to the jeweler to try on those all-important pieces. As for who picks up the tab for the rings? That all depends! If you want to purchase your partner’s band and they yours, that's great, but it’s certainly not a requirement. “Since wedding bands are generally part of the wedding budget, the couple can discuss how they want to purchase them,” explains Ahn-Lee. “There is no right or wrong way on who should be buying them.”  Finally, once your rings are ready, Schatner advises couples to pick them up together so the jeweler can make sure they're a perfect fit. “If an alteration needs to be made, you can leave it with the jeweler, saving yourself time and an extra trip.”  About a Week Out: Get Your Rings Cleaned  “It’s ideal to get your rings cleaned as close to the day of the wedding as possible, so they are at their sparkling best for your special day,” says Schatner. “Your jeweler is happy to clean your rings for you, and when we clean them we also check for loose stones or lifted prongs.” If you're having them cleaned a week out, you may want to store your jewelry in a ring box rather than wear it; if going a week without your precious rock feels unimaginable, be sure to remove it whenever cooking, cleaning, working out, or applying makeup, sunscreen, or moisturizer, thus ensuring it remains clean and shiny ahead of the wedding. If you're nervous about keeping it pristine, see if your jeweler can send you home with a convenient cleaning pen for on-the-spot touchups or else try to squeeze in a cleaning appointment closer to the wedding date.  Photo by Leah Marie Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Avoid  In the lead-up to your wedding day, it's important to be extra careful with your jewelry, and when in doubt, take it off. “To protect their jewelry and reduce the risk of damage before the wedding day, a couple should avoid impact on hard surfaces, gripping items with force, or applying strong pressure to jewelry or hands when jewelry is worn, such as when working out or performing physical labor,” shares Ahn-Lee. “Avoid harsh chemicals such as chlorine and household bleach and everyday substances such as lotion, hairspray, and perfume.”  If you’re concerned about potentially damaging your band or stone before the big day, consider taking your ring off as soon as you get home. Keep a small dish near the sink so you remember to remove it when washing dishes, and designate a spot in the bathroom and bedroom so your precious jewels are in a secure place when you’re not wearing them.

"wedding","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:00:00","Expand Autoplay Image 1 of 5 Cappella Romana’s “A Ukrainian Wedding” Ukrainian weddings feature decorated tree branches. (Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky/Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky)  The war in Ukraine has made its culture more precious than ever, especially traditions that might become lost after the smoke clears. One of Ukraine’s unique cultural gems involves the music and customs that accompany a traditional wedding. You can hear these evocative songs in “A Ukrainian Wedding,” which will be performed by the women of Cappella Romana with guest Ukrainian singers.  The program is curated by Nadia Tarnawsky, a professional singer and folklorist who gives workshops on Ukrainian music throughout the nation.  “I grew up speaking Ukrainian as a first language,” said Tarnawsky, “My father came to Cleveland, Ohio during World War II, and my mother was born in the U.S. Her family came here from Ukraine in the late Nineteenth Century with the first wave of immigrants.”  HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok  Tarnawsky has a bachelors in music education from Case Western Reserve University, where she has also pursued a masters in ethnomusicology. From 2017 to 2018, she spent 10 months in Ukraine on a Fulbright Scholarship to study its folk music and traditions.  During that time, Tarnawsky traveled with Inna Kovtun, artistic director of the Kyiv-based ensemble Rozhanytsia, to villages where they learned and recorded songs. Since the war started in Ukraine last year, Kovtun has moved to Portland with her daughter. Her husband remains in Ukraine.  “It is important to get these songs,” said Kovtun. “There aren’t that many people who remember all of the verses. Now there are even fewer people because of the war. Nadia and I just listened to them. These are old songs, but I can learn the melody after hearing it one time. The music speaks to my soul.”  Because most of the wedding music is sung by the women of the villages, the concert will feature the women of Cappella Romana plus Tarnawsky, Kovtun, and Hanna Tischenko, who is also a professional folk singer from Ukraine now living as a refugee in Chicago.  The Cappella Romana program draws from wedding folk songs that are not from a particular region of Ukraine, but from all around the country.  “In general, wedding music has specific songs that happen at specific times,” said Tarnawsky. “When the matchmakers come to your house, there’s a song that you sing. When you make the wedding bread called the korovai. It is a yeasty bread, and they did it on ‘The Great British Baking Show.’ You sing about what goes in the bread and how you make it. There are songs about dressing the bride and groom. There is a song about the girl on her last night as an unmarried woman. Songs about making the wreaths that go on their heads. Songs about what to expect when the bride moves into the man’s household, which meant living with the mother-in-law and father-in-law.”  “Weddings are held on Sundays,” added Tarnawsky. “On Mondays the bride’s friends would have farewell breakfast with her and sing these lamentations. There would be songs about how she is not a member of their group anymore. Sometimes she would have to leave the village, and they wouldn’t see her again.”  The second half of the program features music that is usually sung during the wedding ceremony.  “Although the church wedding music is not exactly folk in style,” explained Tarnawsky, “I opted to use compositions from composers who were inspired by folk traditions, along with widely known Kyivan chant versions, and pieces which use the liturgical tones. They will be in a more standard, Slavic style.”  Tarnawsky also mentioned that there are other songs that are sung after the wedding, but those songs won’t be part of the concert.  “Some songs have a lot of double-entendre meanings and are racy,” explained Tarnawsky, “And there are a number of songs that remind me of Appalachian murder ballads. They are kind of dark in a similar way.”  But she did talk about one folk song that is done at every wedding.  “It’s a song about two doves that love each other very much,” said Tarnawsky. “They have a nest on the side of a mountain. An eagle comes in and kills the male dove and scoops up the female. He takes the female home where he has a whole bunch of doves in cages. He gives her plenty of food and water, but she is unhappy. She just wants to weep and return to the mountain to the place where she was with the male dove. He offers her other male doves, but she rejects them, complaining that their down is not right, and they don’t have the right voice when they coo.”  “I thought that it was a depressing song,” continued Tarnawsky, “and I asked why is it sung as part of a wedding. A sweet grandmother replied ‘Look at how true her love is. She will love him forever even when he is no longer there. Why wouldn’t you sing this at a wedding.’”  That song, unfortunately, has even more meaning in light of the current situation in Ukraine.  8 p.m. Saturday, May 20, St. Mary’s Cathedral, 1739 N.W.

Now, the group is preparing for another royal wedding: Crown Prince Hussein’s nuptials to Rajwa Al-Saif, which is expected to take place on June 1, 2023. In the latest update on May 15, 2023, The Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman revealed the expected wedding dress code, and it appears to ditch one key accessory that epitomizes royalty. When a fan asked about the attire for the affair via Twitter, Salman responded, “More like black tie, long dress but no tiaras.” The royal blogger never clarified whether the “no tiara” rule applies to the bride, however.  Handout / Getty Images  The Twitter thread began with Salman confirming that Queen Azizah of Malaysia and her husband, King Abdullah, will attend the crown prince’s wedding. Many other royals around the world will also make an appearance. According to Hello!, the guest list will include Princess Hisakoa and Princess Tsuguko of Japan, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.  On May 14, 2023, the Royal Hashemite Court revealed the official logo for Hussein’s big day, which is an Arabic symbol topped with a crown. “As the date of the wedding of HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif nears, we are pleased to share the official logo to mark the occasion, which is Arabic for ‘we rejoice,’” the court tweeted, along with a clip of the graphic. The post even mentioned a hashtag for the special day, which is #CelebratingAlHussein.  The Royal Hashemite Court first announced the crown prince’s wedding date back in December of 2022, but the entity has kept many of the other details a secret. ""The Royal Hashemite Court is pleased to announce that the wedding of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II and Miss Rajwa Khalid Al Saif will take place on June 1, 2023,” the court released in a statement. “The Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah on this occasion and wishes His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bun Abdullah II and Miss Raja Khalid Al Said a lifetime of happiness #Jordan.”  To share the news, the royal court shared a photo of the couple posing together, with the bride-to-be in a white dress with puff sleeves and the future groom in a dark suit. The day is a special one for the future newlyweds because Hussein’s parents, Queen Rania and King Abdullah II, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary a little over a week later, on June 10, 2023, Tatler reports.  The couple first announced their engagement on August 18, 2022. “We pray that God grants us His blessings,” Hussein wrote on his Instagram account. “Grateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes.” The future king of Jordan also uploaded a snap of himself and his soon-to-be wife, and her diamond ring is on full display in the photo. According to Tatler, Hussein popped the question at Rajwa’s father’s home, and his parents were also present to witness the proposal. Queen Rania commented on the Instagram post, “I didn’t think it was possible to hold so much joy in my heart! Congratulations to my eldest Prince Hussein and his beautiful bride-to-be, Rajwa.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vY3Jvd24tcHJpbmNlLWh1c3NlaW4tcm95YWwtd2VkZGluZy1kcmVzcy1jb2RlLTc0OTkzNjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They were most of a continent away in the Bahamas, thanks to the university’s marine ecology program, studying sea stars. The proposal eight years later happened in an altogether different climate, though: on a mountaintop in Colorado.  The details: “Austin and I care very deeply about the natural world, so it was incredibly important to us that our wedding paid homage to nature,” Laura says. “Before our public ceremony, we hiked the trails on our venue's property—me, barefoot, of course—just the two of us and our photographer. About a half-mile back in the woods is a gorgeous waterfall, where we had a private vow reading ceremony. It was so special and intimate and beautiful.” She describes their wedding as an earthy, wildflower party in the woods. To that end, guests took home wildflower seed packets from American Meadows as their favors.  Of note: All of the key songs of the day were by musicians that the couple had seen live. This included Billy Strings’ “Love Like Me” and Trampled By Turtles’ “Alone” (processional), “See the World” by Caamp (recessional) and “The Mountain Song” by Rayland Baxter (first dance).

Laura Palacios was shooting the couple’s big day and toward the end, the bride and groom wanted to jump into the pool. About five minutes after, Palacios noticed people searching the pool floor.  “I asked, ‘Did you lose something?’ My gut was saying it was the ring,” Palacios tells Newsweek. “The bride, Courtney, put her hand on the side of the pool for me to see. The ring was there. The diamond was gone. She was as calm and happy as she had been all day.”  Despite the bride’s calmness over the situation, wedding guests were frantically searching for the missing gem — that’s when Palacios had her brilliant idea.  “I looked back through images and realized it had gone missing at some point on the dance floor,” says the wedding shooter.  Her ingenuity meant that the group quickly ascertained they were looking in the wrong place, Palacios’s pictures confirmed that the diamond had gone missing long before the couple jumped in the pool.  “I would have jumped in the pool to help them look, but I wanted to be sure we weren’t wasting time looking in the wrong place,” adds Palacios.  The dance floor actually had wooden slats but amazingly the diamond was so big that it had become wedged in a gap.  “It was a miracle,” Palacios adds. She posted another video of the moment the precious jewel was recovered by a staff member who returned it to the grateful bride and groom.  More of Palacios’s work can be viewed on her website, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.

Janet Towers, a resident of Colten Care’s Belmore Lodge in Lymington, is no longer able to travel.  Her greatest wish recently had been to see her son John get married to his partner Sarah-Jane.  The New Forest care home secretly transformed Janet’s room into a beautiful wedding chapel – enabling her to see her son exchange vows with his fiancée.  Janie Wilkins, home manager of Belmore Lodge said: “When we learned that Janet may have to miss the wedding, we knew that simply wouldn’t do.  “So, we told a little fib and asked Janet if we could dress her room for a marketing promotion, to show how we can accommodate special occasions.  “Janet agreed and this gave us the opportunity to transform her room and of course dress her accordingly as the beautiful mother of the groom.  “One significant detail was left out though, and that was that we would be re-creating John’s upcoming wedding.”  Bournemouth Echo: Janet Towers with her son John.

(Image: Deep South Media)  Her room was adorned with flowers and had a wedding arch.  “Just before the ‘photoshoot’ I told Janet we had a surprise and gave her the order of service for John’s wedding,” continued Janie.  “She said, ‘but I can’t go’, and I said, ‘no, so they are coming to you’.  “When John and Sarah-Jane came into the room, with Sarah-Jane’s two sons Joshua and Gabriel, everyone was so overwhelmed and emotional.”  The couple went on to read the same vows they would say in the ceremony and exchanged rings.  Everyone then enjoyed cake and toasted the newlyweds with pink fizz.  An emotional Janet said: “I had no idea this was going to happen, but I can’t thank everyone enough.  “I didn’t think I would be able to be part of John and Sarah-Jane’s wedding, but I was, and I loved every single moment of it. Thank you so much to everyone who made my wish possible.”  Janet’s son John added: “My wife and I are extremely grateful to Janie and all the staff at Belmore Lodge who made our special day so memorable. To have mum at our wedding was truly the icing on the cake.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvdmluZy1zb24tYnJpbmdzLXdlZGRpbmctbXVtcy0wNDAwMDAzOTAuaHRtbNIBVmh0dHBzOi8vdWsuc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL25ld3MvbG92aW5nLXNvbi1icmluZ3Mtd2VkZGluZy1tdW1zLTA0MDAwMDM5MC5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-06","10:00:00","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 13:02:05","Choosing your wedding hairstyle is a task that seems like it should be simple, but most brides-to-be would agree that it can be surprisingly difficult to navigate. After all, this is going to be one of the most photographed days of your entire life, so your final look will be on full display for years to come. In addition to considering which type of hairstyle will best suit your wedding style, location, and dress, you'll also need to think about how you envision yourself as bride: Do you want your hair styled into soft, romantic waves that skim across your back, or do you prefer the look of a polish, elegant updo?  As it turns out, you don't need to choose just one hairstyle for your big day. According to hairstylist Jill Buck, the creative behind Hayley Erbert's two stunning cover story hairstyles, a mid-party swap is not only entirely feasible, but it's actually easy to achieve if your pro has prepped your hair properly. Here, she shares her tips for long-lasting nuptial hairstyles and advice on how to change up your look during the wedding.  For soft waves that last all day, start with the right base.  Buck stresses the importance of ensuring that your hairdresser has enough time to prep your hair; ask how long they'd need in an ideal world and build your morning-of timeline around that. ""For brides, I like to really take time in the prep of the hair. It needs to last all day and often there isn’t time to reset any curls on such a busy day,"" she says. ""I start on wet hair with Joico’s K-Pak Luster Lock Spray (for heat protection) and then Joi Whip Design Foam (for structure and hold)."" Then, she gives the hair a ""nice, full blowout"" and curls the entire head using a 1 1/4"" curling iron (Buck likes the T3 Micro). ""Using the bigger iron helps the waves to be a little softer than a traditional Hollywood glam look,"" she explains.  Hayley's soft waves require two additional steps: For that soft, touchable look, Buck says she finishes the curls with a Mason Pierson boar bristle brush and locks the shape in place with Joico’s JoiMist hairspray.    Be sure to choose your most flattering side for a part.  If there's one piece of advice Buck wants to give all brides-to-be, it's that you should over-communicate your preferred ""side"" so that your stylist can part your hair accordingly. ""There is nothing more frustrating than setting a look only to find you have to switch the part!"" she says. Plus, you wouldn't want to end up with a hairstyle that doesn't feel like ""you,"" and parting your hair in a way you've never done before almost always ends in that result.  And don't forget to consider what best suits your wedding dress.  Another pro tip from Buck? During your hair trial, be sure to show your hairstylist a photo of your wedding dress. ""The dress neckline is always my starting point, too,"" she explains. ""You don’t want the hair and dress in competition; they should complement one another.""  If the hair was properly set, changing to an updo should be a breeze.  The beauty of Buck's method? Taking the hair from soft, flowing waves into a structured updo is an extremely straightforward process. ""After my initial set the hair is in perfect condition to put into an updo. I don’t like to use an iron after hairspray so your brush is going to be the best tool for changing the shape,"" she explains. How did she bring Hayley's look up in a flash? ""On a sleek center part I brushed her hair into two ponytails one on top of the other. This helps give me control of how sleek I can get it as well as a good anchor to set the updo and place the Bobby pins. Mini rubber bands, different Bobby pin sizes, and firm hairspray are all good tools to have.""  And if you want to go the other direction? Just be clear about your plans during your first hair trial. It's certainly not impossible to go from an updo to a long, loose hairstyle, but you'll likely need to do some touchups once pins and rubber bands come out, and your stylist may want to use a softer, more flexible hairspray on your initial updo than they otherwise would.  Decide if going from hair down to an updo—or vice versa—makes the most sense for your day.  According to Buck, brides tend to choose updos for more formal events or for the more traditional portion of the day, so most women prefer to star with their hair up and then bring it down. That being said, there's a real benefit to going in the other direction: By the time the party starts and you're ready to dance, having your hair up and out of your face might be exactly what you want. You'll have taken your beautiful portraits with long, flowing hair, and now you can stay cool and look fresh throughout the party.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vaG93LXJlY3JlYXRlLWhheWxleS1lcmJlcnQtY292ZXItaGFpci03MjU1NjM50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But now one of those moments is seeing the light of day, with EW exclusively revealing TK (Ronen Rubinstein) and Carlos (Rafael Silva) cutting their wedding cake.  ""I want a divorce!""

But despite all the sorrow throughout the finale, Silva says filming the wedding ""felt like bliss, it felt like joy, and it felt like love. Everyone was in happy mode.

Rebecca Nguyen Sanchez/Facebook  Rebecca Nguyen was wearing a beautiful classic lace gown adorned with beading and spaghetti straps when she married the love of her life in August 2017. In the years since, the dress has acted as a reminder of the magical day.  ""When I wore it, I felt like me,"" Nguyen said. ""I want to say I felt like this movie star. I felt like this princess, but that wasn't me. I felt like me.""  The memories of that dream quickly turned into a nightmare on Tuesday, when she received the shock of her life, learning that her dress was suddenly missing.  ""My wedding dress was accidentally donated by one of my family members. It was a complete accident, it was during a rush of a lot of things,"" she said while speaking with KCAL News on Wednesday. ""Mistakes happen. When I found out yesterday I was pretty heartbroken.""  Nguyen says that the dress wasn't the only wedding souvenir that got donated to a Goodwill in Brea more than two weeks ago, and she immediately submitted an accidental donation form in hopes of retrieving what she could.  She's visited Goodwill's Orange County headquarters, hoping that some of the employees could help her recover the lost items.  ""It could be sitting at the warehouse, still waiting to get sorted through,"" said Chris Sewitsky, the retail director at the location. ""It just depends where and what time of day it came in. That store is a very busy store. Some stuff does stay at that store, some stuff comes back to main distribution. So, we're hoping we can find it because it is such a unique item.""  On top of her local search, Nguyen has also posted on several local Facebook pages offering to buy back the dress if it's already been purchased.  ""If you have it, please consider selling it back to me. I will pay more than you paid for it. You can even wear it for your wedding! I don't mind sharing the joy and beauty of the dress,"" one post says.  If someone does have it, she's hopeful that they're able to get as much enjoyment out of their special day as she did.  ""Not everybody can afford to get a brand new dress and that's okay. I want someone to be able to enjoy it as well,"" Nguyen said.  Anyone with more information on the missing dress can reach out to Goodwill in Brea, which is located at 634 S. Brea Boulevard, by calling (714) 255-1099.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9sb3NhbmdlbGVzL25ld3Mvb2Mtd29tYW4tZGVzcGVyYXRlbHktc2VhcmNoaW5nLWZvci13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzLXRoYXQtd2FzLWFjY2lkZW50YWxseS1kb25hdGVkLXRvLWdvb2R3aWxsL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbG9zYW5nZWxlcy9uZXdzL29jLXdvbWFuLWRlc3BlcmF0ZWx5LXNlYXJjaGluZy1mb3Itd2VkZGluZy1kcmVzcy10aGF0LXdhcy1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktZG9uYXRlZC10by1nb29kd2lsbC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The best way to organize a timeless event is to host classic affair with plenty of design details that have already proven they can stand the test of time. ""Picking wedding décor and fashion can be daunting, especially if you want your wedding to feel timeless,"" shares wedding planner Dani Blasena of HauteFêtes. ""While Instagram and Pinterest are wonderful for inspiration, they often promote the same trending ideas over and over again. In contrast, a timeless wedding is one that stands the test of time and style!"" So, if you want to plan a timeless ceremony and reception, it's best to choose color palettes, fashion, and décor that will still feel relevant in 20 years.  It's important to remember that timeless weddings can take many forms, so don't shy away from the style out of fear of planning a cookie cutter celebration. You can still infuse the day with plenty of personality. ""For me, what makes a wedding timeless is not about following the most current wedding trends or guidelines but about creating a celebration that genuinely reflects a couple's unique love story and values,"" notes wedding photographer Jenny Fu. ""It's about making an impact that lasts long after the day.""  Meet the Expert Dani Blasena is the owner, creative director and lead designer of HauteFêtes.  Jenny Fu is a New York-based wedding photographer.  Jacqueline Hallgarth is the founder of wedding and event planning company Jacqueline Hallgarth Events.  If you're hoping to plan a timeless wedding that feels right for you and your spouse-to-be, we asked wedding pros to share their favorite details. Ahead, 20 ideas you can make your own.  Photo by KT Merry; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose a Classic Destination  “Venue selection is one of the most important aspects of creating a timeless wedding,” shares planner Jacqueline Hallgarth. If you know you want to tie the knot far from home, consider a locale that's steeped in history. “You and your guests will be linked forever through this selection, so choose carefully,"" she adds. ""A destination wedding, held in historic villa in Italy or chateau in France, will not only be beautiful on your wedding day, but will also create timeless memories shared by you and all your guests. Regardless of the specific venue, beautiful memories can be created anywhere with the right elements.”  Photo by Caroline Tran; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Pick an Estate-Style Venue  Modern art galleries and open warehouses are incredible blank slates, but they're not the best choices for timeless celebrations. “Choosing an estate-style venue that is classic in architecture and will create a backdrop for your big day that is as relevant in 20 years’ time as it is today,” advises Blasena. “My favorites include Rosewood Miramar Beach for a classic Hamptons style on the West Coast replete with boxwoods and white siding. Abroad, the Belmond San Michele with views for days, classic Italian-style spaces and gardens that are breathtaking. Both venues have everything you need to make your big day truly timeless from start to finish.”  Photo by Will Reid Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Black-Tie Dress Code  What your guests wear will have an impact on the overall feel of your celebration, so picking the right attire style is important. “By requesting black-tie and formal attire, you automatically create an elevated style that translates into forever cherished photographs,” shares Hallgarth. ""Floor-length gowns and black tuxedos never go out of fashion and when captured together, creates that timeless look everyone wants from their wedding.”  Photo by Volvoreta; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose Greenery and White Florals  When picking out your floral design, you can never go wrong with classic white blooms and lots of lush greenery. Blasena says, “Green and white flowers are both classic and neutral and will never overwhelm a design.”  Photo by Stephanie Sunderland; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace a Soft Color Palette  Punchy colors might be trending, but are you sure you'll love Barbie pink or neon green for years to come? If the answer isn't a resounding ""yes!"" it's likely not the best choice. “A soft color palette is always a good rule of thumb,"" notes Blasena. ""Something like a French blue or classic taupe is always sophisticated and elegant. Pick two to three soft colors that suit your style best and keep it simple.”  Photo by Ryan Ray; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire the Right Wedding Photographer  You could plan a big day that's entirely timeless, but if you hire a photographer with a trendy, of-the-moment aesthetic, your photos might not stand the test of time. ""To truly capture the timeless essence of a wedding, it's crucial to work with an experienced photographer who can document your day,” shares Fu. “The photographs they capture will be a lasting reminder of the love and joy you shared on your wedding day.” Blasena adds, “A photographer with a classic editing style, natural color tones, and graceful composition will create photographs never go out of style.”  Photo by Lev Kuperman; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  And Don't Shy Away from Candid Photos  While traditional wedding portraits are essential, some couples avoid candids out of fear of looking too modern. Whatever you do, get this idea out of your head. ""Candid wedding photographs have the power to capture the true essence and emotion of your wedding day,"" says Fu. ""Let the genuine connections and meaningful moments shine–these moments are timeless because you've lived the experience, and the candid photographs can take you back long after the day has passed.""  Photo by Henry + Mac; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Wear Classic Wedding Attire  Fashion trends come and go, even in the world of weddings. “One of the most important elements of your wedding is your dress,” says Blasena. “It’s easy to get caught up in all the amazing wedding fashion there is today with designers from all over the world. To avoid looking back in horror, think timeless and classic in the cut; a soft ivory versus a stark white; and, avoid overcomplicating the style with unnecessary embellishments such as beading, tulle, or lace. Remember, less is always more!”  Photo by Lisa Poggi; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have Musicians at Your Ceremony  Acoustic versions of your favorite romantic songs can bring an emotional elegance and set the proper tone for your wedding ceremony. Consider hiring a string trio or a classical guitarist to play as you walk down the aisle.

Used as vessels for your florals or in your dinnerware, it adds a traditional and elegant touch to the space.

Serve your favorite bubbly in coupes, stacked in a tower, to make for an extra celebratory (and photo-worthy) moment at your reception.

It sets the tone for the reception and brings a retro elegance as you get down with your new spouse and guests.  Photo by Corbin Gurkin; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace Candlelight  “Whether it’s dinner for two or a wedding for 250, candlelight creates an intimate atmosphere which can transform any space,” shares Blasena. “There’s nothing more magical than a candlelit room to create romance. Adding clusters of pillar and votive candles or simple white taper candles to your tabletop is an inexpensive touch that will also never go out of style.”  Photo by Anée Atelier; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Opt for Black-and-White Photos  Don’t forget to ask your photographer to edit some shots without color. “Black and white photography is classic, timeless, and elegant. It creates a sophisticated look that will never go out of style,” says Fu.  Photo by Jenny Fu; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Consider Seasonal Shades  “Featuring seasonal colors in the floral, stationery, tabletop and event design creates an event that resonates with guests emotions and ties your wedding to a place in time,” shares Hallgarth. ""I always encourage bright and colorful blooms for a spring wedding and autumnal florals and foliage for a fall wedding which captures not only the beauty of the moment, but forever marries the event to a specific feeling of the year.”  Photo by Brooke Miller Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Getaway Car  After you say “I do,” there’s nothing more timeless than speeding off into the sunset with your new spouse. Find a vintage car and adorn it with florals for a charming getaway for the newlyweds as they head to the reception.  Photo by Sasithon Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Make a Grand Entrance  As the wedding reception begins, have a special moment where the emcee announces the bride and groom for the first time as they rush out onto the dance floor. The entrance is a fun and celebratory moment that can easily transition to the first dance, and it's something that's been done at weddings for decades.  Photo by Allan Zepeda Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire a Live Band  While choosing a DJ or band for your wedding is a personal decision for a couple, there's no denying that live musicians can be an absolutely classic addition to your celebration. Make sure to do research to have your band fit the style and song selection you want for the evening.  Photo By Tailor James; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Leave With a Sparkler Exit  At the end of the evening (or before you head to the after party), have your guests line up for a sparkler send-off. It's a beautiful end to celebrations around those you love.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vdGltZWxlc3Mtd2VkZGluZy1pZGVhcy03MjU1NjU20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The response was generally positive, with many applauding the idea and saying they wished they had thought of it themselves.  She also received curious questions and some criticism about whether it imposed extra work on her wedding staff, which prompted her to make a follow-up video saying that she tipped all service workers involved. Despite her attempted clarification, some viewers were unconvinced and alleged that she deleted a previous comment saying she hadn't tipped them.  Still, the apparent hack has inspired others to think more creatively about wedding food — so as long as restaurant and ceremony workers are properly compensated.  Mulkey did not immediately respond to multiple requests from Insider for comment.  Madison Mulkey, a photographer with over 28,000 TikTok followers, posted a video on Sunday explaining why she chose the restaurant chain Chili's for her wedding food.  She said the main attraction was the low cost — $1,950 for 99 guests. The food included chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, and salad. According to The Knot, the average price for traditional wedding catering can cost $75 a guest, which for Mulkey, amounted to nearly $7,500 total.  She said there were some unexpected complications that arose because they didn't want to pay the delivery fee — which would have been $300, she said in a comment. They threw their wedding on St. Patrick's Day weekend, and the restaurant was packed, so they had to pick up the food early at 11 a.m. and keep it cool before the service which was at 6 p.m.  Normally, Chili's workers would deliver and set it up, Mulkey said. But since they picked the food up directly from the restaurant, her hired servers — who were mostly hired for cleaning, she said — were forced to do a lot of the food preparations. She added that her coordinator helped them.  ""Everyone made it work, thank goodness,"" Mulkey said in the clip, which has been viewed over 1.3 million times. ""Our situation was rare. I'm sure if you order from Chili's in any other regard they would serve it and it would all be so hassle-free.""  The reaction was mostly positive, with people saying they would be excited to find out a wedding they attended was serving Chili's, and that society should normalize scaled-down weddings like this.  ""I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was chili's,"" a top comment with over 7,000 likes said. ""This is my dream,"" someone else wrote.  The official Chili's Grill & Bar TikTok account even left a comment calling the video ""iconic.""  However, some people worried that Mulkey's wedding staffers were forced to take on more work.  ""I'm all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,"" one top comment with over 1,600 likes said. ""You should have paid for delivery.""  A comment with over 2,200 likes said they'd give the poster an ""A for creativity"" but critiqued that the food was 7 hours old, which probably stressed the staff out.  The concerns for her staff prompted Mulkey to make a follow-up video. She assured viewers that she tipped the Chili's kitchen staff $300, and tipped the coordinator and the servers on top of their hourly payment.  ""All they did was make the food, help the buffet run efficiently, and then clean up,"" Mulkey said of the servers. ""I didn't ask anyone to work outside of their bounds or their means.""  Viewers, however, did not seem entirely convinced. Several comments on the follow-up video accused her of deleting a comment from her original viral video where they said she told another user she hadn't tipped anyone extra since it was included in their original payment (Insider was unable to find and verify the original comment).  Someone also claimed that Chili's managers aren't able to receive tips which prompted them to ask how she was able to tip them. (Insider could not independently verify this but has reached out to the company for comment.)  ""Maybe they didn't take it, I have no idea what they did with it,"" Mulkey wrote in response.

"wedding","2023-10-01","14:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 04:31:00","If you're running out of unique venues or destinations to have your wedding, look no further. Weddings in space are now a thing and we heard it is truly out of this world.  If the thought of nuptials on Earth sound common and boring, a space travel company wants to give you the chance to get hitched at a venue looking down on the third rock from the sun instead.  The company, called Space Perspective, is offering couples a memorable way to say “I do” — putting the bride and groom into orbit using a carbon-neutral balloon with giant windows to make the most of the ultimate view of planet Earth.  According to Jane Poynter, the co-founder of Space Perspective, the waiting list to get married amongst the stars is already light-years long.  “We’ve already had people wanting to be the first marriage in space, so we’ll see who is the first,” Poynter told The Cool Down.  “Unlike all other spacecraft whereby the crewed compartment separates from one flight system mid-flight and transfers to another flight system, Spaceship Neptune’s capsule remains secured to the SpaceBalloon the entire flight from liftoff to splashdown, creating a seamlessly safe and gentle flight,” she explained.  The website said the technology the spacecraft uses has already been “proven,” as it has been used for decades by NASA teams and other government agencies to “lift research telescopes and other heavy, sensitive instruments.”  Space Perspective was founded by two former crew members of Biosphere 2, an Earth system science research facility located in Arizona, which was originally constructed to explore the potential of closed ecological systems in supporting human life during outer-space missions.  Vincent Bachet, Space Perspective lead and development engineer, added that Neptune’s windows are going to be “the biggest windows flown into space.”  Using hyper-resistant materials and a special anti-UV coating, Space Perspective co-founder and co-CEO Taber MacCallum called them “the quintessential part of the experience.”  Couples who are interesting in the unique wedding experience can join the waitlist on Space Perspective’s website for late 2024.

"wedding","2008-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:30:00","If you asked Carolina Favero Braga if she would end up with Freud Milice as she began her emergency room rotation in 2015, her answer would likely be a resounding no. The twosome worked alongside each other for two weeks at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn when she was a medical school student and he was a resident. As Carolina puts it, their courtship wasn’t exactly love at first sight. “I was skeptical of his big personality and braggadocios behavior,” Carolina admits. “On our first few days working together, he told me he loved house parties, red wine, and older women. Eye roll.”  But, in a plot twist of romantic comedy proportions, Freud managed to get Carolina’s number and would text her after every shift—and even when she traveled to Florida. “On the day I was returning to New York, he knew I was anxious about flying, and sent me Angus and Julia Stone’s ‘Big Jet Plane’ single to keep me calm throughout the flight. When I landed at JFK, he surprised me and was waiting at baggage claim. Five days later, we went on our first official date. As they say, the rest is history.”  Fast-forward to June 5, 2020, when the couple was taking a socially distanced trip to the Catskills. As physicians, both Carolina and Freud were on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic and took a well-deserved vacation once restrictions began to loosen. “When we arrived, the hotel staff recommended a walk in the garden prior to dinner,” she shares. “We got ready and while walking the garden, Freud got down on one knee. I am sure he had more to say but all I remember is, ‘Will you marry me?’” The answer? A resounding yes.  When it came to planning their September 3, 2022, wedding, the couple wanted their special day to highlight the bride’s Brazilian background and the groom’s Haitian roots. They enlisted wedding planner Nathalie Cadet-James of Luxe Fete, who had the perfect spot in mind: Itapororoca Villa in Trancoso, Brazil. “There is the essence of West Africa in this rustic Brazilian beach town,” the bride explains. “With its scenic backdrops and rich culture, we knew this was the perfect place to share our love story with family and friends.”  With 80 of their closest friends and family members in attendance, their destination was a beautiful representation of Carolina and Freud in every way imaginable. “As an interracial couple, it was important for us to highlight our different backgrounds,” the bride shares. “Nathalie is Haitian-American, and she really understood who we were as individuals, but also as a couple. Her excitement to celebrate our love story was noticeable from before we even officially hired her.” Read on for an intimate look at Carolina and Freud’s wedding festivities, as photographed by Heather Waraksa.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina and Freud didn’t have to look too far for wedding inspiration. Elements of Trancoso’s seaside beauty were woven throughout the weekend. From watercolor illustrations to magenta accents that pay tribute to the local bougainvillea flowers, the invitation suite from LetterHeads Miami gave guests the perfect glimpse of what was to come.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The couple kicked off the festivities with a beach party the night before the wedding. Carolina stunned in a white dress from Farm Rio, while Freud looked effortlessly elegant in a white button-down from Peter Millar and matching shorts.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our wedding [weekend] didn’t have a traditional timeline,” the bride shares. “We had our maid of honor and best man make their speeches during the welcome party so they could enjoy themselves. We know the effort it took for our guests to celebrate with us and we wanted them to enjoy themselves to the fullest.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  I don’t know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Come the wedding day, the bride wore a strapless gown from Valentini Spose, which beautifully fulfilled her “clean and timeless vision.” She shares, “I truly believed that this was my day and wanted to wear something that made me feel spectacular. I was also three months postpartum when I started shopping for a wedding dress, so it was important for me to feel confident in it."" Carolina adds, ""I don’t know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  When it came to accessorizing her gown, Carolina knew she wanted to support women-owned businesses. She opted for a veil by Jennifer Leigh Couture Veils, Julia Vaughn jewelry, and a special pair of shoes from Brother Vellies. “During the beginning of the pandemic, I followed [Brother Vellies founder] Aurora James on Instagram,” Carolina explains. “It had to be fate that [she] designed a bridal shoe line for HBO’s Insecure. I texted Nathalie and the team and said, ‘I know I don’t have a dress yet, but I know this is the shoe.’ So, I actually bought my bridal shoes before I had a dress!”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Meanwhile, the groom suited up in a custom navy tuxedo from Suitsupply. Rounding out the look was a tie from Tom Ford, Hermès shoes, and his everyday accessories. “Freud wore his watch and a bracelet which was engraved with his daughter’s name,” Carolina adds.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Prior to the ceremony, the couple had an “intimate and emotional” first look. “We wanted to have a moment between us before sharing ‘us’ with everyone else,” the groom explains.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Upon arrival, guests could grab some water, local juices, or a monogrammed coconut as they listened to a soothing setlist from the string quartet group Quarteto De Cordas de Trancoso.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our ceremony was on the beach underneath coconut trees with a wooden altar decorated with bougainvillea,” the bride shares. “It was very simple, but elegant at the same time.” The view of the ocean was a welcomed bonus.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina glided down the aisle to Felix Mendelssohn’s “Marcha Nupcial,” with her father and a bouquet of local flowers in tow.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Freud spent months writing his vows during his night shifts, promising to “be present, to be here next week, next month, next year, and the year after that.” Meanwhile, Carolina performed a song she often sings to their daughter at night. Her favorite lyrics: “I love you in the morning, and in the afternoon. I love you in the evening, and underneath the moon.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The newlyweds slipped on their wedding bands from Boccardo Jewelers, shared a kiss, and recessed down the aisle to Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Make time to enjoy special moments with each other. It goes by so fast!  Photo by Heather Waraksa  After the ceremony, Carolina and Freud snuck away to take some pictures with photographer Heather Waraksa. “​​Make time to enjoy special moments with each other,” the couple recommends. “It goes by so fast!”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our reception decor is what [our florist] Katia Criscuolo calls 'brasilidade sofisticada'—or 'sophisticated Brazilianness,'” Carolina shares. “She incorporated local materials and tones in the lighting, linens, and place setting. There was one long table in the reception area with no assigned seating, which was to be decorated with magenta flowers among greenery.” The bride’s favorite area was the dessert room—a bougainvillea-adorned space that displayed “hundreds of sweets” on floating trays.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  If guests were craving fresh air, they could hang out in one of the venue’s chill outdoor seating areas.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  True to their love story, Carolina and Freud shared a sweet first dance to Angus and Julia Stone’s “Big Jet Plane.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  While the newlyweds opted for a buffet style of local Bahian-inspired food—courtesy of O Cacau—they tapped Confet Doceria to whip up a four-tiered cake. “We had two different flavors. One layer was white cake with brigadeiro filling, [which is a traditional Brazilian dessert],” the bride explains. “The other layers were white cake with dulce de leche filling.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Since Carolina and Freud love music—they have a shared fondness of hip-hop—they wanted to find a DJ who understood their taste. “We worked closely with our DJ, Nath Carreiro, to play music that played significant parts in our lives both as individuals and as a couple,” the groom notes. ""We shared with her Spotify playlists for both the welcome party and the wedding. DJ Nath was a smashing success!"" In fact, the newlyweds even infiltrated the DJ booth during the evening with their daughter, Celine.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “We were on the dance floor for most of the wedding,” Freud explains. But, according to the couple, guests left the event with more than some new dance moves. “Because many of our friends had never been to Brazil before, we focused a high level of detail on the experience that our guests would have,” Carolina shares. “Freud created a WhatsApp group with all the guests as a way for everyone to connect a few weeks prior to the wedding. Our guests were able to get to know each other and it made it even more special on the wedding day. The group is still going strong to this day!” Whether it’s an inner circle or excellent vendors, no love story is complete without the people cheering you on along the way.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYm91Z2FpbnZpbGxlYS1icmF6aWxpYW4td2VkZGluZy03NDk4Nzgz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They reportedly expected 160 guests from across the country to attend their June 24 wedding.  The couple says their plans were turned upside down when they learned their hotel block had been cancelled to make room for migrants that were being sent upstate by New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The Crossroads Hotel was tapped to accept migrants who were being bused from New York City to hotels in Westchester and the Hudson Valley.  ""We woke up the other morning and got a phone call from my sister...to check out the news,"" Moretti told "" Jesse Watters Primetime "" on Tuesday. ""No phone call, no text message, no email from them about any cancellations. I call them up and ... I asked them about the migrants going in there, is it going to be safe for my guests and ourselves to be there.

""It's a very eye-opening experience, and when you start to add everything up, it's pretty wild,"" Hough said.  As the pieces for their ceremony and reception come together, the couple revealed that they have already chosen a venue, and that fireworks and a first dance — naturally — are in the cards.  For the choreographer and actor, and his dancer bride-to-be, the wedding isn't so much about ""perfection"" as it is about a ""vibe,"" which is important when it comes to the guest list.  ""A rule that we've set is that we don't want to catch up with people on the day of the wedding,"" Erbert said. ""We're inviting people that maybe we haven't seen in a while, but every time we get together with them, it's like we pick up right where we left off, or they're people that have been consistently in our lives throughout the years.

He added, ""We want the entire day to be a blast.""  And as for that first dance, Erbert revealed that it will be a special moment, even if Hough wasn't so interested in the wedding tradition at first.

The suit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Common Pleas by Aric Hutchinson and two other people hurt in the crash, names more than a half dozen defendants including Jamie Lee Komoroski, who police arrested in connection to the April 28th death of Samantha Miller 34.  Miller, from Charlotte, North Carolina, was killed in the Folly Beach crash in Charleston County.  Three other of Miller's family members, including Hutchinson, suffered major injuries in the two-vehicle late evening crash.  The lawsuit also names five local businesses as defendants and claims Komoroski, 25, had been ""bar hopping"" the day of the wreck, which according to an arrest affidavit, involved a rented Toyota Camry slamming into the golf cart.  In addition to wrongful death, the 28-page suit also accuses the defendants of gross negligence, reckless hiring, supervision and training as well as ""negligent infliction of emotional distress.""  'Noticeably and visibly intoxicated'  A responding Folly Beach police officer, who found the victims on the ground at the scene, said the driver of the Camry smelled strongly of alcohol and admitted to drinking ""one beer and a drink with tequila about an hour ago.""  “Despite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments,” the lawsuit reads, “Jaime Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.”  Former Raider enters plea in DUI caseEx-Raider Henry Ruggs pleads guilty to driving drunk at 156 mph, causing fatal crash  ""This case is about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly,"" the family's Charleston-based attorney Danny Dalton said.  The plaintiffs ask for a jury trial and seek punitive damages among other costs in connection to the case.  Just married  Earlier this month, Folly Beach Public Safety Department Chief Andrew Gilreath told USA TODAY Hutchinson and Miller were married just hours before the 10:15 p.m. wreck.  Police said data retrieved from Komoroski’s rental car show she was driving 65 mph and briefly hit the brakes before she slammed into the golf cart.

"wedding","2019-07-01","14:00:00","{""WestHartford"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:00:00","Getting engaged, planning a wedding, and preparing for life with your favorite person is one of the most exciting and joyful times of your life, but it can also be rife with familial conflicts, disagreements over the budget, and the need for a lot of compromises. Still, every challenge you face while planning your wedding is an opportunity to improve your relationship, strengthen your bond, and deepen your communication skills as a couple.  “Defining your shared values, navigating conflict, getting on the same page in terms of finances, deciding how we spend time in relationships outside of our primary relationships—any number of topics that come up during wedding planning need to get negotiated on an ongoing basis,” says Jennifer Uhrlass, licensed marriage and family therapist at Modern MFT in New York City. “It has to be an ongoing, open dialogue, which is really training for the ongoing negotiations that are going that are going to take place along the course of the relationship.”  Meet the Expert Jennifer Uhrlass is a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) at Modern MFT in New York City.  Ahead, Uhrlass speaks to us about how this crucial window of time—the engagement period—can be an opportunity for couples to strengthen their relationship and build new skills as partners.  Communicate and Compromise  Every aspect of your wedding is about the two of you as a couple, which means you’ll both need to compromise to create a day that speaks to two different personalities. Sometimes it’s easy: Maybe one partner doesn’t care about the signature cocktails or the other partner doesn’t have a preference for the reception exit. But when only one partner is set on a destination wedding, or wants a religious ceremony, or won’t trim the guest list, the middle ground can be much harder to find.  The key, says Uhrlass, is making sure you take the time to fully listen to and process your partner’s wishes—and express your own—so that you can come to an agreement you are both on board with. “Do you truly, truly hear and understand the other person’s perspective, or are you just glossing over stuff and moving forward without understanding?” she says. “There are times when you can miss each other’s message—the message sent is not always the message received. Recognize the importance of slowing down the interaction, making sure you heard and understood what your partner said, and making sure that you can come to a mutual understanding.”  Get Into an Argument—or Several  Arguments about the details of your wedding—whether it’s your partner’s desire to torpedo the guest list by adding three tables of fraternity brothers or your own insistence on a specific type of music—are precursors to future conflicts in your life together. How you approach and solve these conflicts helps you lay the foundation for healthy and productive disagreements in the future. “Learning how to navigate conflict effectively with your partner is essential,” says Uhrlass. “You have to be able to do that well with each other because the problems are going to be perpetual. There's always going to be a need to navigate and negotiate ongoing issues throughout the course of the relationship.” Today it’s the guest list and cake flavors; tomorrow it may be where to send your kids to school or how to spend your year-end bonus. “Often, partners tend to get caught up in the content of a disagreement, when it can be much more productive to focus on their process of engagement when it comes to a particular conflict,” says Uhrlass. “What’s important is to learn how to navigate that conflict effectively; not so much trying to avoid conflict altogether, but to recognize that conflict is a healthy part of a relationship.”  Photo by Getty Images; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Family Boundaries  Weddings can bring out the best in your family, but there's no denying that they can also bring out the worst. Explaining to your parents that you won’t be tying the knot at your childhood church, telling your mother-in-law her entire bridge club didn’t make the guest list, breaking the news to your siblings that their toddlers won’t be invited to the reception: These family conflicts (and many others) have the potential to put you and your partner on opposite teams. As you prepare for your wedding, it's important to remember that you’re also developing a new team of your own. “One of the natural challenges around the topic of getting married is that there’s a shift: You were part of one family unit and now you’re cultivating a new family unit in your relationship with your partner,” says Uhrlass. “Moving through this identity shift can bring up a lot of conflicts and a lot of emotion.”  Use this time to set collective boundaries as a couple, understand each other’s family history, and prioritize your partnership. “It is possible to work through this through dialogue and understanding each person’s perspective,” says Urhlass. “’Your mom wants this, however, for us, we’re also weighing this and this,’—you want to make sure that you get on the same page so you can make decisions together as a unit.”  Talk About Money  How you choose to finance your wedding is a microcosm of the larger financial decisions you’ll make in the future: How you put together a budget, and whether you’ll stick to it; whether you’re willing to take on credit card debt or loans, or accept money from either set of parents; whether your individual incomes and spending patterns are causing unseen conflict. Deciding whether you want to splurge on a band or spend less on a DJ is a precursor to future conversations about which house is in your budget, whether you’ll put a vacation on your credit card, and how often you need to upgrade your television. “Navigating issues related to finances is a common point of contention,” says Urhlass. “It could bring up difficult emotions such as fear or feelings of inadequacy. There may also be significant power differentials; in a relationship where there's a disparity in income, it can negatively impact a couple's ability to address issues in a productive way. If partners haven't reached a place where they feel comfortable, there can be a lot to unpack there. If you're just leaving it festering in the background, and you're not really addressing it, then they will tend to get worse, or stay unaddressed, which can lead to contempt later on.”  Give Each Other Space to Destress  Every major life change brings a heightened period of stress, and you and your partner will need to know how to take care of yourselves—and each other—to get through them. “Learning to take care of yourself through the very difficult wedding planning process is, I think, an essential element to navigating life effectively,” says Uhrlass. “If we're stressed to the max and we're not taking care of ourselves, we're not working out, we're not getting our proper sleep, we're not getting nutrition, or we're not spending time with friends, it’s going to have a major impact on how we approach topics and conflict and disagreements. It's really important to step back and stick to routines that are helpful to manage the stress effectively.”  This could mean planning your meal tasting around your partner’s weekly round of golf, making sure you have enough money set aside for weekend excursions (instead of putting all travel on hold until your honeymoon), or maintaining your Friday date night—no wedding talk allowed. “Set aside time to have space with each other,” says Uhrlass. “Spend time with each other nurturing your relationship, as opposed to talking about the to-do list for the wedding.  Define Your Shared Values  A shared vision for your big day can also help you define the elements that will become your family’s values moving forward: How closely will you follow religious traditions? How often will you see your parents and siblings? What constitutes a worthwhile financial investment? How do you, as a couple and as individuals, define and deepen your relationships with your friends? “Two people can have very different beliefs and philosophies about money, or [anything] across the board,” says Urhlass. “That doesn't necessarily mean that they're incompatible. It just might mean that there's more to talk about, that they understand each other and make sure that they can be on the same page in terms of their long-term goals, their values, and how they want to move forward in their lives developing a sense of identity as a couple.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vaG93LXdlZGRpbmctcGxhbm5pbmctc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLTcyNTU2NTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Police said the woman, Premalatha, 35, was found bludgeoned to death with a rod. Reportedly, the incident took place after midnight, when the couple returned from the woman’s house in Thumkunta after their wedding anniversary celebrations. Their two children, who are in high school, were at the grandmother’s house in Thumkunta for the ongoing summer vacation.  It is suspected that Janardhan and Premalatha were engaged in a heated argument, which turned violent.  According to the police, Janardhan, an alcoholic, had left the family last year.

Talking about Sidharth and Kiara, Ranbir said, “They are quite beautiful.” Also read: AI reimagines Bollywood stars as old men but internet isn't impressed: ‘Hrithik Roshan looks like Ranbir Kapoor’ Ranbir Kapoor recreated Sidharth Malhotra's wedding moment in an interview.

He got up, held the hand of the host and said, “We can walk around this thing like we are getting married or something.” But the host intervened, saying, “Guys, I am already married.” To this, Ranbir replied, “Yeah, me too"" and both of them took their seats again.

"wedding","2023-07-01","14:00:00","{""Uk"", ""Irkutsk"", ""Russia""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:36:36","Weddings are supposed to be joyful, but this joy can be accompanied by a lot of stress. Alongside choosing the menu, flowers and decorations and sorting the table plan, body image – how we think and feel about the way we look – can cause worries, too.  We could not identify any previous research that had formally looked at how brides in the UK felt about their body image. To address this, and fill the gap in our knowledge, our research explored how brides felt about their body image in the run-up to their wedding. We focused in particular on any appearance concerns that they had and how these made them feel – from the planning stage right up to the big day itself.  One hundred and thirty-four women took part in either an interview or an online survey. They were a mix of women planning their weddings and those who had been married in the past three years. Many women experienced feelings of pressure and expectation to look a certain way on their wedding day.  This article is part of Quarter Life, a series about issues affecting those of us in our twenties and thirties. From the challenges of beginning a career and taking care of our mental health, to the excitement of starting a family, adopting a pet or just making friends as an adult. The articles in this series explore the questions and bring answers as we navigate this turbulent period of life.  You may be interested in:  Love Island ditches fast fashion: how reality celebrities influence young shoppers’ habits  How to make your clothes last longer – it’s good for your bank account and the environment too  It’s not just weddings – how celebrating small wins and unconventional milestones can bring joy  They felt that this pressure came from various sources, including family and friends. They told us that others’ perceptions of how they looked affected their own feelings, both on the wedding day and afterwards. One said:  If you know other people think you look nice then you have more confidence.  Another told us:  I didn’t want to feel ashamed of my appearance. I knew there would be a lot of attention and comments on it. Didn’t want to feel like I’d let people down…there were lots of questions about my appearance and dresses mainly from other women. It felt like how I looked was part of the ‘decoration’ in the same way the table settings and order of service was.  Many of the women we spoke to felt the need to adhere to these pressures through fear of judgment and the expectation that all brides should look beautiful.  Looking back  The knowledge that wedding photographs and videos would provide permanent visual evidence of how they looked added to body image pressures. One said:  I wanted to look back at the photographs and feel 100% comfortable with what I saw.  The pressure felt by the women we spoke to also stemmed from the bridal industry, which perpetuates norms and assumptions about how brides should look. One woman, for example, talked about a bad experience she had in a bridalwear shop:  I felt the ladies in the dress shop were quite judgemental, saying I needed to eat better and basically lose weight, so I felt very negative towards me.  Nearly 70% of the women we spoke to who were planning their weddings intended to lose weight in preparation for their wedding day. The pressure to lose weight had a significant effect on their feelings and emotions. One said:  I’m really worried that preparing my weight for my wedding will re-trigger my anorexia and I don’t think people talk about the unnecessary pressure for brides and grooms to lose weight.  Some of the women reported going to extreme measures to achieve their weight-loss goals, including surgery. One had a gastric band fitted in the run-up to the wedding: this is a band around the stomach that limits its expansion, leading to feeling full sooner. Another had a tummy tuck – cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the stomach area.  Among the women we spoke to who were already married, only 27% had reached the weight they wanted to for their wedding. One said:  I was distressed when I realised I wouldn’t achieve this weight. I then felt fine approaching the day itself. However, I felt embarrassed after seeing photos of me and regretted getting married at my weight.  Our findings back up what other researchers have found in countries outside of the UK, such as in Australia and the US. This research has drawn attention to the powerful pressures related to wedding appearance and the expectation of how women should look when getting married.  If you are getting married, then it is completely natural for you to want to look your best, but prioritise your own wellbeing, too.  If one of your friends or family members is getting married, or if you work in the wedding industry, be conscious of what you are saying to the brides in your life. Make sure you are not inadvertently adding any pressures or expectations to them by commenting on their appearance during what can already be a stressful time. Focus on the joy and connection that is the real heart of a wedding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vaXQtZmVsdC1saWtlLWhvdy1pLWxvb2tlZC13YXMtcGFydC1vZi10aGUtZGVjb3JhdGlvbi1ob3ctZ2V0dGluZy13ZWQtYWZmZWN0cy13b21lbnMtYm9keS1pbWFnZS0yMDI4ODLSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2FtcC9pdC1mZWx0LWxpa2UtaG93LWktbG9va2VkLXdhcy1wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1kZWNvcmF0aW9uLWhvdy1nZXR0aW5nLXdlZC1hZmZlY3RzLXdvbWVucy1ib2R5LWltYWdlLTIwMjg4Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Parrott opened Parrott Floral Co. last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  CEDAR RAPIDS -- Cassie Parrott has expressed herself through flowers all of her adult life.  “For me, it’s the creative side, and getting to share my artistic abilities through florals,” Parrott said one recent morning. “I’m horrible at drawing or painting or anything like that, but when it comes to being creative on the flower side...”  Parrott, 32, began working for florists soon after graduating from Cedar Rapids Jefferson High School, just a few blocks from her home. She kept working while completing Kirkwood Community College’s horticulture program.

(Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Advertisement  Gaining some 15 years experience, Parrott and her husband, Joey, decided last year it was time to strike out on her own.  “I had been doing it for other businesses and just decided I wanted to be doing it for myself,” she said. “I knew what it all entailed, and what I needed.”  A small toolshed in her backyard became her studio, freshened with new paint and outfitted with work tables and a florist’s refrigerator to keep blooms fresh.  “Thankfully, we had this workshop,” she said. “It was just storage. We started converting, and it went really quickly after I decided I wanted to for-sure do it.”  Wedding specialty  Parrott’s goal is to specialize on weddings, but she’s taken other business during her start-up.  “From the beginning, I knew I was going to have to do some everyday retail,” she said. “Friends and family will say, ‘Hey, can you do a birthday bouquet for me tomorrow?’ And I can make it happen.”  Business News Newsletter Signup Newsletter Signup Delivered to your inbox weekdays Email Please wait...

Without a traditional storefront, which she didn’t want to invest in, Parrott typically begins the design process in customers’ homes, where being a one-woman operation has its advantages.  “I have the capabilities and the time to actually get to know each one of my brides and give my undivided attention to them and not have to worry about other customers coming in,” she said.  Large, elaborate displays are popular for this season’s weddings, she said.  “Big, colorful arches and hanging installations,” Parrott said. “Big statement pieces are the trendy things right now.”  Most customers have at least some idea what they’re after.  “A lot of times they have somewhat of a vision,” she said. “They’ve gone to Pinterest or Google or Instagram or TikTok and found pictures they like. I guide them and make it fit within their budget and make their vision come to life for them.”  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her home floral design studio in Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Using social media  Social media also is a key marketing tool.  “When you’re starting a business, anything free is helpful,” Parrott said. “Anytime we do a wedding and they post pictures and tag us in it, that helps spread the word.  “Those relationships with other wedding vendors help. A venue, a dress shop, a tux shop, a bakery, we all get together and make a mock wedding, and it’s photographed and we post that on our socials.”  Parrott works through a wholesale florist in Illinois and directly with big flower farms in Ecuador and Chile. In-season, she also buys locally grown blooms.  Managing deliveries, she said, is vital.  “When somebody’s buying a bouquet for a birthday or anniversary, they want that to last as long as possible. I want to get that in right before the occasion and get it out to them in the form where it’s barely started blooming,” she said. “With a wedding, they’re wanting (the full bloom). Depending what kinds of blooms, I have a process where I get them to their full potential for the wedding day.”  Friends, family help  Parrott is her namesake company’s sole full-time employee, but friends and family help with deliveries and building elaborate arrangements. Peak wedding season brings some early-morning starts.  “We’re always one of the first vendors at a wedding on Saturday,” she said. “You want to be in and out, so once they start with pictures that’s all done. By about noon I have everything set up.”  Cassie Parrott dyes flowers made out of wood shavings to create at floral arrangement for a client Wednesday at her home design studio in southwest Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Despite working through the pandemic’s lingering supply-chain effects -- Parrott estimates wholesale flower costs have tripled -- she’s optimistic about her business’ first busy season.  “When I opened, my main concern was just getting clients and getting my name out there as my business and myself,” she said. “But I’ve booked 11 weddings since September. For my first eight months, that seems like a pretty good number.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL215LWJpei1tYWtpbmctYS1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1mbG93ZXJzL9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL215LWJpei1tYWtpbmctYS1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1mbG93ZXJzLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, there were also many B-town celebs who decided to keep their wedding an intimate affair. The trend of having a secret and hush-hush wedding also started after the Covid-19 pandemic.  But, did you know that ‘Vivaah’ actress Amrita Rao married the love of her life RJ Anmol at a temple in Pune on a budget as low as Rs 1,50,000?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMRITA RAO 🇮🇳 (@amrita_rao_insta)  Recently, the couple released a YouTube video on their official channel wherein they elaborated on the cost of their wedding, the venue, and how they were able to pull off a close-knit shaadi in that budget.  In the ‘Anniversary Special’ episode of ‘Couple Of Things’, they took us down memory lane to the place they got married nine years ago.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The handful of people who attended their wedding traveled from Mumbai to Iskcon Temple in Katraj, Pune where the couple secretly tied the knot. As for the stay and other functions like Sangeet, Mehendi, and Karaoke Night, the couple booked a hotel on the outskirts of Pune.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The couple further revealed that the outfits they wore were very traditional and cost not more than Rs 3000 each because they didn’t want to wear designer clothes. The ‘Main Hoon Na’ actor also wore all artificial jewellery on her wedding day.  “When I told Anmol that I wanted to buy jewellery, he had told me ‘Abhi q shopping karni hai, tabhi karo na shaadi k baad.’ And when the wedding happened, we were busy building our house so we had no time to shop. So, I wore artificial jewellery top to bottom. I was very angry.”  In the video, the couple then visited their wedding venue and relived those fond memories.  Amrita further revealed that she also carried her makeup kit and did her wedding makeup herself. Her family members helped her get ready for the special occasion.  They also added that one of the reasons they wanted to get married in Pune was because Amrita’s grandparents were in Pune so it was easier for them to travel to the venue. Concluding the video, Amrita shared:  “We always believed that weddings should be about love, not about showing off wealth and ostentation. We wanted our wedding to be a beautiful, intimate affair with just our immediate families & close friends, and we’re glad we were able to achieve that without spending a fortune.”  To this, RJ Anmol added, “Our wedding was a reflection of our personalities, and we wanted to keep it humble.

Based on a book by Arpita Mukherjee and Sabrina Dhawan, the musical is conceived and directed by Nair, and “tries to capture the 2001 film’s spirit,” according to The New York Times.  The past few months have been magnificent working as music producer to @MiraPagliNair Monsoon Wedding. Our 1st preview marched off Saturday and opening night is this coming Saturday.

As event planners string marigold flower chains and pitch a pole tent for the festivities, mania ensues. The bride-to-be, Aditi, is torn between her feelings for her ex-lover and her soon-to-be husband, the wedding planner falls in love with the family’s maid, and buried family secrets come to the surface during the days-long celebration. “Nair’s celebration rings joyful and cathartic: as a love song to her home city of Delhi and to her own Punjabi family,” says the musical’s synopsis. “At its core, it’s a story of families: how they love, rejoice, and endure together.”  calling all nyers and well wishers to immediately go see Mira Nair’s brilliant *Monsoon Wedding: The Musical* pic.twitter.com/twgjkJRP5n — Manan Ahmed (@sepoy) May 14, 2023  The production was first staged in 2017 at Berkeley Repertory Theater, where it received mixed reviews, the Bay Area Player reported at the time. Work on the adaptation began in 2006, with Nair and the film’s screenwriter, Dhawan, collaborating with composer Vishal Bhardwaj and the lyricist Susan Birkenhead. Nair told The Times that “she’d been inspired by the 2004 Broadway revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” a show built around cultural traditions adapting to survive.  The Times further notes that “like the film, the musical touches upon the fallout of India’s 1947 partition, brought to life in the characters’ religious, social and economic differences. Nair told the publication that the film is about “our families, but so deeply universal — this essential story of understanding a whole society and movement through a very personal story.”  However, the musical deviates a little from the film, in terms of messaging. For the musical, Nair had to revisit one of the film’s subplots, she told The Times, “about a relative’s grooming and sexual abuse of two younger family members.” A “concerted effort” was made to have “the women question the patriarchy and speak up,” Nair said. “Other characters who are afflicted by this don’t shove it under the rug; they make decisions in their own lives that reflect that they will not accept this behavior, which we didn’t have before.”  The change is reflective of Nair’s work which “has never shied away from examining cultural distinctions,” The Times notes. “Mississippi Masala” (1991) explored the interracial romance between a Black man and Indian American woman, “Salaam Bombay!” (1988), revolved around children living in the slums.  “Monsoon Wedding” is currently playing at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, through June 25.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2FtZXJpY2Fua2FoYW5pLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3N0YWdlLWFkYXB0YXRpb24tb2YtbWlyYS1uYWlycy1tb25zb29uLXdlZGRpbmctbWFrZXMtY29uY2VydGVkLWVmZm9ydC10by1xdWVzdGlvbi1wYXRyaWFyY2h5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The actor, in a recent interview, said that she “never felt more beautiful on screen” and called it a “liberating experience”.  In a chat with ETimes, Shabana recalled an incident from the time she was shooting for the film and had to attend a wedding after pack up. She shared that the attire that she was shooting in was befitting for a wedding so she attended the function in the same clothes and jewellery. “I remember in 2022 while shooting in Delhi for Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, I had to attend a wedding one evening. After the day’s shooting, I just took off wearing the saree and jewellery that I was shooting in,” she said.  Shabana Azmi shared that the film’s costume designer Manish Malhotra was “horrified” and said, “How can you go to a wedding wearing shooting clothes and jewellery? At least let me give you real jewellery.” But Shabana asked him to “relax” as it would be completely fine. “And it was. I looked quite presentable at the wedding, if I may say so myself,” she added.  Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani is Karan Johar’s next directorial. It marks his return as a director after 2016’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (Karan directed shorts in Lust Stories and Ghost Stories, respectively). The film, also starring Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan, is scheduled to release on July 28.  In an earlier chat with Bollywood Life, Ranveer Singh described Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani as a “quintessential Karan Johar movie” and added, “It’s vintage Karan Johar, everything that you love about his films – the songs, the glamour, the good-looking leads, the family dynamics, the pulpy drama, the humour, the romance, it’s all packed in there; every trope you’ve seen in Karan Johar movies, his brand of cinema you have loved – all there.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC9ib2xseXdvb2Qvc2hhYmFuYS1hem1pLWF0dGVuZGVkLWEtd2VkZGluZy13ZWFyaW5nLXNob290aW5nLWNsb3RoZXMtcm9ja3ktYXVyLXJhbmkta2ktcHJlbS1rYWhhbmktbWFuaXNoLW1hbGhvdHJhLXdhcy1ob3JyaWZpZWQtODYxMzA4My_SAbwBaHR0cHM6Ly9pbmRpYW5leHByZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYm9sbHl3b29kL3NoYWJhbmEtYXptaS1hdHRlbmRlZC1hLXdlZGRpbmctd2VhcmluZy1zaG9vdGluZy1jbG90aGVzLXJvY2t5LWF1ci1yYW5pLWtpLXByZW0ta2FoYW5pLW1hbmlzaC1tYWxob3RyYS13YXMtaG9ycmlmaWVkLTg2MTMwODMvbGl0ZS8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Erin McGregor has revealed she will not be opting for a church wedding when she walks down the aisle in 2024. Pic: Erin McGregor/Instagram  One follower asked the pair if they had decided between 'a wedding singer or music in the church?' prompting the duo to reveal they wouldn't be opting for a church wedding.  Erin answered: 'We don't want a church... do you want to say why we don't want a church?  'Eh, because of Harry,' Terry simply stated.  'So, Harry would feel better in an outdoor [setting] so it wouldn't be as overwhelming and the noise wouldn't be as intense for him,' Erin explained.

The Gardeners' World star, 67, and his wife Sarah were pictured at their son's nuptials back in July 2020 – which happened to be their own wedding anniversary. For the occasion, the pair proved their penchant for florals as they stepped out in summery outfits that may have been inspired by their Herefordshire garden, Longmeadow.  WATCH: Monty Don shares personal garden transformation  Monty offset his classic white shirt and black suit with a blue tie covered with yellow flowers, while Sarah tied in with his colour scheme in a stunning pastel blue frock. It featured a high neckline, long sleeves, a ditsy floral print and navy piping which she teamed with pearl drop earrings and her blonde hair in a sleek straight bob.  The celebrity gardener captioned the candid photo, which appears to have been taken at the wedding breakfast: ""3 years ago on this day Sarah and I were celebrating our son Adam’s marriage to Emily. On the same day 37 years ago we were married too.""  © Instagram Monty and Sarah's son got married in 2017  At the time, fans rushed to comment on the couple's outfits, writing: ""Look at you all poshed up,"" and: ""I love the tie."" A third added: ""Lucky Monty, Sarah is a beauty.""  Monty and Sarah chose much more timeless outfits on their own wedding day. On their 39th anniversary in 2022, he shared one rare throwback photo, taken in 1983, which showed the newlyweds standing outside a set of wrought iron gates, with Monty's new wife rocking an unconventional blue outfit.  Sarah ditched bridal white for a dusty cornflower jacket with large buttons down the front, which she paired with a chunky necklace and matching earrings.  Meanwhile, Monty didn't appear to have aged at all – he sported the same thick curly hair and big grin and wore a cream suit and black spotty tie.  He accompanied the photo with a heartfelt message to his childhood sweetheart Sarah, whom he met at Cambridge University. ""We got married 39 years ago today - the picture is a little faded, a little wrinkly, like us but the love is as evergreen and strong now as it was all those years ago,"" Monty sweetly wrote.  Monty and Sarah share three children, Tom, Adam and Freya, and they are proud grandparents to George and Daisy Rose. However, Sarah candidly opened up about her ill health following childbirth and the impact it had on their marriage in their book, The Jewel Garden.  ""I was ill for months after our daughter was born despite having had a supposedly film-star birth at an enormously expensive private London hospital,"" Sarah wrote. ""I had a slipped disc, a result of the bodged delivery, and was so anaemic that I needed a blood transfusion.  ""My injuries were not acknowledged and as we tried to leave the hospital I had to walk down three flights of stairs because the lift had broken. I was unable to walk or stand properly for over a year,"" she shared.  Being bedridden put a strain on their relationship, with Sarah candidly writing: ""When it came down to it, Montagu was a loony and I was ill all the time.""

She donned a pink, peachy shade that was minimal, yet memorable – perfectly in line with her understated elegance and effortless personal style.  On her wedding day, Richie told Vogue that she wanted her look to feel timeless. Richie enlisted makeup artist Pati Dubroff, who leaned into subtle enhancements to the star’s natural beauty. Paired with a glossy gold lid and sunkissed blush, Dubroff accentuated her lips with a sheerness that wasn’t too saturated. “We wanted the lips to look fresh and soft, and not have a weighty lipstick feeling. Kissable lips!” she explains. In the end, this was achieved with a Chanel tinted lip balm accompanied by a natural contour shade lip pencil.  Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Hydrating Beautifying Tinted Lip Balm Buildable Colour £34 at CHANEL  Part of the intrigue of Rouge Coco Baume is how it veils the lips in a practical, buildable colour. As you layer your chosen shade, the finish transforms from a sheer, barely there color to a more opaque and luminous pigment. Richie’s lip was done with shade 928 Pink Delight, one of nine shades that range from rich reds to iridescent pearls. My personal favorite? 914 Natural Charm, which enhances my pout’s natural colour.  “The Rouge Coco Baume range is hydrating and my constant go to!” Dubroff says, admitting that the formula is perfect for not only summer but in cooler temperatures when lips are more easily chapped. Why? The balm is enriched with a fruit and olive leaf-derived oil that boasts antioxidant and rejuvenation benefits – meaning lips are soft, hydrated, and smoother upon application. With its conditioning properties and sheer, never-shiny tint, it’s safe to say I’ve found my ultimate summer lip.

"wedding","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:02","The coronation of King Charles III was brimming with historical moments, but the Princess of Wales wearing a custom bejewelled headpiece instead of a tiara was not one I saw coming. There were whispers leading up to the day that Kate would forgo crown jewels at the request of the King because he wanted a more modest ceremony (not sure if we would call this event less opulent, but okay). And veering far from tradition, Kate chose a bespoke leafy-floral headpiece crafted from sequins, metallic beading and sparkling silver threadwork by Jess Collett X Alexander McQueen. It was a royal fashion moment for the books (as was the matching smaller version of the headpiece worn by Princess Charlotte), and one that has tipped off a trend of exquisite and elaborate bejewelled wedding headpieces as coveted accessory.  “I thought Catherine’s headpiece conveyed a youthful and whimsical vibe,” says Toronto-based accessory designer Blair Nadeau, founder and owner of Blair Nadeau Bridal Adornments, who is renowned for her exquisite jewellery, veils, hair accessories and crowns. “I literally squealed when I saw it. This accessory didn’t feel old and stuffy, it felt fresh. I loved the tiered leaf and floral motif and the doubled-banded style. The look is perfect for a wedding because it’s elegant and impactful and very modern feeling.”  Nadeau says the organic shape of Kate’s instantly iconic headpiece is what makes it easy and effortless for brides to wear. “We are still in a bit of a minimalist era but starting to see the emergence of softer silhouettes and more texture with three-dimensional details like floral embellishments and lace patterns,” she shares. “The silver tone provided an airy lightness that is very much happening now with accessories after years of bold gold designs.”  If you’re feeling the luxe headpiece vibe for your wedding day, Nadeau has a few thoughts on how to wear them. Pair a design like Kate’s with a light and airy dress with a fluid silhouette made from tulle, chiffon or lace. She also recommends keeping hair easy and not overly styled. “I actually love the juxtaposition of soft waves with a statement headpiece,” says Nadeau. “If you do wear it up, keep it soft and a little imperfect, not too sleek.”  As for adding other wedding accessories, keep it simple and classic. Kate opted for a pair of diamond and South Sea pearl drop earrings that belonged to Princess Diana, which Nadeau says worked because they complemented the motif of her headpiece. “I actually love a veil combined with a statement headpiece, but the trick is to keep it simple and minimal,” she says. “Always remember your wedding accessories are there to complement you and your dress.”  Bejewelled wedding headpieces to shop now  This bold trend is here to stay for several wedding seasons  The shape and finish of the Victoria headpiece is very much in step with the Princess of Wales’s style on Coronation day. It’s the perfect match for big, bold and volumized hair!  The Arielle headband by Jennifer Behr was first launched in 2010 and continues to be a runaway bestseller. It features hundreds of Swarovski-crystal-adorned leaves fastened to a silver ribbon-wrapped skinny headband.  The Millaray crown features a dramatic criss-cross design that creates a delicate and bold effect. Crafted from crystal beads, enamel and brass flowers, sterling-silver-plated wire and Mokuba silk ribbon, this piece is truly breathtaking.  The Cecilia headband is bedazzling hand-crafted custom piece that can take up to 16 weeks to receive from order date, so plan accordingly. This beauty is hanndmade from rhodium plating and is detailed with fresh water pearls and Swarovski crystals.  The Henri headband mixes pearls and crystals to create a maximum impact wedding accessory. This one would look amazing as a re-wear for any weddings or formal events on your upcoming calendar.  This is an amazing piece of hair jewellery that is very deco-inspired! It wraps around your head and is anchored by two dazzling leaf motifs on either side—so dramatic and so different!  We love the vintage vibe bow design of this glittering headband by designer Keren Wolf. This halo-style headpiece is easy to wear and pairs beautifully with easy, breezy wedding hair.

"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Atlanta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:43:18","There are several widely accepted rules for wedding speeches: Don’t talk about exes. Don’t dredge up drunken antics. And whatever you do, don’t wing it.  But a new etiquette question has recently emerged: Can you use AI to write them?  Couples and their loved ones are putting ChatGPT to the emotional Turing test, as they seek to give vows and toasts that are personal and eloquent but don’t rely on a writerly touch. What they’re finding is that AI can’t beat a human on the feelings front—phew!—but it can perhaps help prompt memories or create structure.  Ten days before her wedding, Kelly Tenn, 35, found herself on the planning website Joy, answering prompts from its free AI speechwriting tool, which relies on OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology.  “For me, there’s obviously this big craze around AI tools over the past few months, and I was a bit skeptical to try to use a tool like this,"" said Ms. Tenn, a brand-marketing executive for a cloud-technology company in San Francisco. She doesn’t find writing hard—“I work in content,"" she said—but for vows “it takes a little bit more creativity in how you articulate something that is summarizing your relationship over many years and years to come.""  Ms. Tenn used the product to create multiple versions of AI-generated vows, including prose “spoken like a friend"" and “Shakespearean-style verbiage"" (“So often have I pondered our love and asked, wherefrom hath thy love descended so unexpectedly?""). Ultimately she scrapped the drafts, which she found basic and nondescript, but she said using the tool helped her break out of writer’s block.  The tool also eased her woes about getting up in front of a crowd on her wedding day. “Public speaking is not something I prefer to do,"" Ms. Tenn said. “This is one of many ways to help lower the barrier and alleviate nerves.""  Write Your Own Vows Using AI  Let’s write vows to an imaginary spouse. Once you answer these questions, the AI tool ChatGPT will generate vows based on your responses.  Ahead of their April wedding, Jeff and Allison Hood of Atlanta used Provenance’s toast and vow builder, which launched in early 2023. It prompts each partner to share stories, memories and promises for their future spouse. Through the service, which costs $19.99, each partner can also view the relative length and tone of their significant others’ vows without seeing the contents.  “There was really nothing that didn’t sound like my authentic voice,"" said Mr. Hood, 34, a custom clothier. Since he’s “not a novelist,"" he was grateful that the tool presented his thoughts in a way that flowed well.  Ms. Hood, 32 and head of growth for a digital-marketing agency, kept a running list in her phone of all the things she loves about her partner since they started dating four years ago. “They’re just like ‘I stubbed my toe and he brought me a Band-Aid and I felt so special,’"" she said. “It wasn’t something I could actually say on my wedding day.""  Left to her own devices, Ms. Hood said her vows would have sounded as though they had been written by a second-grader: “Will you marry me? Check ‘yes’ or ‘no.’"" Reading what Provenance came up with, she thought, “‘Wow, I would have never worded it this way and it sounds so thoughtful—and the way that I actually feel.’""  Less than two weeks before giving a rehearsal-dinner toast for a best friend’s wedding, Randi Kramer, 29, thought: How do I capture nearly a decade of friendship in just a few minutes? Another friend suggested she try ToastWiz, a paid service for crafting speeches that uses AI.  “More than anything, it was a tool that got me past writer’s block,"" said Ms. Kramer, an associate editor at a publishing house in New York City. Thanks to prompts the form gave her—such as asking for adjectives to describe the couple and a favorite anecdote about the bride—Ms. Kramer was finally able “to get the juices flowing.""  She paid $30 for three speech drafts. “I was able to Frankenstein it together,"" she said, estimating that a third of what the chatbot produced made it into her final speech.  “I definitely didn’t tell anyone,"" she said, of using the service.  Julia Rosenson, 25, a software engineer in New York City, used Joy’s service to help write her maid of honor speech for her sister’s coming September wedding. While she’s found it to be “a fun little tool"" to play with, Ms. Rosenson said it should only be used for inspiration.  “It’s pretty hit or miss—mostly miss—just because they don’t know my sister at all,"" she said, “but they put together a whole story,"" adding that it was quite funny to read. “It generates anecdotes as if I were going to tell a story about my sister and her fiancé on a camping trip they never took, or some pivotal imaginary relationship moment,"" Ms. Rosenson said.  Joy’s CEO Vishal Joshi said the tool’s invented anecdotes should be seen as placeholders for personal material. “It will make up interesting stories where it could be like, ‘OK, a story quote over here would be nice,’"" he said.  Kyle and Sarah Kuo, both 26, of Tempe, Ariz., used Provenance to prepare for their April 2023 wedding. Ms. Kuo, a registered nurse at an outpatient family practice, especially liked the fact that you could cross-check your partner’s vows to make sure you were on the same page, tone-wise.  “You don’t want to put too many jokes in there if your partner is being serious and sentimental,"" she said.  For his part, Mr. Kuo, a director of operations at a production company, was just glad to have his time back.  “I would have had to Google ‘how to write your vows’ and read through, you know, nine articles,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFscy93b3VsZC15b3UtdXNlLWFpLXRvLXdyaXRlLXlvdXItd2VkZGluZy12b3dzLXRoZXktZGlkLTExNjg0MjU0MzY0MjY2Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vc3BlY2lhbHMvd291bGQteW91LXVzZS1haS10by13cml0ZS15b3VyLXdlZGRpbmctdm93cy10aGV5LWRpZC9hbXAtMTE2ODQyNTQzNjQyNjYuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2022-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:21:00","Ukrainian troops train to use commercial drones to spot and target enemy forces in Kharkiv Oblast in August. Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  In the days after Russia's invasion last year, Ukrainian forces need help targeting Russian troops.  One Ukrainian artillery unit relied on help from Ukrainian civilians to guide their strikes.  Using repurposed drones, cameras and phones, and Google Maps, that unit put rounds on its targets.  Hobby drones and Google Maps were designed to enhance human life, not to end it, but when Russian tank columns seemed to be closing in on Kyiv in the days after Russia's attack on February 24, 2022, desperate Ukrainian defenders found they had two unlikely assets.  Col. Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine's 43rd Artillery Brigade, and Col. Serhiy Ogerenko, the brigade's chief of staff, told Ukrainian media that they were able to use civilian drones and Google Maps, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian civilians, to locate and target Russian forces in the early days of the war.  At the time, Ukrainian gunners faced the problem of hitting Russian vehicles — moving targets — without trained forward observers to estimate where the vehicle would be when the shell landed.  ""That's why we needed 'eyes,'"" Ogerenko said. ""We called civilians and asked, 'Do you see this section of the road? If a shell hits in a minute and a half, can you tell us at least roughly where it exploded?' Then the person would describe the place of the explosion, and we would open a Google map and see, yes, there is such a place behind the vegetable gardens.""  A woman uses her smartphone in a house damaged by shelling in southeastern Kyiv in March 2022. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images  Civilians also offered to use their hobby drones as scouts and artillery spotters. DJI Mavic quadcopters — nicknamed ""wedding drones"" because that is what they were used to record before the war — proved invaluable to the 43rd Artillery Brigade.  ""They provided the picture,"" Shevchuk said, according to a translation of the interview. ""4G, WhatsApp, a video call — the cameraman picked up, saw something, took off his phone, and said, 'look what I have.' I looked at it and said, 'hold it. We're going to shoot now.' It was convenient.""  Story continues  Drones — both military-designed and civilian models — are among the most vital assets for troops on both sides of the war. Ukrainian and Russian drones prowl the skies constantly, looking for enemy positions and movements, as well as for artillery batteries, supply depots, and command posts.  Shevchuk recounted how ""one guy from a gas station even gave us access to his camera."" Rather than explain the situation to Ukrainian gunners, the owner told them, ""'here's the password. See for yourself,'"" Shevchuk recalled. ""That's how we saw our first live target — a column of Chechens near Novyi Bykiv [37 miles from Kyiv] heading towards Kyiv. So we 'met' them three kilometers [1.9 miles] further.""  A drone operator corrects Ukrainian 82mm mortar fire toward Russian positions in the Donetsk region in April. SERGEY SHESTAK/AFP via Getty Images  Sometimes Ukrainian forces would get indications that Russian troops were in a village, but not their precise location. ""We open a Google map, see a store, see its phone number, and dial it,"" said Shevchuk, who described a typical conversation:  ""Good evening, we are from Ukraine! Do you have any Katsaps [Ukrainian slur for Russians] in the village?"" ""Yes."" ""Where?"" ""Behind Grandma Hanna's house."" ""What house does Grandma Hanna have?"" ""Well, everyone knows her!""  ""So you talk to people a little bit and realize where everything is,"" Shevchuk added.  This isn't the only example of how Ukrainian civil society is using consumer technology to enhance Ukraine's military capabilities. To cope with waves of Russian long-range drones penetrating deep into Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainian military has formed mobile air-defense teams equipped with short-range anti-aircraft weapons.  Ordinary citizens can use cellphone apps to report drone sightings to a central database, which can then alert mobile air-defense units.  Ukrainian troops fire an 2S7 Pion howitzer at Russian positions near Bakhmut in March. Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Ukrainians using video cameras and cellphones to call in artillery fire on Russians forces as they pass by is a bizarre, almost comical, illustration of how a modern war can play out in an urban environment. But it also shows how much danger those civilians faced from invaders intent on defeating Ukraine's military and then repressing the Ukrainian public.  Russian troops and Wagner Group mercenaries have been accused of numerous atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, and Moscow has clamped down on Ukrainians living in areas it still controls in an effort to prevent attacks by partisans or special-operations forces. Anyone suspected of providing intelligence to Ukraine's devastatingly effective artillery could expect little mercy.  ""We lost contact with many people, and some said: 'That's it, I'm turning off my phone, deleting all my contacts. There are Russians in the next house,'"" Shevchuk said of civilians his forces were in contact with. ""Some people immediately said: 'I'm scared, don't ask me any questions.' But people called us from everywhere.""  Michael Peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in Forbes, Defense News, Foreign Policy magazine, and other publications.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:00:00","AN invitation to a wedding is a bit of a two-edged sword.  There’s the compliment of being asked to celebrate the nuptials of friends, making you feel a tiny bit important, or at least, definitely not a c-lister.  The c-listers are relegated to the ‘insult’ otherwise known as the ‘afters’ where sandwiches are served and you might be offloaded with a slice of wedding cake.  The afters really are something of an after-thought for people that don’t make the grade but can’t be completely forgotten about either.  Are they expected to give a gift to the couple? It’s a bit of a minefield.  Thankfully, most of my friends are not the marrying kind so I haven’t been encumbered with the diplomatic shenanigans involved in trying to decide on a gift versus cash. I believe cash is king. (There’s no point in buying a toaster or some other kitchen implement for a couple that will most likely have been living together for years and have everything they need.)  But what is really tricky is the invitation to a destination wedding. It’s all very well if you decide to get married on a beach in Bali in flip flops and a floaty white dress. But think of the guests.  A couple may find it hard to believe, but travelling for a wedding is often seen as hassle and as expensive.  It requires taking some of your annual leave from work, which you might really resent, having hoped to save your days off to go on a decent holiday of your own choice.  You really may not want to have to rock up somewhere in Italy for a wedding event that, in the old days, used to just take place over the course of a day.  It’s downright cheeky to assume that your friends and family will welcome a wedding abroad. While close family members have no choice but to follow the couple to a hired villa in France or wherever, friends will be counting the cost.  You’re talking a few grand (at least €2,000) which is a big ask for a guest. There’s all the logistics of getting from the airport to the wedding venue which might be hours away, somewhere deep in the Italian countryside.  Scenic and romantic? Certainly, but far from practical.  Whatever happened to the Saturday wedding in a hotel serving beef or salmon? Now, folk want to emulate celebrities with their fancy notions involving hiring a wedding planner and dragging their mates abroad because ‘it’s all about the experience’.  Yes, making memories can be expensive.  But now you have the perfect excuse to decline an invitation to a wedding in some far-flung place. It’s our old enemy – the carbon footprint.  Can you really justify a flight when at least 2.4% of global emissions come from aviation?  Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming.  While that may not seem like a massive contributor, only a small percentage of the world flies frequently. It’s for the relatively rich and indulgent.  Put that on your wedding invitation refusal and you should be off the hook. (On the other hand, if you have plenty of time on your hands, you could indulge in ‘slow travel’ using boats and trains and coaches to get to the celebrations). Now that could be a great and memorable trip. But time may not be on your side.  Most of us are wage slaves unable to dedicate days and days to just travelling to a destination.  According to a BBC report, a return flight from London to San Francisco emits around 5.5 tonnes of CO2 per person, more than twice the emissions produced by a family car in a year and about half of the average carbon footprint of someone living in the UK.  Even a fairly short return flight from London to Berlin emits three times the emissions saved from a year of recycling.  A study involving 29 international students asked them to rate the importance of different flights they had taken. Just 58% of the flights were rated ‘very important’ or ‘important’.  And really, how important is a flight to the Caribbean for a wedding party?  Unless you’re close family, you’d be justified in turning down the invitation – on environmental grounds.  Some people compensate for the emissions from their flights by buying a carbon offset. But this is a bit of a cod. Trees, for example, need years to grow enough to reabsorb the carbon from your flight, and there’s no guarantee they’ll be left standing long enough to counteract your flight emissions.  That kind of thing is for the wealthy who continue contributing to climate change, offsetting, but not changing their behaviour.  The solution to destination weddings? Elope. Just the two of you.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjaG9saXZlLmllL2Nvcmt2aWV3cy9hcmlkLTQxMTQwMzk5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Sophie, 30, from Stanton Harcourt, and Thames Water employee Shane, 26, from Sutton, and got together at Bartholomew School in Eynsham when Sophie was 13.  The bride recalled: ""I’ve been with Shane half my life but we were planning to get married in a few years’ time in Turkey.

Alyssa and Duncan were matched on the experiment together and after a series of ups and downs, Duncan eventually called it a day on their relationship.  Talking about her MAFS Australia wedding, Alyssa told Hello! Magazine she told Duncan she was a single parent and was disappointed it was never aired for viewers to see.  “I don’t know why they didn’t show it, it totally perpetuates the stigma around single parents,” she said. “It was suddenly revealed like, ‘I have a child. I have a child’.  “And then people were like, ‘When did she even tell him? When is she going to tell him?’ And I said, ‘Well guys, I was really upfront and honest, I told him straight away!’ I literally do not know why they didn’t show it,” Alyssa explained about their wedding on MAFS Australia.  Duncan has recently moved on from Alyssa and is now in a relationship with his co-star Evelyn Ellis. The happy couple announced the news in a Honesty Box session with 9Entertainment and it was incredibly wholesome.  “All of a sudden we went on a couple of nights, and some of the warm fuzzy feelings happened in my stomach and I thought, ‘What’s this? How we going here?’ Then one thing led to another,” Duncan said explaining how they started dating.

Kelly Piquet ended up attending the wedding alone, posting pictures of herself in a red, feathered dress on Instagram.  1 Piquet enjoyed the wedding despite Verstappen's absence. Credit: Kelly Piquet via Instagram  She titled the post “Lady in red” but did not explain her boyfriend’s absence from the event.  The answer can be found on Twitch where Verstappen was streaming himself racing in the virtual 24 Hours of Nurburgring.  The current world champion F1 driver was racing as part of his virtual F1 Team Redline streaming with another member Chris Lulham.  Verstappen apparently decided to join the competition at the last minute after Lulham had complained about the amount of work he had to do for his upcoming exams.  Lulham was on the call talking with Verstappen while the F1 driver took part in the race.  During the race Lulham tries to defend himself saying: “If I had raced I would have had to rock up with like five hours break.”  However, Verstappen quickly cuts him off saying: “I cancelled a wedding for it.”  Lulham suggests that Verstappen was happy to cancel his plans though saying: “Don’t tell me this isn’t what you’d rather be doing.”  To which Verstappen replies: “I love sim racing, but sometimes you have to think about the greater good.”  Verstappen has previously shown that he is almost as passionate about virtual F1 racing as he is about the real deal.  He slammed Le Mans Virtual’s organisers after issues with the servers prevented him from finishing.  Recently, he installed a full F1 simulator in his £12million private jet so that he can practise on the go.  Despite Verstappen’s absence, Piquet appears to have had a great time at the wedding, with a fan commenting on her post that Piquet even managed to catch the bouquet.

Princess Anne's daughter tied the knot with Mike Tindall on 30 July 2011 at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, stepping out of the car with her father Captain Mark Phillips wearing a gown by Stewart Parvin, one of her grandmother's favourite couturiers. The long ivory silk dress featured a Duchess satin trim and a chevron pleated corseted bodice, which she teamed with a fine tulle veil secured in place with a precious Greek tiara known as Princess Andrew's Meander Tiara.  WATCH: Zara and Mike Tindall spotted for the first time following their wedding ceremony  But did you know the headpiece, estimated to be worth £280,000 ($350,000), had a special meaning?  Zack Stone from Seven Stone explained: ""It’s a particularly sentimental piece as Princess Alice gave it to Queen Elizabeth II as a wedding present in 1947, who later passed it on to Zara’s mother, Princess Anne.  © Getty Zara's Greek tiara was given to Queen Elizabeth on her wedding day  ""Made of diamonds, the tiara's Greek key design is punctuated by a central laurel wreath element and two honeysuckle elements. The design suggests an early twentieth-century creation, with the earliest photos of Princess Alice wearing the tiara having been taken around 1914.  LOOK: Princess Anne's colour-clashing wedding guest dresses are like nothing you've ever seen  ""I’d estimate the striking piece to be worth £280,000 ($350,000).""  Zara and Mike got married in Edinburgh in 2011  The honeysuckles on the 'something borrowed' piece from Prince Philip's mother Princess Alice of Battenberg are said to symbolise pure happiness, while the laurel wreath design was used as a Greek symbol of triumph – both fitting for Olympic equestrian Zara's big day.  For the royal wedding, mother-of-the-bride Princess Anne looked striking in a peach pleated dress, cream and pink embroidered jacket and an elaborate lace and flower detail fascinator, while the Queen also chose a pastel pink ensemble accessorised with a beautiful diamond lapel brooch.  © Getty Anne wore a pink pleated mother of the bride dress  Zara wasn't the only member of the royal family to turn to Queen Elizabeth's jewellery collection for her wedding day. Princess Anne borrowed Queen Mary's Fringe Tiara – worn by her mother in 1947 – for her nuptials in 1973, which was then loaned to Princess Beatrice for her low-key pandemic wedding with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020.  Meanwhile, Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara, and the Duchess of Sussex wore Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara – a last-minute change after originally being offered the late Princess Diana's glittering headpiece.  It is not known who inherited the accessories after the Queen passed away in September 2022. It's possible they will continue to be passed down and may now belong to Princess Anne, who already loaned tiaras to her daughter Zara and former daughter-in-law Autumn Phillips.

Quoting from the comedy Borat, he recalls, ""My first thought was, 'Wa-wa-wee-wa!' I didn't know what to think. She looked incredible – stunning!"" Familiar faces from Jono And Ben, 7 Days and Funny Girls, the lovebirds – known together as comedy duo Two Hearts – married on 30 December 2022 at Nadia Lim's Royalburn Farm in the Crown Ranges near Arrowtown.  A-list guests, including Hilary Barry, Rose Matafeo, Chris Parker, Brynley Stent, Tom Sainsbury and Hayley Sproull, descended on the Queenstown-Lakes District for three fun-filled days of festivities. Laura laughs, ""We seriously considered eloping because we felt huge pressure to have this amazing wedding!""  The blooming gorgeous bride gets a cuddle from Rose.  Fortunately, the spectacular day went off without a hitch – and Laura, 32, and Joseph, 34, are now Zooming in to chat about it from Australia after sell-out gigs at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. By the time you read this, they'll have performed in Wellington. And this week, it's Auckland's turn to see their show Til Death Do Us Hearts, which they describe as ""an intimate evening of songs about love, life and maintaining a successful relationship with your co-worker"". But back to the wedding… The fun-loving couple wanted their big day to be full of excitement and surprises for everyone, so it started with a laugh-a-minute bus ride to the venue, featuring some of their favourite pop songs and hilarious mock commentary from a voiceover artist who introduces the fireworks at Disneyland. Joseph jokes he spent ""five times longer"" on this part of the wedding than he did his vows! Former Seven Sharp reporter Laura has stayed good friends with Nadia ever since the 2019 season of Dancing With The Stars and says the MasterChef judge's farm, with its stunning views out to Lake Wakatipu, made for a ""special"" venue. She adds, ""I went to Nadia's the night before and they've got a little apartment I stayed in. Nadia was heavily pregnant at the time, but she still made me dinner, which was so cute!"" Laughing, Joseph jokes, ""It was just a My Food Bag.""  The bride with pregnant pal Nadia and her husband Carlos Bagrie.  The ceremony was sweet and simple – the only real tradition they followed was Laura spending the night apart from her groom. She explains, ""We spend our lives so deeply intertwined. This was the one thing we could do to be like, 'OK, let's build this up!'"" Being reunited at the altar was a powerful moment. An uncharacteristically serious Joseph says, ""We're always going to treasure that memory."" They both get emotional recalling groomsmen Paul Williams (Taskmaster NZ) and Nic Sampson (The Brokenwood Mysteries) bursting into tears. Joseph adds, ""I really like that we made a lot of our friends cry to a Jason Derulo song!"" True to their nature, a few details were left to the last minute. Joseph says, ""I remember I emailed the suit makers, 'Hello, I'd like one wedding suit please,' and they replied, 'When's your wedding?' When I told them it was in a month, they were like, 'But we have to make it in Italy!'"" Fortunately, it arrived three days before they left for Queenstown.  The bridal party (from left): Alice Harbourne, Simone Nathan,  Steph Badham, Eli Matthewson, Brynley Stent and Zara Cormack.  Similarly, Laura says, ""We both wrote our vows the night before the wedding."" She'd sought help from newlywed comedian Chris, who told her, ""The vows will just come to you."" She says she and Joseph often have to write jokes under pressure for work, adding, ""That's when our best stuff comes out!"" The reception was under a huge tent decorated with fairy lights and flowers. There were games, speeches, drinks and  a vegetarian dinner. As for the first dance, Laura says, ""We didn't do a big, choreographed number, which a few people were expecting, but we did a cute sway side to side."" The party went on into the early hours of the morning, with dancing, singing and a saxophonist playing alongside the DJ. ""It was really going off!"" Laura exclaims delightedly. And then it was round two of partying the next day for New Year's Eve, with the newlyweds heading off on honeymoon to Hawaii. ""It rocked – I had the best time!"" declares Laura, prompting Joseph to ask, ""The honeymoon or the wedding?"" ""Both!"" Laura quickly chirps, adding that Disneyland was also on the itinerary – a visit that inspired a song in Til Death Do Us Hearts, which is part of the New Zealand International Comedy Festival.  The newlyweds honeymooned in Disneyland.  The pair first performed as a duo, but just as friends, back in 2017, with the final song in their act being about how they would never end up together. Now they're performing in Aotearoa for the first time as husband and wife, although they insist not much has changed. ""We're still renting with a flatmate and our lives are still very much the same, but it's nice to call him my husband now and to celebrate the milestones,"" says Laura. Joseph agrees, explaining that the main reason for them getting married was to create ""memories of such a special day with family and friends"". ""The lead-up to the wedding was so stressful,"" adds Laura. ""We thought, 'What are we doing?!' But then we had the wedding and were like, 'Hell, yeah, that was absolutely worth it!'"" Clearly still besotted with each other, Laura and Joseph pause when asked what's coming up for them. Laura is pensive. ""I guess we're in a phase of deciding what to do next with our lives,"" she reflects, adding that sell-out Aussie shows and one of their videos going viral in Europe have made moving overseas a temptation. International audiences are very vocal, tells Laura.  You can see their love for real in Til Death Do Us Hearts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vd3RvbG92ZS5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2VkZGluZ3MvbGF1cmEtZGFuaWVsLWpvc2VwaC1tb29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTQ3MDUx0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm93dG9sb3ZlLmNvLm56L2FtcC9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2VkZGluZ3MvbGF1cmEtZGFuaWVsLWpvc2VwaC1tb29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTQ3MDUx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2021-01-21","10:00:00","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 22:00:52","In their latest Netflix stand-up special, Something Special, lesbian genderqueer comedian Hannah Gadsby revealed that they were intent on having a Christian bakery provide their wedding cake. Of course, that required a little trickery.  Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in January 2021. In an April 2021 social media post announcing their union, the couple said they felt “chuffed about it.” (Chuffed is British slang for “very pleased.”)  “For the record: this is me gushing,” Gadsby wrote in the caption. “I am full of very positive feelings. This is a nice story.”  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  In their new special, which Gadsby describes as “a feel-good show,” the comedian shares more details about their wedding, including the story behind their hilariously non-traditional novelty wedding cake.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake,” Gadsby explains in Something Special, “and it worked.”  Gadsby recently shared a photo of the cake in question on their Instagram. It features a massive shark about to devour two adorable otters swimming serenely side-by-side.  “I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10,’” Gadsby recalls in their special. “Easy. So gullible. Will believe anything, Christians.”  Cakes have, of course, become one of the most unexpected battlegrounds in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. (Just imagine what Harvey Milk or veterans of the Stonewall uprising would’ve said if you told them that, in 2023, we would be suing bakers over cakes.)  In probably the most famous instance of cake discrimination, Jack Phillips, the anti-gay owner of Colorado’s Masterpiece Cakeshop, sued the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) in 2015 after it told him that his refusal to provide an LGBTQ+ couple’s wedding cake violated the state’s law prohibiting businesses open to the public from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Phillips, but did not rule on the question of whether he had a First Amendment right to refuse to make a gay wedding cake.  Phillips was sued again in 2018, this time by a trans customer for whom he refused to make a cake celebrating both her birthday and her anniversary of coming out as trans. In 2021, a Denver judge ruled that Phillips illegally discriminated against Autumn Scardina when he refused to make the cake. Earlier this year, the Colorado Court of Appeals again ruled against Phillips in the case.  More recently, in Florida, a Publix grocery store refused to write “Trans People Deserve Joy” on a cake for a trans nonprofit organization. The company later apologized, claiming that employees at the Orland-area store were mistaken in believing that writing a trans-affirming message on a cake was against corporate policy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3F1ZWVyLWNvbWVkaWFuLWhhbm5haC1nYWRzYnktdHJpY2tlZC1hLWNocmlzdGlhbi1iYWtlcnktaW50by1tYWtpbmctdGhlaXItd2VkZGluZy1jYWtlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Bell Tower on 34th has also opened this new boutique, smaller outdoor ballroom space to offer smaller wedding parties a more intimate space that encourages close connection between guests.  More information is available at https://thebelltoweron34th.com  Responding to the trend for more intimate weddings, where the bride and groom really get the opportunity to share their special day with their loved ones, The Bell Tower on 34th has created an open-air, outdoor ballroom that is suitable for small parties and for micro weddings with 50 guests or fewer. The event planners at The Bell Tower on 34th believe that, for small weddings, their new outdoor ballroom is both open and airy, which creates a sense of spaciousness, with room to eat, drink and dance, without feeling cavernous or empty.  With their new outdoor ballroom space, The Bell Tower on 34th can still offer guests the same high-quality personalized service that characterizes the larger weddings they have become known for.  As a part of their new intimate small wedding packages, The Bell Tower on 34th will offer couples the food service of their in-house executive chef and award-winning catering team. Small and micro wedding hosts can also now enjoy the support and assistance of their experienced and dedicated in-house wedding coordinators.

"wedding","1938-10-12","Not Discerned","{""SanFrancisco"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:52:00","The Most Expensive Slice Of Wedding Cake Ever Sold Was Decades Old  While it obviously depends on what you serve, food is typically one of the biggest expenses for any wedding. This category includes everything from appetizers that circulate during the cocktail hour to late-night snacks — and, of course, the wedding cake.  Given the tradition of the bride and groom cutting the cake together, many couples are very particular about their wedding cake. That means they're often willing to pay a bit extra for a truly show-stopping creation. However, the most expensive slice of wedding cake ever sold probably isn't something you'd want to consider eating — given that it was over 80 years old at the time of sale.  Back in 1998, two individuals in San Francisco made Guinness World Records history. Their feat? Shelling out a staggering $29,900 U.S. dollars in order to purchase a single piece of wedding cake, packaged in a box and sold at auction. Though the crew at Sotheby's figured the sweet treat from decades past would fetch somewhere between $500 and $1,000, Benjamin and Amanda Yin were willing to pay a whole lot more for the item.  In truth, they were buying a slice of history. The piece of the cake in question was served at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937. The couple relished the romance that the purchase represented. They were willing to pay top dollar for a slice of cake that they would never even get to taste because of its connection to the historic event.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTI4ODA3OS9tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1zbGljZS13ZWRkaW5nLWNha2Utc29sZC1kZWNhZGVzLW9sZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Target  Shop now: $35; target.com  The heels are available in sizes six through 12 — plus half sizes — along with two widths and six colors, like neutral beige and summer-ready magenta. The mule slip-on style features a square toe, two supportive double-braided straps, and a faux alligator textured block heel that one reviewer deemed “so easy to walk in.” The thick 3.25-inch round heel offers more support than a stiletto, making them comfier and easier to stand on for longer periods of time. Although they’re an open-back style, the double straps offer more stability by holding the foot in place as opposed to the looser feeling that can occur with a single strap shoe.  The Basil Heeled Sandals received more than 690 five-star reviews, with many commenting on how comfy they are. Shoppers are highlighting that they’re wearable beyond just one event and are “perfect for anything casual or formal,” according to one person.“The height is perfect for capris, skirts, dresses, and jeans,” another reviewer mentioned, so you can wear them with low-lift outfits without feeling too over-the-top.  Numerous shoppers noted that they wore the heels to great lengths, leading them to purchase even more pairs. One shopper who normally doesn’t wear heels said they “ had them on for over five hours, and [their] feet never hurt.” Another shopper wore them practically all day, mentioning, “After 10 hours [of wear], I was still dancing.” The shopper was “shocked at how well these worked for the wedding” and added that their “feet didn’t hurt or get swollen.”  Target  Shop now: $35; target.com  You may want to take a cue from shoppers and grab multiple colors of the heels.

Many brides fantasize about walking down the aisle in a gown that looks like it belongs on the set of “Bridgerton” or “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.” This fantasy can now become a reality thanks to Allure Bridals’ new line of dresses. The premier wedding designer is collaborating with Shondaland to create gowns that are fit for a Queen herself … Queen Charlotte, that is.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Inspired by the sumptuous gowns in the Bridgerverse, these gowns will be a modern and wearable take on the dresses we drool over on “Bridgerton” and “Queen Charlotte.”  The Queen Charlotte gowns from Allure Bridals will be designed by none other than Shondaland’s Lyn Paolo. Paola has worked on many Shonda Rhimes’ projects, including “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Scandal,” and most recently served as Costume Designer for “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.”  “I love the worlds that [Shonda] creates and it is an absolute delight to fill those worlds with beautiful costumes,” Lyn Paolo, Shondaland’s creative director and designer, said in a press release. “Now I am excited to help design beautiful gowns inspired by the world she has created for today’s beautiful brides.”  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Though the collaboration shared Paolo’s sketches of the gowns ahead of their release, the Allure Bridals x Shondaland wedding gowns won’t be available until December 2023. The dresses are moderately priced, starting at around $1,600. (According to The Knot, the average wedding dress was $1,900 in 2022.) There are more luxe options in the Shondaland line that can range up to $3,000, so brides can find the dress that best suits their budget.  As you can see from the sketches of the gowns, these dresses bring the drama. Forget minimalism and austere design: These wedding dresses are designed with romance and royalty in mind.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  “The intricate details, lavish fabrics, and timeless elegance of Queen Charlotte and the ton’s fashion are a perfect fit for our bridal gowns, and we can’t wait to unveil this special collection to brides around the world,” says Kelly Crum, CEO of Allure Bridals.

Designed to tie in bridal attire with the ceremony aesthetic, this arrangement of florals brings a whimsical touch to the bride's aesthetic. Designers can get quite creative and create bouquets big and small for brides to walk down the aisle with that feature a wild melange of blooms or just a singular kind of flower. While the types of florals used within a bouquet can vary greatly, there are a few more popular blooms and filler flowers used in this wedding arrangement. However, these are usually accented with less common ones for intrigue.  ""Floral designers today strive for innovation, especially in the era of social media,"" shares floral designer Shean Matthew Strong. ""It is crucial to create floral art pieces that truly showcase their talent. As a designer, incorporating unique elements is always a safe bet. This could be as simple as including herbs like mint, rosemary, or lavender in a bouquet, or something more captivating like a Hellebore, anthurium, or garden roses.""  Meet the Expert Shean Matthew Strong is a wedding and event floral designer. He is the owner and founder of Shean Strong Design.  Want to learn what are the most popular florals found in the wedding bouquet? Read ahead to learn about standout blooms and filler flowers often used in this iconic arrangement.  Photo by Amy and Stuart Photography  Popular Bouquet Flowers  Larger flowers with structure and plenty of petals are often the primary florals you will find in a wedding bouquet. One of the most popular types of flowers used in all kinds of weddings arrangements are roses. Found in hues ranging from bright whites to light pinks to deep reds, a rose is a timeless wedding bloom that can help your bouquet tie into your palette. A commonly used alternative to this bloom is ranunculus. These florals can add texture and movement to a bouquet thanks to their ruffly petals.  Show-stopping peonies are just as popular as roses, thanks to their distinct colorful petals. However, this temperamental flower only really blooms from April to June, so just springtime couples can utilize them in their bouquet designs. Large dahlias are a popular alternative for couples who want this face flower from mid-summer through the fall. For a hardy bloom that can ground an arrangement, floral designers also like to turn to hydrangea.  Looking for a lighter floral with movement? ""When aiming for a bouquet with a delicate fragrance and captivating beauty, Japanese Sweet Pea is a perfect choice,"" notes Strong. ""Its gentle scent and flouncy petals form a soft and feminine shape that is both timeless and romantic."" Long-stemmed anemone are fun to incorporate for a modern bouquet, while orchids are popular if a bride wants to create a cascading bouquet.  Certain flowers are more common in bouquets of a single variety. Calla lilies are an elegant, trumpet-shaped bloom often found solo and tied with a beautiful ribbon for a bridal accessory. Lily of the valley is also popular for this style of arrangement.  Photo by Lucy Cuneo  Popular Filler Flowers  While certain blooms stand out as the face flowers of a bouquet, other florals and greenery are incorporated to add dimension to these arrangements. In fact, some of these blooms can be the star of the show. ""A flower that is often underrated but can add depth and movement to arrangements is the lisianthus,"" says Strong. ""When used skillfully, the color variations in its petals allow this once-considered 'filler flower' to take on the role of a 'dancing flower,' bringing the much desired sense of movement to bouquets.""  Another popular wedding filler flower of the moment is baby's breath. With light white blooms and plenty of volume, baby's breath is commonly used throughout wedding arrangements. While normally a filler, you can find modern brides and bridesmaids carrying bouquets of this flower on its own.  For smaller blooms, carnations are commonly used as accents to a bouquet. Since they are available year-round and are quite durable, they are a safe bet to include in your arrangement. Spray roses are also a nice addition when looking for a petite floral.  ""Don't hesitate to experiment with unique textures,"" advises Strong. ""Eucalyptus can provide interesting colors and shapes, clematis adds a touch of garden charm, dates create a cascading effect, and hyacinths offer a cluster of texture and color. Embracing a variety of flowers can elevate the overall appeal of your floral designs.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vcG9wdWxhci1mbG93ZXJzLXVzZWQtd2VkZGluZy1ib3VxdWV0cy03NDk4NTU40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Gomez and the beautiful Grande tied the knot in an exclusive ceremony in their Montecito home on May 15, 2021.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.  “Ask Anna” is a sex column. Because of the nature of the topic, some columns contain language some readers may find graphic.  Dear Anna,  Advertisement  I’m currently planning my wedding to the wonderful man of my dreams. The process itself is less than thrilling but we’re working together as a team to tackle all the little logistical things and hurdles. A problem that I didn’t anticipate, however, is the feelings I’m having when people RSVP no — in particular, only one person from my family is coming, my sister. I love that I’ll be surrounded by friends on my big day, but I can’t help but feel hurt that my family, who I thought would show up for me, isn’t coming. I’ve certainly been invited to weddings that I wasn’t able to attend for financial or scheduling or COVID reasons, so I know it’s likely not personal, but it feels personal. How can I deal with this and focus on what truly matters — that I’m going to celebrate the love of my life? — Being Rigid In Demanding Expectations  Dear BRIDE,  Advertisement  First off, congrats on snagging the man of your dreams! It’s not everyday that you find someone worth spending your life with, so big ups to you two — I wish you every happiness.  It’s totally valid to feel hurt that people you care about can’t make it to your big day. Weddings are, in many ways, extremely loaded events and we attach way more meaning, disappointment and weight than they deserve. That’s not your fault — society tells us that this one day is THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF OUR LIVES. How can we not fall short of such a ridiculous ideal? (We can’t.)  And, really, it’s just a party. A very expensive party.  Remember also that weddings are a giant, love-fueled jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes the pieces just don’t fit perfectly for everyone. (Sometimes not even for you.)  So, how do you deal with the hurt feelings without letting it hinder the love fest that awaits you and your future spouse? Here are a few tips:  Allow yourself to grieve: Let yourself feel all the things you’re feeling. Whether you’re hurt, pissed off, depressed or perhaps all of those things at once, the fastest way to deal with feelings is to simply feel them. Don’t push them away or shove them down. Open yourself to the pain, let it core and dismantle you. Then, once the storm has finished raging inside of you, dust yourself off and keep going. Feelings are always temporary. They pass. Remembering that will help you when you’re feeling the lowest lows.  Something that helped me when I was grieving the death of my father (admittedly somewhat different than your conundrum but not entirely) was to set aside five minutes a day, in the morning usually, to just think about him. Sometimes I would journal but usually I would just ugly-cry. When I allowed myself the space to feel the full weight and depth of my agony, I was surprised at how quickly the feelings moved on. Eventually, I only had to do the ritual every other day, then once a week, and now I do it only very occasionally, on his birthday and death day. You might try a similar ritual to feel the pain and disappointment you’re experiencing around your family.  Embrace the sisterly love: Then, practice a little gratitude for the family that is coming. Your sister’s got your back and will be there to celebrate with you. That’s not nothing. Plus, you two can bond even more during this special time, which will make your relationship closer.  Advertisement  Remember other ways your fam has shown up for you: When I’m feeling especially disappointed by someone who’s important to me — and literally everyone is disappointed by their families at some point! — I try to remember all the other ways they’ve shown up for me in the past, whether it was offering encouragement, sharing time or space with me, buying a book, being there for me during a hard time or even giving me cash when I desperately needed it.  People show their love in vastly different ways at vastly different times — love isn’t a one-and-done thing. It moves. So, while it stings that this particular time certain people can’t show up for you, it doesn’t mean they never have or never will again.  It’s not you, it’s them: As you said yourself, people have their reasons for not attending, and most of the time, it has nothing to do with you. Life gets in the way, and that’s OK. Just remember that their absence doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. Tell yourself a better story.  Quality over quantity: Spend a little time fixating on the amazing friends and loved ones who are coming to your wedding. They’re the ones who’ll be dancing the night away with you, toasting with you and sharing in all your wedded bliss. That’s worth celebrating.  In queer parlance, we call them chosen family — they’re our ride-or-dies, they show up for us in the middle of the night, they bring us food when we’re sick, they read and edit our sexts, they love us unequivocally when our family or society has rejected us because of who we love or who we are. It’s a bond more powerful than blood because it’s a choice. A daily, intentional f— yes! Honor those people in your life. Let them be your family.  Virtual love: If some family members can’t physically be there, you could also consider setting up a livestream or video chat to include them in the festivities. That way, they can still share in the joy of your big day.  Advertisement  Keep perspective: At the end of the day, your wedding is a celebration of the love between you and your soon-to-be spouse.

"wedding","2021-11-06","Not Discerned","{""NewOrleans"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:10:00","On Matalin ""Matty"" Carville's very first day of work at New Orleans City Hall, she met the man she was meant to be with; but it happened to be his last day of work there. Luckily, she later reconnected with Sam Joel at a co-worker’s going away party. Or, maybe it wasn’t luck. “A psychic had predicted this meeting, in detail, to me,” Matty shares. The psychic also told her that Matty and her soulmate had been split from the same atom and met countless times before in previous lifetimes. This lifetime was to become the one they'd got married in.  Even though she certainly knew Sam was the one, Matty didn't know the proposal was coming. “Sam is a master of surprise,” she says. “We got engaged on the rooftop garden of Sam’s cherished grandmother’s Midtown apartment in October 2018. Sam’s dad, a professional photographer, was waiting in the wings to capture the moment. When we walked back into the apartment, Sam had invited an intimate circle of family and friends to surprise me.” They celebrated with a custom menu at one of Matty’s favorite restaurants.  When it came to wedding planning, they started with what they didn’t want. “In our first meeting, I told planner Allison Jackson how important it was for our guests to feel comfortable,” Matty recalls. “I wrote out a list of everything I ever hated about going to weddings, and asked her if we could eliminate or improve on as many of those things as possible. I wanted the vibe to be Friday night at your favorite bar in New Orleans—but in the mountains. I love the aesthetic of Jack Rose, a restaurant in the Pontchartrain Hotel in New Orleans, so that’s where we had our meeting.”  The venue, at least, was a no-brainer. “The Matalin-Carville family farm—built in 1753, and bought by Matty’s parents six months before Matty was born—is where Matty and her sister spent their early years,” the couple shares. “It’s where they always gathered for the most important and special events in their lives.” The bride's wedding would be no different. From there, the couple pegged vendors who matched their creativity and enthusiasm for doing something unexpected. “We wanted to think really out-of-the-box and have a lot of fun,” they say. Of course, nods to their psychic-predicted meeting and soulmate status were woven into the celebration.  Read on to see all the playfully unique details of Matty and Sam’s November 6, 2021, wedding day, planned by Allison Jackson of Pineapple Productions and photographed by Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The palette was pulled from “colors of nature, autumnal jewel tones, and a variety of textures,” Matty says. “We love bird watching together in Audubon Park in New Orleans, so we incorporated a bird motif throughout.”  While this lead to a beautiful invitation design, getting them to guests was a challenge. They changed their date due to the pandemic, then the new invites were shipped during hurricane season in Louisiana, where many of their 250 guests reside. “Our invitation send-out unfortunately coincided with Hurricane Ida, so everyone’s mail was disrupted and many were evacuated for long periods of time. Some folks’ hard copy of the invitation arrived a month after our wedding,” Matty says. “To all future brides, I would recommend the practice of perspective and laughing at the things you just can’t control.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much, and that their presence at our wedding means so much.  Photo by Kate Headley  The personalized touches was endless, and the couple took on quite a few DIYs. “The best example would be our guest goody bags,” they say. ""We had fun cups made with our name and date; gave out copies of Matty’s grandmother’s cookbook; and even had T-shirts made that said, ‘Someone in the Shenandoah Valley Loves Me.’ Was it cheesy? Sure. Did we care? Hell no! We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much. We know things have been difficult for everyone and their presence at our wedding means that much more because of it.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  For her bridal attire, Matty paired a crepe Sarah Seven gown with an overskirt by Alexandra Grecco. “I had long been a fan of Sarah Seven; all her gowns are so chic,” the bride says. ""It was the first one I tried on, and my heart knew immediately. I paired it with the overskirt at the suggestion of my sister—the most stylish person I know—and I fell in love with the combo. The other key was trying it on with the cathedral-length veil. I also wore a bow from my mother’s wedding gown, which she hand-sewed onto the back of my skirt.”  Matty's makeup look was effortlessly beautiful, with hair was inspired by her mother. “My mom wore a Vera Wang headband on her wedding day, and I wanted to mirror that with a white headband that I had [our florist] decorate with fresh flowers,” Matty says. “It felt really glam and fun, and my hair was out of my face so I could dance all night.”  Photo by Kate Headley  “The best, best accessory was the homemade flower crowns my cousin made for all the kids,” Matty shares. “Her daughter was one of our flower girls, and she was sure to model it like a pro and show the other kids how to wear it with enthusiasm. We also had cute little signs for our kiddos to wear down the aisle—things like, ‘I’m just here for the cake!’ and ‘Has anyone seen the rings?’ It added levity and humor in a serious moment.”  Photo by Kate Headley  As guests entered the ceremony space, they were greeted with warm spiked local apple cider and savory parmesan rosemary shortbread. “The focal point of our ceremony decor was the floating chuppah, which was designed by Amaryllis Floral & Event Design. The die-cut wood chuppah frame was suspended from the poles of our sailcloth tent,” Matty describes. ""The corners of the chuppah were adorned with silk ribbons. During our ceremony, special friends and family members pinned photos of lost loved ones to the ribbons.” To make the event more intimate and inclusive, they set their ceremony in the round.  Photo by Kate Headley  Matty’s dad, James Carville—a well-known political strategist, commentator, and author—walked her down the aisle to the sounds of “Stand by Me” strummed by a string quartet. Her mother, meanwhile, looked very chic in pink. “She wore a Carolina Herrera dress and accessorized it with an Oscar de la Renta boa and vintage Givenchy opera coat,” Matty says. “She also carried a small posy of roses and dahlias, accented with peacock feathers, a symbol of good luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  There was no first look, as the bride and groom wanted to see each ofter for the first time at the ends of the aisle. “It was amazing,” Matty shares. “I got the teary-eyed photo of Sam under the chuppah that I always wanted!” During the ceremony, “I loved sharing our Jewish faith traditions with Matty’s Catholic family, and I loved that they loved it,” Sam says. “I’m also so glad we wrote our own vows. We really said everything we needed to say [and] made promises we’re excited to keep. To me, that’s the best way to start life together.”  Guests tossed birdseed and confetti at the newlyweds as they retreated down the aisle. “Our recessional was a traditional hymn, but it morphed into ‘Jambalaya (On the Bayou)’ by Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ray Charles, which my dad arranged as a surprise on our wedding day,” Matty says. “Guests were dancing down the aisle as they made their way out of the tent to the cocktail hour.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  The newlyweds traversed the property to enjoy the first few moments as husband and wife, and took portraits with their photographer Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “An oversized wooden wagon held candles and soaps my mother made in the months leading up to our wedding day for each guest,” Matty says. Guests filled swag bags and snapped photos in a vintage trailer during cocktail hour, while a Cajun zydeco band created a festive atmosphere. “We had a variety of signature cocktails inspired by our family and friends,” Matty says. “We clipped fortunes to cocktails and served them with tarot card coasters as a fun nod to our psychic-predicted meeting.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We melded NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of the Shenandoah Valley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The reception tent decor was inspired by Jack Rose, the New Orleans restaurant where they’d had that first meeting with their planner. “Allison suggested we approach the design by melding NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley,” Matty says. “Our tent was draped in rich textured peacock-blue fabric and finished at the top with a patterned valance. Wrought-iron and gold-leaf lanterns with pillar candles, Southern smilax, and dripping jewel-toned flowers filled the ceiling of the tent for a whimsical and lush look.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “A large oval mahogany bar featured decorative panels with a bold coordinating print,” Matty continues. “The center of the bar housed a large shelving unit filled with botanicals and curiosities—even a peacock, which is a known omen foretelling success and luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  The bandstand was created from a wooden wall painted brick red and decorated with disco balls and a neon sign reading “You Belong Here.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Their semi-naked cake was adorned with sugar flowers, fresh figs, and Seckel pears—and there were more treats, as well. “Our groom’s cake was a delicious loaf of challah surrounded by honeycomb and fresh figs. Southern sweets like Mississippi mud bars and lemon squares rounded out the dessert menu.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Dinner was an homage to New Orleans. “Roasted outside our tent in an antique trailer, traditional cajun-style whole suckling pig was served at a butcher-block table with local apple chutney,” Matty says. There was also jambalaya, New Orleans roast beef debris, and blackened redfish. The couple even served a famous salad recipe pulled from the Carville family cookbook.  Photo by Kate Headley  The duo had their first dance to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” then the party got going. “Reaching out for Sam’s hand and looking over the crowd together when we were lifted up for the hora, I thanked my lucky stars for the health and presence of everyone there,” Matty shares of her most cherished moment from the day. “I tried to just melt into the blessings around me.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Fireworks erupted as a surprise grand finale to the evening, while chicken sliders and paper cones of tater tots were passed around. Looking back on the day, Matty has some advice for other to-be-weds. “Be bold, lead with kindness, politely ask for what you want, and cultivate your own style and infuse that into your wedding in a way that genuinely celebrates the love you have for your partner, your family, and your guests,” she says. “Also, trust the professionals—you’ll be blown away by their creativity.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vdmlyZ2luaWEtZmFybS13ZWRkaW5nLXRhcm90LWJvbGQtcGFsZXR0ZS03NDk3NTY40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Dolores"", ""Peten"", ""Guatemala""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:11:43","The real reason Melissa and Joe Gorga skipped Teresa Giudice and Louie Ruelas' wedding has finally been revealed, and it's more sinister than you think!  All was made clear on the season 13 finale of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Tuesday, which saw Melissa share the ""big secret"" she said she's been keeping to herself the last six months.  Opening up the morning after the finale party, Melissa said that it all started with the rumor that Melissa was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband in the backseat of a car.  ""For the last six months, I've been trying to keep this big secret, because I was doing everything in my power to keep the family together,"" Melissa says.  ""I didn't want to say anything, because I was scared that they were going to ruin my wedding,"" Teresa goes on to claim.  The episode then flashes back to the night of Dolores Catania's Irish-themed, 1920s ""prohibition"" party, where everything came to a head.  Danielle Cabral breaks the news to Melissa that Margaret Josephs' former friend, Laura Jensen, told Jennifer Aydin and Teresa that Margaret has dirt on Melissa, claiming she was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband. It's then that Melissa stops Danielle and tells her she's already heard this story... from her own husband.  ""You wanna know how I heard it through my husband? 'Cause his sister called him over to her house secretly without me to tell him this story behind my back. Pretty f**ked up sister-in-law I have, isn't it?"" Melissa fires back.  The longtime RHONJ star proceeded to break things down in a confessional, calling the rumor ""baseless.""  ""Six months ago, Teresa called Joe over with Louie, because she heard a rumor about me, and she believes it so much, that she had to call her brother over. How dare you tell my husband that I would cheat on him?"" Melissa asks. ""You're saying this off a baseless rumor, from some woman who wants to hurt Margaret with no facts. No anything. Did she think he was just going to pack his bags and leave? Like, what the f**k are you doing?""  Fired up and frustrated at this point, Melissa tells Danielle that she should've called both Melissa and Teresa over to have this conversation. Danielle is confused by Melissa's claim that Teresa would want the cheating rumor to be true -- it becomes clear then that maybe Danielle isn't too well-versed in the years-long back-and-forth between Melissa and her sister-in-law.  ""Are you kidding me? Doll face, look at me. I have been accused of being a stripper. I have been accused of doing stuff in parking lots before,"" Melissa says. ""She's said multiple times, 'Your wife will leave you for a richer man.' She's said multiple things that we have let go in our life.""  Melissa shares that she had no intention of confronting Teresa about the meeting or the rumor because Joe himself doesn't believe it.  ""It's bulls**t and because I wanted to let her have a peaceful six months leading up to her wedding,"" Melissa says in a confessional. ""And look what ends up happening: she has her minion make me look bad in front of everyone, so everyone can hear the words 'Melissa's a cheater,' and I am done.""  Demanding to know why Teresa called Joe to the house to tell him about the alleged cheating, Melissa asks her sister-in-law for an explanation.  ""First of all, it wasn't his sister. It was Louie. He was like, 'I wanna tell your brother that all this is coming from Margaret, so your brother can get in front of it,'"" Teresa claims in a confessional. ""So, he was looking out for my brother. And I never repeated it to anymore.""  At this point, the entire party is heated, with fights breaking out amongst nearly everyone on the cast. The group begins to separate into their couples as they unpack what just happened. After getting the play-by-play from Melissa, Joe sets things straight in a confessional.  ""I get a call from Louie, 'What are ya doin'? I need to see you right away. It's very important.' So, I go to her house and Louie says, 'We heard that Melissa cheated on you.' I go, 'Guys, you got the wrong girl,'"" Joe tells the cameras.  Melissa starts to believe the altercation was all a set-up and tells the cameras that she thinks Teresa knew Danielle was going to tell her at the party.  After more back-and-forth and a heated argument between Joe and Louie, the group disbands, with everyone starting to make their way home for the night.  It's now the morning after the party and Melissa calls Dolores to go over the night's events, it's then she shares that she and Joe won't be going to Teresa and Louie's wedding.  ""Dolores, how can I go and celebrate someone else's marriage when they are the people that are constantly trying to destroy mine?"" Melissa says. ""I'm not doing it.""  Dolores tells Melissa if they don't go to the wedding, then she and Joe's relationship with Teresa is ""over-over,"" to which Melissa replies, ""It's been over.""  Already on the way to Teresa's house, Dolores tells Melissa that she plans to tell Teresa about her decision to skip the wedding. And she does just that, breaking the news to the couple, who are just days away from getting married.  ""They hate us,"" Teresa says after finding out about Melissa's decision. ""Obviously, they're not happy for us... This has been going on over 10 years. I dealt with it with my ex, I'm not going to deal with it in my new chapter of my life. I'm so done.""  Later in a confessional, Teresa says that she doesn't want a family ""like that,"" if this is the way things are going to be.  ""I know she's been wanting to get my brother away from me all this time,"" Teresa says of Melissa. ""She got her wish. She got her wish.""  The season ends with Melissa and Teresa in a worse place than viewers have seen them to date, signaling that things between this family may really be ""over-over.""

"wedding","1761-10-14","Not Discerned","{""Bridgeton"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:09:28","Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story opens with a disclaimer. “This is the story of Queen Charlotte from Bridgerton,” the soothing voice of Julie Andrews reads as the text appears onscreen. That is to say: It is not the story of the real Queen Charlotte. “It is not a history lesson,” the statement continues. “It is fiction inspired by fact. All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional.” And while that is certainly the case—no one can truly know what went on in Charlotte and King George III’s relationship—some parts of the show actually are true to life. This is particularly the case when it comes to Queen Charlotte’s wedding.  Queen Charlotte shows a 17-year-old Princess Charlotte being quickly married off to a 22-year-old King George, leaving her home in Germany and getting married the same day she arrived. That all actually happened. Here are some more details about the real royal wedding as they compare to the hit Netflix show.  Charlotte’s journey to England was pretty accurately depicted.  On the show, British royal representatives arrive in Mirow, the dukedom in northern Germany where Charlotte lived as Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her brother, Adolphus, signs the contract for Charlotte to marry King George III. Adolphus then makes the journey to England with Charlotte.  This is all true to life, but some details were missing. The official British royal family website explains that the escorts who arrived in Germany to collect Charlotte were led by the Earl of Harcourt. According to the site, the group didn’t leave right away. Instead, they were three days of celebrations, and then they returned to England with Charlotte where she would begin her new life.    While Queen Charlotte shows the future queen complaining of her uncomfortable outfit and whale bone corset, the journey was actually hard for a different reason. The royal family site notes that the voyage was difficult and the group faced three storms while crossing the North Sea. It also was a very long trip: They left Germany on August 17 and didn’t get to London until September 8.  While Charlotte and Adolphus are traveling, he mentions that their parents have died. This was also true, and the death of their mother was very recent—she had died only three months earlier.  Charlotte got married the same day she arrived.  Queen Charlotte shows Charlotte and George getting married the same day that she arrives in England. And as surprising as it may seem, this is what actually happened.  “At 9:00 p.m. the same evening, within six hours of arrival, the wedding of Princess Charlotte and King George III took place at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace,” the royal family site reads.  The show features a confrontation on the wedding day between Charlotte and George’s mother, Princess Augusta, in which they argue about Charlotte’s wedding dress—she wants to wear the one she had made in Paris; Augusta wants her to wear an English-style dress. According to the Washington Post, the real George had requested that gowns be made for Charlotte and be ready when she arrived.  According to Percy Fitzgerald’s book, The Good Queen Charlotte (per Town & Country), for her wedding Charlotte “wore ‘an endless mantle’ of rich violet and purple velvet, lined with ermine, over a white satin and silver dress.” In the show, she does wear a silver and white gown—just without the purple velvet addition.  As for what wasn’t based on history...  A key part of the show is the fact that Charlotte is Black and the royal court becomes integrated thanks to her becoming queen. In reality, while there has been speculation that Charlotte had African ancestry, most historians agree that this idea lacks evidence and isn’t accurate. Instead, the show takes this idea and runs with it, which makes for an interesting story, but it means that the real wedding didn’t actually feature all the non-white members of the ton being invited to the royal wedding at the last minute.  As for other exaggerated or made-up moments, those are probably pretty obvious. Did Charlotte actually try to escape her fate as the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by climbing over a fence? Probably not, but it did make for a charming royal meet-cute with Farmer George.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90di9hNDM5MDcwMjEvcXVlZW4tY2hhcmxvdHRlLXdlZGRpbmctdHJ1ZS1zdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 28-year-old heir to the throne is set to wed fiancée Rajwa Al-Saif on June 1, and one guest has already given a hint about the dress code. According to Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman, Queen Azizah of Malaysia confirmed that she and her husband, King Abdullah, are attending the wedding, where the attire will be ""more like black tie, long dress but no tiaras..."" Salman tweeted on Monday.  It remains to be seen if the bride will sport a tiara on her big day.

"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:27:18","A groom revealed at the altar that his bride’s engagement ring contains more than just a dazzling diamond but also pieces of her very own DNA — and now, his dental confession is going viral.  Doctor and TikToker Justin Tyler Fox gained over 9.1 million views, 2.3 million likes and 20,000 comments when he uploaded the wedding day confession to his account.  However, while many wedding day videos go viral for rather upsetting reasons — like the bride who served her guests $48 bottles of antibloat pills at the reception, or the groom whose “disgusting” wedding vows set off red flags all across TikTok — Justin’s wedding day footage is making a positive impact on TikTok by touching people’s hearts (and raising the bar for vows from here on out).  Fox begins his viral vows by asking his bride, Raven, “Do you remember the day I knew for a fact I was going to marry you?” He then recalls the story for all their family and friends — and now, for all the TikTok viewers at home.  According to Justin, he decided to marry Raven after a very special hiking trip — and after her fateful fall attempting to follow him across a river.  When she took the nasty fall, he knew this was someone who would follow him to any place on earth, someone who would be by his side on every adventure and challenge.  Thus, to capture this very special moment, Justin secretly took a part of that day — and a part of Raven — and had it tucked away inside her ring.  Later, after proposing to Raven and putting the ring on her finger, she asked him, “What is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?”  Justin recalled explaining to her, “I told you, ‘No, that’s the way it’s supposed to be,’ and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day. Here’s my confession. That little stone in your ring is made out of dentine and enamel. When I picked it up that day, I went straight to the jeweler and I said, ‘Can you put this in my engagement ring?’”  Justin and Raven’s wedding guests were immediately moved by the story — as were millions of TikTokers, who begged for a video of his full wedding vows (a wish Justin later granted).  Over 20,000 TikTokers were deeply moved by Justin and Raven’s story, and their love.  “If his vows ain’t like this I don’t want him 🥹🤣,” laughed @ncsquared.  “This ladies and gentleman are wedding vows! This is love, a true testament of love, faith, God and laughter.♥️i wish y’all an eternity!” commented @ingridsshenanigans.  “these are the things that should be viral. pure genuine sentimental love. this is beautiful 💕,” wrote @lissmorales__.  While not every bride might appreciate having a tooth hidden inside their engagement ring, Justin’s unique custom ring captures their special love story — and will, hopefully, inspire partners everywhere to step up their vow and proposal game!

It’s wedding season, y’all. That means you’re going to have to pony up and buy that flight to that oddly remote destination your friend picked for their wedding two and a half hours from the nearest airport. Great venue choice, Bud!  For many people, wedding season can come as an embarrassing experience of wearing the same navy suit and tie you’ve had since high school graduation. Well, let me tell you, bro: It’s time to step up your game. Whether you’re going solo in hopes of meeting a bridesmaid or attending as a plus one to the event, you need to look your best. Fortunately, we’ve done the research to help you figure out what to wear as a plus-one to a wedding if you don’t want to look like every other person there.  Advice on Matching Your Date: If you’re going with a date, you should complement them, but avoid matching their look exactly—this isn’t your high school prom. If your date is wearing a certain color, choose accessories in similar or complementary shades or tones. For example, if your date is wearing a navy blue dress, opt for a different shade of blue, like sky or teal. If they are wearing pink or red, wear blue or green so that you complement each other but still look great when separated. And if they are wearing white, well then you wear whatever they told you to wear.  Try using a color wheel to match clothes and follow these few steps:  Choose one dominant color for your event outfit. Now, this could be a color that compliments your skin tone or just a color that you like to wear. Find the complementary color on a color wheel. This is the color opposite your dominant color on the wheel. Look for comparable colors on the color wheel. These could be the colors next to your dominant color or down the line in terms of shade. These analogous colors will help create a cohesive and harmonious look for your getup. Lastly, consider using neutral colors such as black, white, gray, or beige to balance out your outfit and leave room for small bits of flare.

The development speaks to an 872% increase in searches for handmade gifts on Etsy, indicative of a significant shift away from mass-produced items. The new platform, a game-changer for small businesses, is now live and accessible at Etsy.com/Registry.  What sets Etsy Registry apart is its support for independent creators and small businesses. It facilitates the selection of handmade, vintage, and personalized items, allowing couples to outline the precise customization they want. This makes Etsy a one-stop-shop for not only gifts, but also wedding decor and bridal party items.  Antoni Porowski, TV personality, and his fiancé Kevin Harrington have endorsed the platform, curating their own gift registry filled with unique items from worldwide makers. “One of the best parts about registering with Etsy is that you can choose custom, personalized gifts that never feel cookie cutter,” shares Antoni, hinting at the fun they had in curating their unique list of wedding items.  Alongside the launch of Etsy Registry, Etsy has also released its annual 2023 wedding trend guide. This year, couples are placing importance on fun and creativity, with unique twists on tradition taking center stage. Themes, elaborate programs, and unconventional bridal looks and rings are all part of the mix, adding to the excitement of saying “I do”.  Among the 2023 wedding trends identified by Etsy are Lovecore, Oversized florals, Western weddings, Love story gifts, and Rings with character. Lovecore sees an influx of heart patterns, roses, and red and pink hues, while Oversized florals incorporate rosettes and floral appliqués to add texture and romance. Western weddings bring a laid-back, unconventional style, and Love story gifts promote personalized mementos that celebrate each couple’s unique journey. Rings with character is a trend that showcases individuality, with handmade, unique rings gaining popularity over traditional designs.  For small businesses in the wedding industry, these trends provide a roadmap for product development and marketing. It opens avenues for those skilled in crafting handmade and personalized items, floral designs, or western-themed goods to tap into a growing market. Similarly, businesses specializing in love story gifts can hone their product range and marketing strategies based on the current trends, attracting more customers seeking unique, meaningful presents.  It’s important to note that this shift toward personalized and meaningful wedding items isn’t just a trend, but a sign of a larger movement towards conscious consumption. As consumers become more aware of their purchases’ impacts, they’re turning towards small businesses and independent creators who offer unique, handmade, and personalized items. The success of Etsy Registry could pave the way for a more diverse, personalized, and meaningful wedding gift industry, providing a significant boost to small businesses worldwide.  It’s clear that Etsy Registry is more than just a platform; it’s a statement on the future of the wedding industry. With its focus on personalization, creativity, and support for small businesses, Etsy is reshaping the way we think about wedding gifts and decor. And for small businesses, it’s an opportunity to connect with customers on a deeper level, offering products that are not only beautiful but meaningful as well.

"wedding","2023-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Fargo"", ""NorthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:14:00","FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Casey Ford and his fiance Allison Torkelson are set to get married in September, but never could they imagine they would be forced to find a new venue and caterer, just months before the wedding.  Ford says, last February, he and his soon-to-be wife coordinated with Bigfoot Bar and Grill, which was operated out of the Ramada Inn in Grand Forks, to plan their wedding. He says they wrote out a $1,400 deposit check to Bigfoot to secure catering and the use of the Ramada Inn banquet hall.  “They cashed it two to three weeks after that. Everything was fine. The communication was fine,” said Ford.  Although, everything did not turn out fine. Ford says he learned from social media that the business had closed.  “I found out on Facebook that they are splitting ways with Ramada. There was no communication there. I emailed them again saying, I found out through Facebook that you are splitting up. What’s the deal,” he said.  Ford says he learned of the closing through a posting on a Facebook group. The posting was from another soon-to-bride, who was having the same issue. Several screenshots were attached showing the woman’s many attempts to also contact Bigfoot to determine the fate of her wedding. The post accumulated more than 60 comments from others going through the same problem or those who have had less-than-desirable interactions with the business.  He also says there have been several attempts to contact Bigfoot’s owner since learning of the closure, but there has been little to no response.  “I’ve tried calling. I’ve tried emailing. My dad has been doing things on his end in Grand Forks to try and get in contact and we’ve just heard nothing.”  Not only was the couple out $1,400, they also had to find a new venue. All he wants now is to have the money refunded.  “It doesn’t feel good. $1,400 is a lot of money. That could go towards our wedding at the new place,” Ford said. “Having to find out through a third-party source that they are splitting and we don’t have a wedding. Don’t have a location and we had to go to other venues. That 1,400 would mean a lot.”  Google listed Bigfoot as permanently closed. Also, when visiting the business website, the word “closed” is plastered across the homepage.  According to an article from the Winnipeg Free Press, Bigfoot’s owner Ty Cox was facing deportation from Canada in 2014 after he allegedly scammed a charity for kids out of $7,200. It’s unclear if he was ever actually deported.  A representative from Ramada Inn confirmed Bigfoot was no longer operating in their hotel. The representative says they were not made aware of the full list of weddings scheduled. Although, they state the hotel will honor the commitment to host some weddings in certain situations.  If there are couples who have coordinated their weddings with Bigfoot and still wish to host their event at the Ramada, you can contact Assistant Manager Tiffany at (701) 203-1714.  Our requests for comment from the owner of Bigfoot Bar and Grill have gone unanswered.  Copyright 2023 KVLY.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Norway"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 14:09:36","Q:  My fiancée and I are putting together the guest list for our wedding and we’ve run into a social quandary. It will be a small wedding, and we want to invite two of our mutual friends who are married to each other. We mostly knew them as a monogamous couple, but since we moved to another state, they have become part of a polycule. We love our friends, and want everyone at this intimate gathering to feel comfortable. We’ve never met the two newest people in their relationship, but they all seem to be getting more serious about each other. Should we invite just the two friends, or the whole polycule? How do we know when a +1 should actually be a +2 or +3?  A:  Hello! Fellow queer person currently planning a wedding here and experiencing intermittent guest list stress, so I am answering from that perspective! The simplified version of my answer is this: Basically, you can treat these friends the same way as you treat other friends who have maybe started new relationships where you don’t know their partners. Are you automatically inviting all of your monogamously partnered friends’ partners even if you’ve never met them before or don’t really have your own friendships with them? Then it might be the most “fair” to consider inviting these friends’ partners. If you have left off some friend’s partners who you don’t know, then it’s fine to leave these ones off, too, regardless of how serious the relationship is.  My slightly more complicated (or perhaps liberating for you — idk!) answer is that you can invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. A lot of “guest list” etiquette is outdated when it comes to +1s — and I don’t mean in the sense that obviously old and heteronormative rules don’t take into account polycules or poly relationship structures but just in the sense that +1s in general don’t always need to be the default. Not everyone on the guest list for my wedding gets a +1 — even for some folks who are monogamously partnered! My fiancé and I basically went with our own personal “rules” for +1s, which weren’t codified rules at all but just rather who we thought it made the most sense to invite. We have some friends who are newer to our lives, and it just didn’t make a ton of sense for us to invite their partners who we’ve never met. We have some friends who we spend a ton of time with who never really bring their partners around, so in some of those cases, we also didn’t feel bad about not extending +1s. I have cousins in Norway who are invited who are married or otherwise in longterm partnerships whose partners are not invited, which I knew would be especially chill because Norwegians think Americans are kinda extra with all the +1 stuff at weddings.  The size of your guest list is the #1 determining factor for the cost of your wedding — full stop. I don’t think anyone understands this until they’ve planned a wedding themselves (myself included!), but the smallest adjustments to size can make a huge difference. It’s not “just a few extra people” in a lot of cases; it automatically makes the price of food, drink, programs, etc go up. And if you’re planning a small wedding, then it makes it all the more true that small fluctuations would have a big impact. The thing that really stands out to me is that you’ve never met these other people in the polycule. Except in a few very rare cases, my fiancé and I aren’t inviting anyone who hasn’t been met by at least one of us.  Every time I experienced stress while working on our guest list, I had a helpful friend who reminded me that there’s no way to make everyone happy; you should focus on making yourselves happy. No one should be invited to a wedding solely because you feel socially obligated to do so. You have to come up with whatever “rules” make the most sense for you — and they can be amorphous like ours ultimately were.  Of course, no one should feel excluded just because they choose a polyamorous approach to their relationships. Ask yourself this though: If these two people who you’re both friends with had recently broken up and were now seriously dating new people, would you invite those new partners? If any of your monogamous friends broke up and started seeing new people, would you invite those new people, too? If the answer is yes without a doubt, then sure, go ahead and invite their full polycule. If the answer is no or you’re unsure, then maybe remind yourselves that what really matters is the people you’re closest to are at your special day, and sometimes that doesn’t include everyone those people are also close to.  Also, something that’s helpful to keep in mind is that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with guest +1s being on, for lack of a better phrase, a “backup list.” If you have enough people decline when they RSVP to your wedding, then perhaps you can add in extra +1s — either for these friends or for other friends who are in new relationships or even for single friends who you think might benefit from a date. In general, my guest list has what I call a “no randos” policy, which basically means no blanket +1s for folks — except in a few individual cases where I know the person invited ONLY knows me and my fiancé and I wanted them to have a buddy. See, this is what I mean by amorphous rules! Be flexible and not overly constrained by etiquette, which can be super rigid!  I totally understand the impulse of wanting to make sure your approach to social expectations are inclusive and fair, but I also think it’s okay to play by your own rules when it comes to a wedding and go with your instincts. So long as the decision is being made from a place of what you actually want and not what you think others expect of you, I think whatever choice you make is ultimately yours and doesn’t have to be defended to anyone. The fact that you’re asking this question in the first place signals to me that you take your friends’ relationships seriously.  You can chime in with your advice in the comments and submit your own questions any time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9zdHJhZGRsZS5jb20vc2hvdWxkLWktaW52aXRlLW15LWZyaWVuZHMtd2hvbGUtcG9seWN1bGUtdG8tbXktd2VkZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Olivia Wilde broke the cardinal rule of dressing for a wedding when she attended Colton Underwood and Jordan C. Brown’s nuptials over the weekend.  The “Booksmart” director, 39, wore a silky, slinky white Nili Lotan gown ($1,895) to the couple’s marriage, and boldly showed off the very bridal style on her Instagram Story — along with an explanation.  “Wore a wedding dress to a wedding so I could make a joke about it in my toast,” Wilde wrote on top of a picture of herself in the backless design.  “The grooms approved,” she added.  The unconventional style choice still caused a stir on social media, with one person tweeting, “Olivia Wilde showing up to her friend’s wedding in a white silk wedding gown is… desperate.”  Wilde shared an Instagram Story with the two grooms. Olivia Wilde/Instagram  This isn’t Wilde’s only near-fashion faux pas this month.  Earlier this May, the “Don’t Worry Darling” director hit the 2023 Met Gala red carpet in a white Chloé dress that was strikingly similar to a black version worn by Vogue China’s editor-in-chief, Margaret Zhang, at the same event.  But Wilde took the matching moment in stride.  “Great minds 😎,” she captioned side-by-side shots of the pair on her Instagram Story. “If you’re gonna twin with anyone, make it @margaretzhang.”  The “Don’t Worry Darling” director also wore a white dress to the 2023 Met Gala.

The key to finding just the right look? Skip stilettos in favor of flat sandals and go for the best beach wedding guest dresses that are wearable and refined at once.  “Look for styles that are flowy, made with lightweight fabrics like linen and viscose to help to keep you cool, and that you can dance on the beach in all night,” Suzanne Smallshaw, senior director of fashion and styling at , tells Bazaar. “If you’re looking for a more form-fitting dress, opt for one with breathable stretch, so you’re comfortable from the afternoon ceremony to sunset cocktails.”  Don’t be afraid to lean into bold, bright designs. In fact, Smallshaw suggests looking to mood-boosting spring 2023 trends for inspiration. “Opt for vibrant colors, seasonal prints, and interesting details or cutouts to show off a little skin,” she says. “Playful pleats, sunset-inspired hues, and mermaid-esque silhouettes are top themes this summer that would also play wonderfully in a beach wedding setting.”  Attending a black-tie seaside ceremony? Try a floor-length slipdress in a bright graphic print. If the invite specifies semiformal or cocktail attire, go for a dreamy puff-sleeve maxi or an ornate lace mini with a slightly relaxed fit. To enhance the vibe of your beach-chic look, Smallshaw suggests adding timeless, beachy touches like straw bags, gold jewelry, and pearls.  Whether you’re staying local or traveling to faraway shores, I did the research and tapped Smallshaw’s expertise to find the 25 best beach wedding guest dresses for every kind of seaside ceremony. Now, all that’s left to do is enjoy the salty breeze on your skin and bask in the sunshine.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuY29tL2Zhc2hpb24vdHJlbmRzL2c0Mzg0MTcxMS9iZXN0LWJlYWNoLXdlZGRpbmctZ3Vlc3QtZHJlc3Nlcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Each day this week, we’ll be asking our resident “Wediquette” expert and “Let Them Eat Cake” editor Melanie Spencer a frequently asked question or one from a reader.  Yesterday, we started the week off with a topic that can be tricky to navigate for many – money. Click here to see if there is a minimum amount to spend on a wedding present.  Today, we’re covering a big fashion pet peeve of ours surrounding wedding guests.  Question: How much is too much white in a wedding outfit? Can I wear white shoes/white purse/accessories?  Answer: It’s OK if an outfit has some white in it. What we want to avoid is attire that’s more white than any other color. So, for example, a blue dress with white flowers is fine. But it would be best to avoid a white dress with blue flowers. This guideline is mainly about steering clear of upstaging the couple getting married, since traditionally at least one person often wears a white dress, pantsuit or what have you. When it comes to accessories, I would err on the side of no white (for shoes and purse especially), because if one or more person in the betrothed couple is wearing white, they will likely also use white accessories and, again, it’s best to avoid anything that could smack of upstaging. All of this being said, if the couple instructs guests to wear white (or any specific color), definitely do as they request, because they are clearly going for a look and a vibe and you don’t want to be ‘that guy’.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bmV3b3JsZWFucy5jb20vd2VkaXF1ZXR0ZS13ZWVrLWhvdy1tdWNoLWlzLXRvby1tdWNoLXdoaXRlLWluLWEtd2VkZGluZy1vdXRmaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Focus on what you want to use and see every day.  Much conversation surrounds the wedding itself — the prep and planning for the Big Day and the related festivities are the topics du jour as couples consider the various elements of their union. But the wedding is the start of something new, and there should be some careful consideration of your life at home — whether it’s what items to register for or how to “marry” interior design aesthetics.  Whether you move in together before or after “I do,” you’re bound to have too much of one thing, too little of another — and some items that have to go. “Taking both aesthetics and blending them together is important,” says Maureen Block, of Mason Grey Interiors in Newtown Square. “This is a new space that should reflect both personalities. Everyone should feel comfortable at home.” Here are Block’s tricks for settling in.  If you’re looking for more planning advice, check out our guides to nontraditional bouquets, stocking an N/A wedding bar, managing wedding stress, budgeting, size-inclusive wedding attire, and more.  1. Take inventory of everything. Knowing what you both have helps you see what you may need.  2. Know what the long-term shared goal for each area is. Making and agreeing on a plan to proceed room by room or space by space is key.  3. Set a budget, and don’t be afraid of using a designer. It’s an investment, but it can help save time and money in the long run. But remember, communication in any relationship is key — especially  with your designer.  4. Consider your non-negotiables. Maybe it’s an oversize recliner that one of you must have but the other hates. Rather than arguing, design around it with great pillows or art pieces to draw the eye away.  5. When it comes to your registry, only bring into your home what you really love. Focus on the pieces you want to use and see every day.  What’s the Best Registry For …  COZY-CHIC HOUSEWARES?  Head to Anthropologie in Rittenhouse. The store’s eclectic lineup of bedding and functional but fun cookware often gets overlooked for its clothing selection, but who doesn’t need a cake stand shaped like a lily pad?  CONSCIOUS ART?  Try South Kensington nonprofit InLiquid. The organization’s new registry­ lets couples curate a selection of pieces from Philly artists at a variety of price points and styles. (Email Sara Zimmerman at saraz@inliquid.org to register.)  GIFTS FROM A GROUP?  Best for a couple that already has a home full of practical items — Ilyan Jewelry in Haverford has plenty of sparkle. Perhaps your wedding party wants to go in on a chic charm to commemorate the day.

However, one woman said she pulled off her perfect day at a great price by hiring an unlikely caterer: Chili’s.  In a viral video, user @brideisapersonality explained how having Chili’s as her caterer saved her a ton of money.  “We served Chili’s at our wedding and this is how much we spent,” the TikToker began the video.  In the background, she holds a receipt that features what the total was and everything she served to guests, including chips and salsa, salad, egg rolls, cajun chicken pasta, chicken tenders, sliders.  “Our total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests,” she said. “This also includes five specialty meals that we did for people who were gluten-free, dairy-free, and can’t eat meat, and people who needed special items like no dairy, only seafood, etc.”  While the TikToker was thoroughly impressed with the price point for all of the food, she said she did run into unexpected hurdles. “We had to pick it up pretty early because we didn’t want to pay the delivery fees,” she continued.  The TikToker said her wedding day also fell on St. Patrick’s Day, and the restaurant prepared the food ahead of time to ensure the entire order could be fulfilled. This meant the food had to be rewarmed and set up by the bride, her family, and the servers she hired to wait on guests and help clean up.  “We had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be like cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking. My coordinator had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn’t really supposed to do,” the TikToker said. “That was just a lot more work than we had anticipated.”  Nonetheless, the TikToker said she was still happy with her choice.  “The food was amazing,” she concluded. “It was the perfect meal for our wedding.”  Her video was viewed over 1.3 million times. Some viewers criticized the bride for not simply having the food delivered and expecting her servers to do additional, unexpected labor. “I’m all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,” user @mars wrote. “You should have paid delivery.”  However, others applauded the bride’s decision to go with a cost-effective option that still makes guests happy.  “Normalize this,” a commenter wrote. “Weddings are so out of control! Such a great idea!”  “I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was Chili’s,” one user commented.  Chili’s also eventually chimed in with a simple comment on the bride’s video: “Iconic.”  The Daily Dot reached out to @brideisapersonality and Chili’s for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxpcy1jYXRlci13ZWRkaW5nL9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxpcy1jYXRlci13ZWRkaW5nLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  GLASTONBURY, Conn. — Spring is here and that means it’s officially wedding season.  The wedding industry is seeing a huge boost in business after the COVID-19 pandemic wrecked wedding plans for brides across the state.  Now venues are just catching up with their rescheduled weddings from the pandemic, and while life feels back to normal, the wedding industry has changed completely.  Before you say ""I do,"" you may find yourself as a bridesmaid instead of a bride.  ""We have more than we can handle, more than we could want, we turn people away but we give suggestions on where they can go,"" said Corrine Crocker-Luby, owner of the Tiffany Juliet House.  Finding a place to tie the knot is more stressful than ever before. Some brides are already booking into 2026.  Over at Glastonbury Hills Country Club, co-owner Frank Schroll said wedding dates are booking up years in advance.  ""We even get some brides that aren’t even engaged yet, they come out they know it's gonna happen soon and they want to do the leg work,"" said Schroll.  That leg work is harder than in years past.  All those pandemic-postponed ceremonies and receptions have backed up the bookings at venues around the country. All pieces and parts of the wedding industry are hoping brides and grooms have some flexibility.  ""We don’t want to hear brides have one date because more than likely it will already be taken,"" said Schroll.  That’s exactly what happened to Shannon Dolan.  ""I was thinking wedding planning starting about a year in advance was going to be fine but quickly we were learning some of the vendors were already booked,"" said Dolan.  Last summer, she found out “I do” is already planning to be said for every date for this October.  She decided on an unconventional approach to her big day. It's her own new booming business, the Mix and Mingle Mobile Bar. The drinks come to you, allowing brides to choose their wedding day in their favorite spot, on a budget. October it is for her big day, just with fewer guests than originally planned.  ""We’ve been to some weddings that are smaller guest counts and they’re some of the most fun weddings we’ve been to,"" said Dolan.  More weddings means post-pandemic love is in the air.  Back at the Tiffany Juliet House, owner Crocker-Luby has also been a wedding planner for more than two decades, now watching some relationships running right to the altar.  ""People are actually falling in love more after Covid and celebrating their union,"" said Crocker-Luby.  That means while it may be harder to lock down a time and place, couples are still celebrating their love, sometimes with just a big guest list cut.  ""After the pandemic people wanted to get together with their families so now we’re seeing a lot more intimate gatherings,"" said Tamie Myers, owner of Event Connoisseur Flowers and Gifts.  No matter the size, what’s a wedding with out flowers?  Myers' wedding business is, well, blooming.  ""Business is booming and people are looking to get back out there and have the interactions with their friends and family again,"" said Myers.  Brides and grooms are keeping the industry on its toes, trying to celebrate like normal is back in vogue.  ""I think we were cooped up too long for sure and it’s remembering what’s important in life and spending time with people you love,"" said Crocker-Luby.  Couples are finally surrounded again by family and friends, having their cake, and eating it too.  Lindsey Kane is a reporter at FOX61 News. She can be reached at Lkane@fox61.com.

"wedding","2023-12-01","14:00:00","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:28:40","Shopping for the perfect wedding present for wine lovers is no easy feat. Though wine on its own can make a great gift—especially if it means something unique to the couple—it’s nice to pair the bottle with something extra special. Fortunately, we’re here to help take some of the stress out of the gift-giving process with plenty of expert tips.  First, you’ll need to pick a great bottle of booze. “Giving a bottle from a vintage from the year the newlyweds met or got engaged is a fun idea and shows that you also pay attention to the milestones in their relationship,” says Janice Carnevale, event planner and wedding expert with Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C. “A custom case for them to open over several anniversaries would [also] be an incredibly thoughtful gift.”  Next, you’ll want to determine what else you plan to gift the guests of honor. “Most often, we see wine given as part of a wedding gift, often accompanied by a gift of cash or sometimes accompanied by wine glasses,” says Sara Bauleke, wedding planner and designer at Bella Notte in Washington, D.C.  But before you begin browsing, be sure to check the couple’s registry to see if they have listed any wine-centric items, suggests Carnevale. “They might have glassware, a [wine] opener or a chiller on their list, which would pair great with a bottle you pick for them,” she says.  Finally, as you search for the perfect wine-centric gift for the bride and groom-to-be, consider how much you want to shell out.  “Generally speaking, couples will expect gifts in various price ranges depending on their financial situation,” says Jacqueline Vizcaino founder of Tinted Events Design and Planning in Atlanta.  Cathy O’Connell, co-founder of COJ Events in La Quinta, California, recommends spending somewhere between $100 to $200 or more, but staying in the range of what you can afford. Remember, it’s the thought that counts. Also, keep in mind that this number can vary depending on how close you are to the couple.  Here, we break down some fantastic wedding gift ideas for wine lovers across an array of price points.  10 Best Wine Wedding Gifts  Personalized Vivid Decanter Any oenophile knows the importance of using a wine decanter.

Each of the two storage zones can be individually set to 46°F, 54°F or 61°F, depending on the type of wine (i.e., reds, whites, or roses). What’s more, the wine preserver and chiller simultaneously preserve, chill and vacuum seals already-open wine bottles so that they can be enjoyed for up to 10 days. And, thanks to its compact design, it can be easily stored on the couple’s kitchen counter for easy access to their favorite bottles. $399.00 Wine Enthusiast  L'Atelier du Vin Black Matte and Wood Lever Corkscrew Any drinker can benefit from having an extra corkscrew around the kitchen.

"wedding","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 10:04:59","It was a discreet wedding, with immediate family and a few other attendees. But, when a photograph of the happy couple and the details of the marriage were published, the union of the mayor of Araucária and his fifth wife became headline news in the city in the southern state of Paraná and, in a heartbeat, all over Brazil. The wedding led to controversy as it took place four days after the bride turned 16, the minimum age in Brazil to legally marry with the permission of family or a judge, and because the groom is 65 years old. Eyebrows were also raised when it became known that the day before the ceremony the alderman had given his future mother-in-law a position in City Hall, appointing her councilor for culture. Despite the half-century age difference between the couple, it was this act of nepotism that raised the most outrage.  But despite the singular elements of this particular union, it is far from an uncommon event in Brazil. Last year, Brazilian notaries registered 12,509 marriages in which at least one of the participants was aged 16 or 17. That equates to 34 teenage spouses per day, the vast majority of whom were female.  A photograph of the beaming couple as Kauane Rode Camargo places a wedding ring on Hissam Hussein Dehaini swiftly went viral. The mayor’s political party moved quickly to disown him. And, in the face of a public backlash against the appointment of his mother-in-law, he soon dismissed her, although he initially pointed to her 26 years’ experience in public service as proof of her credentials.  Almost a month after the marriage, the newlyweds remain the most talked-about subject among Araucária’s population of around 140,000. “As anywhere, there are people who are for and against it,” says E. T., who asks to be identified by his initials in order to speak freely. “But I have noticed that, because he is an excellent administrator, his supporters choose not to look at the negative side, that it [the marriage] is legal, but immoral. Many have congratulated them, and wished them good luck.”  E. T. knows Dehaini personally, but his wife only by sight. He points out that the mayor is a successful businessman with interests in hotels, gas stations and airline charters that have created many jobs locally (although E. T. also mentions Dehaini was arrested on suspicion of links to drug trafficking two decades ago, according to the website G1, part of the Globo group). In his personal life, he has been married on four other occasions and has 16 children. His current wife was a recent finalist in the Miss Araucária Teen 2022 pageant. Although it is a conservative city, Araucária also hosts a beauty contest for young girls in the style of the movie Little Miss Sunshine.  Hissam Hussein Dehaini and his 16-year-old wife Kauane Rode Camargo. RR SS  Perhaps the age difference between Dehaini and Camargo did not come as much of a shock because Brazil is well-accustomed to marriages between older men and much younger women. The political elite serve as an example: President Lula da Silva is 21 years older than his wife, Janja and his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, is 27 years older than his wife Michelle. The record, though, goes to Michel Temer, president from August 2016 to December 2018, who is 43 years older than his wife, Marcela, whom he met in 2002 when he was already a veteran politician, and she was a 19-year-old newly crowned miss.  The marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, while causing controversy, has served to renew the focus on child weddings in Brazil, which remains a widespread practice. But legal marriages performed before the relevant authorities are only the tip of the iceberg, says Ana Nery Lima, a gender specialist with the NGO Plan International, who says that “informal unions in Brazil are very normalized.” The United Nations estimates that 26% of Brazilian women live with a partner before they are 18, including 6% who are not even 15. “In Brazil, when people hear the expression child marriage, they usually think of child brides of nine or 10 years old in India, but they don’t think of people they know, such as that neighbor, that aunt or their grandmother, who got married at 14,” says Lima. “In the eyes of the United Nations, child marriage is a formal or informal union in which at least one of the parties is younger than 18.” In global terms, Brazil ranks fifth in the world in terms of child marriages, with 2.2 million people falling under this category. In percentage terms, however, it is not in the top 20 worldwide, a list headed by Niger where 76% of minors cohabit with a partner before the age of 18.  In Brazil, the main reasons for this phenomenon are socioeconomic and cultural. “When two minors marry, it is usually because she is pregnant and the family wants to protect the girl’s reputation. But there are also very poor families who have many children and who think: ‘Look, at least [in another family] she will have something to eat, clothes to wear,’” says Lima. “Then there is that deep-rooted, macho culture that young women are more attractive.” The specialist notes that in weddings involving minors aged 16 and 17, the age difference between the spouses is usually around 15 years, “and this means a very large inequality of power.”  Although there were still over 12,500 legal child marriages last year in Brazil, the number of such unions has fallen by 30% since 2019 when Congress reformed the Civil Code to ban marriage before the age of 16 altogether, thus closing a loophole that ultimately allowed an adult who had raped a minor to marry her instead of going to jail, while also denying her access to abortion care, which she is entitled to by law. Any sexual relationship with someone aged under 16, consensual or not, is a crime in Brazil and no child aged under 16 can marry, regardless of whether his or her family has blessed it or not. Lima says this is a step in the right direction, but Plan International is still fighting to make marriage before the age of 18 illegal.  Following the controversy over the marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, the Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation into the Araucária mayor’s wedding and accusations of nepotism. However, as his wife is a minor, the details of the case cannot be made public.

"wedding","2022-04-26","Not Discerned","{""IslamoradaVillageOfIslands"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:23:56","Model Kamila Hansen and Official Partners cofounder Oren Alexander’s relationship began the old-fashioned way—with a pickup line. “I was in Las Vegas on a girls’ trip when he approached me [in a hotel lobby] and asked if I was lost,” Kamila remembers of their meeting in 2018. “It was just like that.”  The two began dating soon afterwards, and Oren eventually proposed while they were on vacation in Aspen in August of 2022. “It happened on the balcony of the house we were staying in,” Kamila recalls. “It was very casual, and surprisingly, I had no idea.”  Their wedding took place the following April in Islamorada, Florida, and the couple worked with Blue Water Weddings to plan everything. “It felt like we were putting together the ultimate weekend on an island for our family and closest friends,” Kamila says. “Since the pandemic, our social circle has shrunken, so we knew that we wanted our wedding to be very intimate.” To that end, she and Oren hosted a large engagement party for over 350 people at their home in Miami during Art Basel, which meant they were able to get away with doing something smaller for the actual wedding.  Selecting the wedding dress was a particularly fun part of the process for Kamila, who, throughout her career as a model, has worn many. “I went to Galia Lahav for the first time and picked three different dresses,” she admits. “A week later, I went back and chose a completely different one. I just fell in love with it, and they were able to make it for me in less than a month. Record time! I’m so glad it worked out because I loved the dress and felt it was perfect for my beach wedding.”  The bride kept her jewelry pieces simple and befitting of the al fresco wedding location. She wore a classic diamond necklace, bracelet, and earrings all from Material Good. As for beauty, she worked with Lauren Hen for a sun-kissed look, and also kept her hair down to ensure it felt as natural as possible. “Less is always more,” Kamila says.  The ceremony started just after 6:30 p.m., and the service took place under a jaw-droppingly beautiful chuppah consisting of garden and spray roses, hanging amaranthus, larkspur, snapdragons, frilled lisianthus, and astrantia, all by Petal Productions. First, Oren’s older brother and his 87-year-old grandmother walked down the aisle, followed by his middle brother and his fiancée. Next, his twin brother with his wife and the couple’s niece made their way down the aisle, Oren and his both parents—and lastly, the bride was escorted by her parents, who flew in from Brazil.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3cva2FtaWxhLWhhbnNlbi1hbmQtb3Jlbi1hbGV4YW5kZXItd2VkZGluZ9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3cva2FtaWxhLWhhbnNlbi1hbmQtb3Jlbi1hbGV4YW5kZXItd2VkZGluZy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Aric Hutchinson and at least 100 mourners gathered on Saturday at Folly Beach — the same beach where he and Samantha Miller, 34, married just hours before the deadly crash — for a memorial in honor of his late wife, CBS affiliate WCSC of Charleston reported.  Hutchinson, who sat in a wheelchair on the shoreline at the memorial, told the local station he’s “feeling pretty good” as he recovers from his injuries. He suffered a brain injury and broken bones as a result of crash, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his mother to help cover the cost of medical fees and the burial for Miller.  “My body’s getting back to where I can manage, I guess,” Hutchinson told WCSC at the memorial. “It’s just as good as I can feel with the situation, but obviously, today and the outpouring of people was just amazing. I know Sam would love it.”  “I mean, she’s a beach girl, through and through,” he added. “We do walk here almost every morning, and this is her send-off for sure. She’s up there smiling for sure.”  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller. Family of Samantha Miller / AP  He and Miller had been leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart when the crash unfolded on April 28, The Associated Press reported.  A woman identified by police as Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, was accused of slamming into the back of the golf cart while allegedly driving while drunk and over twice the speed limit, according to an incident report.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm after the crash, according to online records, which show that she remains in police custody.  Two other people in the golf cart besides the groom were also injured, Andrew Gilreath, Folly Beach public safety department director told the AP. He added that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Komoroski was not physically injured in the crash, according to a news release from city officials.  A witness reported that Komoroski “was dazed and confused” at the scene and repeatedly said “I did nothing wrong” and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  That report also states that Komoroski told a sergeant on the scene that she had two drinks that night: a beer and a “tequila pineapple an hour ago or so.”  Samantha Miller's mother, Lisa Miller, told Fox News Digital that Komoroski ""chose to drink, get behind the wheel, and plow down my daughter.""  ""This is a conscious choice that a young lady made,"" Lisa Miller alleged.  Komoroski's attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in a statement released last week: “We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdXMtbmV3cy9odXNiYW5kLWJyaWRlLWtpbGxlZC13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LWNyYXNoLXNheXMtZmVlbGluZy1qdXN0LWdvb2QtY2FuLXRyLXJjbmE4NDYxNtIBKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmE4NDYxNg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:02:07","Just in time for the summer wedding season, Dia & Co is turning its attention to dressing brides, bridesmaids and their families and friends.  Dia & Co, which offers personal styling services and plus-size apparel, now has an online landing page called the Wedding Suite. The page, which went live last week, features 38 collections curated by Dia & Co stylists. These include “bride,” “wedding guest,” “mother of the bride and groom” and “beach wedding.” In total, the Wedding Suite contains 2,200 styles from 64 brands, including Carolina Herrera, Diane von Furstenberg, Ever-Pretty and Eloquii.  In addition to the newly-curated collections, Dia & Co launched a Wedding Styling Service for brides, bridesmaids, mothers of the bride and wedding guests. The service is free, and customers can go online to receive advice and feedback about styles and sizing. While it’s still early, the reaction to the styling service has been positive, the brand says. Dia & Co sells dresses directly via its website but also recommends certain vetted salons for those who want to design their gowns in person.  In general, the apparel market still has a long ways to go in terms of inclusion. It’s not uncommon for major retailers to start offering plus sizes, only to reduce or even eliminate offerings a couple of years later, citing cost issues or problems with demand. And while it’s true that several brands do sell plus-size wedding dresses — David’s Bridal and Anthropologie, for example — many of today’s dresses do not come in a variety of styles and silhouettes, which makes the process of finding the perfect dress even harder. In addition, as The Cut writes, bridal stores want to stock as many styles as possible, so they typically carry “as few samples as possible” for people to try on.  Nadia Boujarwah, who co-founded Dia & Co in 2015, told Modern Retail she wanted to launch the Wedding Suite after getting married 10 months ago. Finding a dress was extremely complicated, she said, as many of the boutiques she visited had few options in stock. One boutique in New York City told her she could only try on four dresses, while another asked her to just hold a dress up to her body and “see” if it would fit.  “The traditional bridal salon experience can really be very painful. For the most part, these are dresses that are made to fit very, very few women,” Boujarwah explained. “It was truly unbelievable to me how challenging it was… I got through my experience with a thick skin and a lot of help, but really came away from it feeling like there’s just so much better that we could be doing here. This is one of the last frontiers of inclusive fashion.”  The U.S. bridal wear market is a major industry, estimated to be worth $27 billion. Roughly 2.6 million couples got married in 2022, more than any year since 1984, the Wedding Report found.  Before launching the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co had a “pretty extensive” offering of wedding wear, Boujarwah said. However, it did not have true bride or bridesmaid collections, and everything was self-service. With the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co wanted “to really build out that offering of the true wedding bridal wardrobe for both our brides and an inclusive bridal party,” Boujarwah said.  For instance, while Dia & Co normally offers sizes 10 to 32, the bridesmaids’ dresses now go from sizes 0 to 40. All of Dia & Co’s Wedding Suite items come in a variety of styles, as well, with silhouettes as varied as A-line, flare, midi and floor length.  That plethora of options is crucial, Shafonne Myers, editor-in-chief of the plus-size bridal magazine Pretty Pear Bride, told Modern Retail. “So often you see style guides and selections based off of straight sizes, so to see inspiration that looks like us, it’s so refreshing and inspirational,” she said.  Gabriella Santaniello, founder of A Line Partners, explained that wedding dresses are typically sized smaller than everyday clothes, so a woman who is normally a size four in a regular dress would probably be a six or an eight in a wedding dress. However, very few salons have plus-sized samples on the rack, she explained, which throws the sizing difference off even more.  “A lot of these… brands say that they’re inclusive, but when you go to try on, there’s really nothing in your size,” Santaniello said. “So you end up squeezing yourself into a dress, if you can even do it… It’s just not a fun experience.”  Santaniello said she’s sure there’s “a cost involved” to produce plus-sized samples. “But also what would be the incremental business you’d get from it?” she asked. “Probably a lot, if a woman could come in and feel that she had a reasonable idea as to what she’d look like in the dress.”  Myers, a wedding and events planner, said there are more options now for plus-size brides than when she got married 19 years ago, But, she added, “not enough brands cater to the market.”  “In my opinion, it’s because we as a plus-size audience don’t demand it enough,” she said. “…I would love to see more of the plus-size demographic speaking up about what they want. The louder we can get as a community and demographic, the more of an impact we can have.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb2Rlcm5yZXRhaWwuY28vb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWxhc3QtZnJvbnRpZXJzLW9mLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1mYXNoaW9uLXdoeS1kaWEtY28taXMtbGF1bmNoaW5nLWEtcGx1cy1zaXplLXdlZGRpbmctc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Just as the early bird catches the worm, the DIY wedding couple saves more money for honeymoon piña coladas. So to help you soon-to-be-newlyweds, today we’re talking about the decoration ideas that leave you inspired to take on a project or two that could save you cash. Have you secretly dreamed of being a florist? Here’s your chance to show off your petal-arranging chops. Still have the handwriting of a fourth grader? Eh, maybe book a calligrapher. So that you know what’s even possible, we’ve rounded up 39 DIY wedding decorations ideas from industry insiders across the country.  But before we dive in, here are some general tips about decorating a wedding like a pro…  Is it cheaper to do your own wedding decor?  When it comes to wedding decor, one of the biggest expenses is flowers. If you’re able (and willing) to tackle those, savings can be substantial—potentially thousands of dollars. Joan Wyndrum O’Hear, founder and owner of Blooms By The Box in Watchung, New Jersey, suggests ordering wholesale flowers and inviting family and friends (like your wedding party) to help make bouquets and boutonnieres. “Create small affordable bouquets with big blooms such as hydrangeas, peonies, or football mums paired with lush greenery,” she says. “You’ll need fewer stems when you use bigger flowers. Also, go with leafy greenery for the boutonnieres.”  How can I decorate my wedding on my own?  Beyond a glue gun (though you’ll definitely need one of those too), high-tech DIY tools make it easier than ever to decorate your wedding. Investing in a single device, such as a cutting machine like the Silhouette Cameo, for example, can make it possible to craft a slew of different DIY projects. Custom cake toppers, T-shirts for your bridesmaids, wedding signs, and programs can all be made with the same machine.  Additionally, taking a class to learn a new DIY skill might make your wedding projects, dare we say, fun. Sign up for a flower-arranging class, a candle-making workshop, a paper crafting lesson, or a calligraphy tutorial.  How can I make a cheap wedding look expensive?  Your venue will play a major role in your wedding style. And if you choose a place with built-in decor or eye-catching surroundings, you can achieve an expensive look without spending a fortune to dress up a blank-slate banquet hall. Jacqueline Vizcaino, owner of Atlanta-based Tinted Events Design and Planning, recommends opting for an outdoor wedding. “Explore natural venues instead of traditional halls,” she says. “Look for places like open-air gardens or outdoor parks where you won’t have to rely on electricity as much. This will reduce your carbon footprint and create a gorgeous backdrop for all your photos.”  What are the best decorations to use for a wedding?  “It’s always great when you choose decor that can do double duty or, even better, triple duty,” says Jamie Chang, owner and destination wedding planner at Mango Muse Events in San Francisco. “For example, a small plant or bud vase can be decor, a favor, and a place card,” she says.

"wedding","2023-05-11","Not Discerned","{""BocaRaton"", ""Florida"", ""UnitedStates""}","Mon 15 May 2023 21:59:00","Sam Cutler, a health and nutrition creator, faced intense backlash for her wedding day food diary.  She sipped smoothies and distributed bloat pills, as commenters suggested she was promoting unhealthy eating.  Advertisement  On Thursday, health and nutrition influencer Sam Cutler shared a ""what I ate on my wedding day"" video on TikTok, which chronicled her fastidiously healthful wedding in Boca Raton earlier this month as a gluten and dairy-free bride.  The clip, which has been viewed 4.5 million times, has sparked fierce backlash on the app, with many commenters disgracing Cutler for what they believed was promoting unhealthy eating habits.  The video begins with Cutler, who creates content under the moniker The Fit Fatale, sipping two different smoothies and being fed a grain salad by her maid of honor in the makeup chair. At the party, she notes a bottle of Arrae bloat pills have been distributed to guests, and says her chocolate wedding cake is ""gluten, dairy, and sugar-free.""  Cutler, 31, told Insider she had no idea the video would cause such a stir, given how similar it is to the rest of her content. Commenters were not only offended — some seemed angry.  ""So you forced your ED on all your guests and bridesmaids,"" a commenter wrote. She's now being called ""an almond mom,"" a term popularized on TikTok to describe adults with restrictive eating habits, and her ceremony, ""an almond wedding.""  Advertisement  The comments were ""low, hurtful, and harmful,"" the influencer said  Roughly nine years ago, the Toronto resident quit her corporate job to become a creator. She began documenting her journey to ""rebuild"" her heath in the face of several issues that arose in her twenties, including chronic bloating and adult acne.  She also endured a serious fall from a pilates class.  ""I was bedridden for about three months and really dove into trying to heal my gut and my brain at the same time,"" she said.  Nevertheless, as the video blew up over the weekend, it resulted in a spew of what Cutler called ""bullying and harassment.""  Many top commenters argued that a wedding marks a prime opportunity for indulgence and that Cutler was depriving her guests. Some went as far to say that she would be a terrible mother.  Advertisement  ""LMFAO i cannot imagine having an eating disorder themed wedding,"" reads one of the video's top comments, with 20,000 upvotes.  Cutler responded to this jab in a separate video, saying it was ""extremely low, hurtful, and harmful"" to label or diagnose someone who could possibly have mental health or body image issues.  ""If somebody is actually suffering, I think that that makes them feel more isolated,"" she told Insider.  Cutler said she didn't force guests to adhere to her diet  If anything, Cutler's intention was to inspire people with food intolerances to incorporate healthy habits when celebrating special occasions, she said.  ""I've never actually had anyone comment or attack me for eating disorders or promoting that in any way, shape, or form until this video,"" she said. Cutler added she has never been diagnosed with any type of eating disorder.  Advertisement  The creator believes some of the furor boils down to the mistaken notion that she forced her guests to hew to her diet. But guests had choices and ate standard fare, and many said it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, she said.  ""There was regular bread, we had multiple entree options that everyone was allowed to choose from at their table,"" she said. ""We had a lavish, top-shelf open bar.""  The bloat pills were optional too — stemming from a sponsorship with supplement brand Arrae, a longtime partner. (""Weddings are a really expensive time,"" Cutler said. ""If there's something you love and you can limit cost in any way, I think all the power to it."")  At the end of the day, Cutler stands by the video and says she's confident in knowing what works best for her body.  ""I'm not going to eat gluten and feel sick because it will make someone else comfortable,"" she said. ""I think the real conversation here is around removing food-shaming from social platforms … Everyone should be making the choices that work for them.""","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Chad Andrew “Drew” Kelly Jr. was known for his love of serving the town of Moncks Corner. But his life was cut short after he was killed in an “accident,” according to an online obituary.  Kelly died May 12, less than two months after he was married. He and his wife were “enjoying their new life together” before his death, a post on the Russell Funeral Chapel website said.  “Please keep the Kelly family and the Town of Moncks Corner Fire Department in your thoughts and prayers over the next several weeks. One cannot imagine the pain and loss both families are feeling,” the Moncks Corner Rural Fire Department wrote in a Facebook post.  Over the years, Kelly had served with that department and also worked as an engineer/EMT with the town of Mocks Corner, officials said.  “Drew’s passion in life was fighting fires and serving his community,” his obituary said. “He was 2021 Firefighter of the Year for the town of Moncks Corner.”  Kelly was also remembered for being a member of his church and for having a “beloved dog.” After Kelly’s death, several people flocked to social media to share their condolences.  “This loss is particularly painful for many,” the fire department said, noting that the news resonated across the Moncks Corner area.  Moncks Corner is in Berkeley County, roughly 30 miles northwest of Charleston.  Moncks Corner and the Rural Fire Department didn’t immediately share additional details with McClatchy News on May 15.

""The day of our ceremony, we have a disco-themed pool party,"" Underwood told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview ahead of the couple's big day. ""It's going to be a fun wedding,"" he adds, ""I'll say that!""  For their nuptials, the couple wore custom Tom Ford suits.

As guests made their way to the ceremony where a choir and orchestra performed, they were greeted by a beautiful photo display designed by the couple.

""It's inspired from a coffee table book that I was gifted after I came out called Loving and it's images of men in love throughout history.

Additionally, he wanted an unequivocal apology from the CM and threatened to take additional legal action against her for damaging their name in public if she did not comply.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL2ZpcnN0aW5kaWEuY28uaW4vbmV3cy9ib2xseXdvb2QvVml2ZWstYWduaWhvdHJpLW1lcmNpbGVzc2x5LXRyb2xsZWQtZm9yLXN0YXRpbmctdGhhdC1wZW9wbGUtZ2V0LW1hcnJpZWQtdG8tZ2V0LXdlZGRpbmctcGhvdG9zLWFuZC12aWRlb3PSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
