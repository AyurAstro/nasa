Police said the woman, Premalatha, 35, was found bludgeoned to death with a rod. Reportedly, the incident took place after midnight, when the couple returned from the woman’s house in Thumkunta after their wedding anniversary celebrations. Their two children, who are in high school, were at the grandmother’s house in Thumkunta for the ongoing summer vacation.  It is suspected that Janardhan and Premalatha were engaged in a heated argument, which turned violent.  According to the police, Janardhan, an alcoholic, had left the family last year. After his wife, an employee at a dental clinic, filed a complaint, police traced him later in April.  Police shifted the bodies for post-mortem. An investigation is under way.

Alongside choosing the menu, flowers and decorations and sorting the table plan, body image – how we think and feel about the way we look – can cause worries, too.  We could not identify any previous research that had formally looked at how brides in the UK felt about their body image. To address this, and fill the gap in our knowledge, our research explored how brides felt about their body image in the run-up to their wedding. We focused in particular on any appearance concerns that they had and how these made them feel – from the planning stage right up to the big day itself.  One hundred and thirty-four women took part in either an interview or an online survey. They were a mix of women planning their weddings and those who had been married in the past three years. Many women experienced feelings of pressure and expectation to look a certain way on their wedding day.  This article is part of Quarter Life, a series about issues affecting those of us in our twenties and thirties. From the challenges of beginning a career and taking care of our mental health, to the excitement of starting a family, adopting a pet or just making friends as an adult. The articles in this series explore the questions and bring answers as we navigate this turbulent period of life.  You may be interested in:  Love Island ditches fast fashion: how reality celebrities influence young shoppers’ habits  How to make your clothes last longer – it’s good for your bank account and the environment too  It’s not just weddings – how celebrating small wins and unconventional milestones can bring joy  They felt that this pressure came from various sources, including family and friends. They told us that others’ perceptions of how they looked affected their own feelings, both on the wedding day and afterwards. One said:  If you know other people think you look nice then you have more confidence.  Another told us:  I didn’t want to feel ashamed of my appearance. I knew there would be a lot of attention and comments on it. Didn’t want to feel like I’d let people down…there were lots of questions about my appearance and dresses mainly from other women. It felt like how I looked was part of the ‘decoration’ in the same way the table settings and order of service was.  Many of the women we spoke to felt the need to adhere to these pressures through fear of judgment and the expectation that all brides should look beautiful.  Looking back  The knowledge that wedding photographs and videos would provide permanent visual evidence of how they looked added to body image pressures. One said:  I wanted to look back at the photographs and feel 100% comfortable with what I saw.  The pressure felt by the women we spoke to also stemmed from the bridal industry, which perpetuates norms and assumptions about how brides should look. One woman, for example, talked about a bad experience she had in a bridalwear shop:  I felt the ladies in the dress shop were quite judgemental, saying I needed to eat better and basically lose weight, so I felt very negative towards me.  Nearly 70% of the women we spoke to who were planning their weddings intended to lose weight in preparation for their wedding day. The pressure to lose weight had a significant effect on their feelings and emotions. One said:  I’m really worried that preparing my weight for my wedding will re-trigger my anorexia and I don’t think people talk about the unnecessary pressure for brides and grooms to lose weight.  Some of the women reported going to extreme measures to achieve their weight-loss goals, including surgery. One had a gastric band fitted in the run-up to the wedding: this is a band around the stomach that limits its expansion, leading to feeling full sooner. Another had a tummy tuck – cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the stomach area.  Among the women we spoke to who were already married, only 27% had reached the weight they wanted to for their wedding. One said:  I was distressed when I realised I wouldn’t achieve this weight. I then felt fine approaching the day itself. However, I felt embarrassed after seeing photos of me and regretted getting married at my weight.  Our findings back up what other researchers have found in countries outside of the UK, such as in Australia and the US. This research has drawn attention to the powerful pressures related to wedding appearance and the expectation of how women should look when getting married.  If you are getting married, then it is completely natural for you to want to look your best, but prioritise your own wellbeing, too.  If one of your friends or family members is getting married, or if you work in the wedding industry, be conscious of what you are saying to the brides in your life. Make sure you are not inadvertently adding any pressures or expectations to them by commenting on their appearance during what can already be a stressful time. Focus on the joy and connection that is the real heart of a wedding."

Parrott opened Parrott Floral Co. last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  CEDAR RAPIDS -- Cassie Parrott has expressed herself through flowers all of her adult life.  “For me, it’s the creative side, and getting to share my artistic abilities through florals,” Parrott said one recent morning. “I’m horrible at drawing or painting or anything like that, but when it comes to being creative on the flower side...”  Parrott, 32, began working for florists soon after graduating from Cedar Rapids Jefferson High School, just a few blocks from her home. She kept working while completing Kirkwood Community College’s horticulture program.  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her Parrott Floral Co. home design studio last Wednesday in southwest Cedar Rapids. She opened her business last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Advertisement  Gaining some 15 years experience, Parrott and her husband, Joey, decided last year it was time to strike out on her own.  “I had been doing it for other businesses and just decided I wanted to be doing it for myself,” she said. “I knew what it all entailed, and what I needed.”  A small toolshed in her backyard became her studio, freshened with new paint and outfitted with work tables and a florist’s refrigerator to keep blooms fresh.  “Thankfully, we had this workshop,” she said. “It was just storage. We started converting, and it went really quickly after I decided I wanted to for-sure do it.”  Wedding specialty  Parrott’s goal is to specialize on weddings, but she’s taken other business during her start-up.  “From the beginning, I knew I was going to have to do some everyday retail,” she said. “Friends and family will say, ‘Hey, can you do a birthday bouquet for me tomorrow?’ And I can make it happen.”  Business News Newsletter Signup Newsletter Signup Delivered to your inbox weekdays Email Please wait...

Without a traditional storefront, which she didn’t want to invest in, Parrott typically begins the design process in customers’ homes, where being a one-woman operation has its advantages.  “I have the capabilities and the time to actually get to know each one of my brides and give my undivided attention to them and not have to worry about other customers coming in,” she said.  Large, elaborate displays are popular for this season’s weddings, she said.  “Big, colorful arches and hanging installations,” Parrott said. “Big statement pieces are the trendy things right now.”  Most customers have at least some idea what they’re after.  “A lot of times they have somewhat of a vision,” she said. “They’ve gone to Pinterest or Google or Instagram or TikTok and found pictures they like. I guide them and make it fit within their budget and make their vision come to life for them.”  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her home floral design studio in Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Using social media  Social media also is a key marketing tool.  “When you’re starting a business, anything free is helpful,” Parrott said. “Anytime we do a wedding and they post pictures and tag us in it, that helps spread the word.  “Those relationships with other wedding vendors help. A venue, a dress shop, a tux shop, a bakery, we all get together and make a mock wedding, and it’s photographed and we post that on our socials.”  Parrott works through a wholesale florist in Illinois and directly with big flower farms in Ecuador and Chile. In-season, she also buys locally grown blooms.  Managing deliveries, she said, is vital.  “When somebody’s buying a bouquet for a birthday or anniversary, they want that to last as long as possible. I want to get that in right before the occasion and get it out to them in the form where it’s barely started blooming,” she said. “With a wedding, they’re wanting (the full bloom). Depending what kinds of blooms, I have a process where I get them to their full potential for the wedding day.”  Friends, family help  Parrott is her namesake company’s sole full-time employee, but friends and family help with deliveries and building elaborate arrangements. Peak wedding season brings some early-morning starts.  “We’re always one of the first vendors at a wedding on Saturday,” she said. “You want to be in and out, so once they start with pictures that’s all done. By about noon I have everything set up.”  Cassie Parrott dyes flowers made out of wood shavings to create at floral arrangement for a client Wednesday at her home design studio in southwest Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Despite working through the pandemic’s lingering supply-chain effects -- Parrott estimates wholesale flower costs have tripled -- she’s optimistic about her business’ first busy season.  “When I opened, my main concern was just getting clients and getting my name out there as my business and myself,” she said. “But I’ve booked 11 weddings since September. For my first eight months, that seems like a pretty good number.”"

However, there were also many B-town celebs who decided to keep their wedding an intimate affair. The trend of having a secret and hush-hush wedding also started after the Covid-19 pandemic.  But, did you know that ‘Vivaah’ actress Amrita Rao married the love of her life RJ Anmol at a temple in Pune on a budget as low as Rs 1,50,000?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMRITA RAO 🇮🇳 (@amrita_rao_insta)  Recently, the couple released a YouTube video on their official channel wherein they elaborated on the cost of their wedding, the venue, and how they were able to pull off a close-knit shaadi in that budget.  In the ‘Anniversary Special’ episode of ‘Couple Of Things’, they took us down memory lane to the place they got married nine years ago.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The handful of people who attended their wedding traveled from Mumbai to Iskcon Temple in Katraj, Pune where the couple secretly tied the knot. As for the stay and other functions like Sangeet, Mehendi, and Karaoke Night, the couple booked a hotel on the outskirts of Pune.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The couple further revealed that the outfits they wore were very traditional and cost not more than Rs 3000 each because they didn’t want to wear designer clothes. The ‘Main Hoon Na’ actor also wore all artificial jewellery on her wedding day.  “When I told Anmol that I wanted to buy jewellery, he had told me ‘Abhi q shopping karni hai, tabhi karo na shaadi k baad.’ And when the wedding happened, we were busy building our house so we had no time to shop. So, I wore artificial jewellery top to bottom. I was very angry.”  In the video, the couple then visited their wedding venue and relived those fond memories.  Amrita further revealed that she also carried her makeup kit and did her wedding makeup herself. Her family members helped her get ready for the special occasion.  They also added that one of the reasons they wanted to get married in Pune was because Amrita’s grandparents were in Pune so it was easier for them to travel to the venue. Concluding the video, Amrita shared:  “We always believed that weddings should be about love, not about showing off wealth and ostentation. We wanted our wedding to be a beautiful, intimate affair with just our immediate families & close friends, and we’re glad we were able to achieve that without spending a fortune.”  To this, RJ Anmol added, “Our wedding was a reflection of our personalities, and we wanted to keep it humble. We would be happy if this inspires people to opt for budget-friendly weddings too.”  Clearly, you don’t have to spend crores to make memories and get married to the love of your life.

Nair told The Times that “she’d been inspired by the 2004 Broadway revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” a show built around cultural traditions adapting to survive.  The Times further notes that “like the film, the musical touches upon the fallout of India’s 1947 partition, brought to life in the characters’ religious, social and economic differences. Nair told the publication that the film is about “our families, but so deeply universal — this essential story of understanding a whole society and movement through a very personal story.”  However, the musical deviates a little from the film, in terms of messaging. For the musical, Nair had to revisit one of the film’s subplots, she told The Times, “about a relative’s grooming and sexual abuse of two younger family members.” A “concerted effort” was made to have “the women question the patriarchy and speak up,” Nair said. “Other characters who are afflicted by this don’t shove it under the rug; they make decisions in their own lives that reflect that they will not accept this behavior, which we didn’t have before.”  The change is reflective of Nair’s work which “has never shied away from examining cultural distinctions,” The Times notes. “Mississippi Masala” (1991) explored the interracial romance between a Black man and Indian American woman, “Salaam Bombay!” (1988), revolved around children living in the slums.  “Monsoon Wedding” is currently playing at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, through June 25."

The actor, in a recent interview, said that she “never felt more beautiful on screen” and called it a “liberating experience”.  In a chat with ETimes, Shabana recalled an incident from the time she was shooting for the film and had to attend a wedding after pack up. She shared that the attire that she was shooting in was befitting for a wedding so she attended the function in the same clothes and jewellery. “I remember in 2022 while shooting in Delhi for Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, I had to attend a wedding one evening. After the day’s shooting, I just took off wearing the saree and jewellery that I was shooting in,” she said.  Shabana Azmi shared that the film’s costume designer Manish Malhotra was “horrified” and said, “How can you go to a wedding wearing shooting clothes and jewellery? At least let me give you real jewellery.” But Shabana asked him to “relax” as it would be completely fine. “And it was. I looked quite presentable at the wedding, if I may say so myself,” she added.  Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani is Karan Johar’s next directorial. It marks his return as a director after 2016’s Ae Dil Hai Mushkil (Karan directed shorts in Lust Stories and Ghost Stories, respectively). The film, also starring Alia Bhatt, Ranveer Singh, Dharmendra, Jaya Bachchan, is scheduled to release on July 28.  In an earlier chat with Bollywood Life, Ranveer Singh described Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani as a “quintessential Karan Johar movie” and added, “It’s vintage Karan Johar, everything that you love about his films – the songs, the glamour, the good-looking leads, the family dynamics, the pulpy drama, the humour, the romance, it’s all packed in there; every trope you’ve seen in Karan Johar movies, his brand of cinema you have loved – all there.”"

The influencer, and sister of UFC star Conor McGregor, is set to wed long-term partner Terry Kavanagh in 2024, with the pair documenting their search for the perfect venue on social media.  Today's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOW  The mum-of-two did a recent Q&A [question and answer] on Instagram, with followers.  Erin McGregor has revealed she will not be opting for a church wedding when she walks down the aisle in 2024. Pic: Erin McGregor/Instagram  One follower asked the pair if they had decided between 'a wedding singer or music in the church?' prompting the duo to reveal they wouldn't be opting for a church wedding.  Erin answered: 'We don't want a church... do you want to say why we don't want a church?  'Eh, because of Harry,' Terry simply stated.  'So, Harry would feel better in an outdoor [setting] so it wouldn't be as overwhelming and the noise wouldn't be as intense for him,' Erin explained.  'Always worth the try' -- Erin McGregor shares realities of travelling with young son 'We want -- Har is our main man,' Terry added. Erin shared that six-year-old son Harry, who lives with autism, would be more comfortable outdoors, adding that he would be likely to want to leave a church setting.  'Yeah, so he can be part of it. Even if he wants to run off, he's still there where he'd probably want to leave a church.  'He likes the outdoors, so that works for us,' Terry said.  Turning their attention back to the question at hand, Erin asked her husband-to-be what type of music he wanted for their big day.

The Gardeners' World star, 67, and his wife Sarah were pictured at their son's nuptials back in July 2020 – which happened to be their own wedding anniversary. For the occasion, the pair proved their penchant for florals as they stepped out in summery outfits that may have been inspired by their Herefordshire garden, Longmeadow.  WATCH: Monty Don shares personal garden transformation  Monty offset his classic white shirt and black suit with a blue tie covered with yellow flowers, while Sarah tied in with his colour scheme in a stunning pastel blue frock. It featured a high neckline, long sleeves, a ditsy floral print and navy piping which she teamed with pearl drop earrings and her blonde hair in a sleek straight bob.  The celebrity gardener captioned the candid photo, which appears to have been taken at the wedding breakfast: ""3 years ago on this day Sarah and I were celebrating our son Adam’s marriage to Emily. On the same day 37 years ago we were married too.""  © Instagram Monty and Sarah's son got married in 2017  At the time, fans rushed to comment on the couple's outfits, writing: ""Look at you all poshed up,"" and: ""I love the tie."" A third added: ""Lucky Monty, Sarah is a beauty.""  Monty and Sarah chose much more timeless outfits on their own wedding day. On their 39th anniversary in 2022, he shared one rare throwback photo, taken in 1983, which showed the newlyweds standing outside a set of wrought iron gates, with Monty's new wife rocking an unconventional blue outfit.  Sarah ditched bridal white for a dusty cornflower jacket with large buttons down the front, which she paired with a chunky necklace and matching earrings.  Meanwhile, Monty didn't appear to have aged at all – he sported the same thick curly hair and big grin and wore a cream suit and black spotty tie.  He accompanied the photo with a heartfelt message to his childhood sweetheart Sarah, whom he met at Cambridge University. ""We got married 39 years ago today - the picture is a little faded, a little wrinkly, like us but the love is as evergreen and strong now as it was all those years ago,"" Monty sweetly wrote.  Monty and Sarah share three children, Tom, Adam and Freya, and they are proud grandparents to George and Daisy Rose. However, Sarah candidly opened up about her ill health following childbirth and the impact it had on their marriage in their book, The Jewel Garden.  ""I was ill for months after our daughter was born despite having had a supposedly film-star birth at an enormously expensive private London hospital,"" Sarah wrote. ""I had a slipped disc, a result of the bodged delivery, and was so anaemic that I needed a blood transfusion.  ""My injuries were not acknowledged and as we tried to leave the hospital I had to walk down three flights of stairs because the lift had broken. I was unable to walk or stand properly for over a year,"" she shared.  Being bedridden put a strain on their relationship, with Sarah candidly writing: ""When it came down to it, Montagu was a loony and I was ill all the time.""

She donned a pink, peachy shade that was minimal, yet memorable – perfectly in line with her understated elegance and effortless personal style.  On her wedding day, Richie told Vogue that she wanted her look to feel timeless. Richie enlisted makeup artist Pati Dubroff, who leaned into subtle enhancements to the star’s natural beauty. Paired with a glossy gold lid and sunkissed blush, Dubroff accentuated her lips with a sheerness that wasn’t too saturated. “We wanted the lips to look fresh and soft, and not have a weighty lipstick feeling. Kissable lips!” she explains. In the end, this was achieved with a Chanel tinted lip balm accompanied by a natural contour shade lip pencil.  Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Hydrating Beautifying Tinted Lip Balm Buildable Colour £34 at CHANEL  Part of the intrigue of Rouge Coco Baume is how it veils the lips in a practical, buildable colour. As you layer your chosen shade, the finish transforms from a sheer, barely there color to a more opaque and luminous pigment. Richie’s lip was done with shade 928 Pink Delight, one of nine shades that range from rich reds to iridescent pearls. My personal favorite? 914 Natural Charm, which enhances my pout’s natural colour.  “The Rouge Coco Baume range is hydrating and my constant go to!” Dubroff says, admitting that the formula is perfect for not only summer but in cooler temperatures when lips are more easily chapped. Why? The balm is enriched with a fruit and olive leaf-derived oil that boasts antioxidant and rejuvenation benefits – meaning lips are soft, hydrated, and smoother upon application. With its conditioning properties and sheer, never-shiny tint, it’s safe to say I’ve found my ultimate summer lip.  Below, shop the rest of Sofia Richie’s bridal beauty look."

There were whispers leading up to the day that Kate would forgo crown jewels at the request of the King because he wanted a more modest ceremony (not sure if we would call this event less opulent, but okay). And veering far from tradition, Kate chose a bespoke leafy-floral headpiece crafted from sequins, metallic beading and sparkling silver threadwork by Jess Collett X Alexander McQueen. It was a royal fashion moment for the books (as was the matching smaller version of the headpiece worn by Princess Charlotte), and one that has tipped off a trend of exquisite and elaborate bejewelled wedding headpieces as coveted accessory.  “I thought Catherine’s headpiece conveyed a youthful and whimsical vibe,” says Toronto-based accessory designer Blair Nadeau, founder and owner of Blair Nadeau Bridal Adornments, who is renowned for her exquisite jewellery, veils, hair accessories and crowns. “I literally squealed when I saw it. This accessory didn’t feel old and stuffy, it felt fresh. I loved the tiered leaf and floral motif and the doubled-banded style. The look is perfect for a wedding because it’s elegant and impactful and very modern feeling.”  Nadeau says the organic shape of Kate’s instantly iconic headpiece is what makes it easy and effortless for brides to wear. “We are still in a bit of a minimalist era but starting to see the emergence of softer silhouettes and more texture with three-dimensional details like floral embellishments and lace patterns,” she shares. “The silver tone provided an airy lightness that is very much happening now with accessories after years of bold gold designs.”  If you’re feeling the luxe headpiece vibe for your wedding day, Nadeau has a few thoughts on how to wear them. Pair a design like Kate’s with a light and airy dress with a fluid silhouette made from tulle, chiffon or lace. She also recommends keeping hair easy and not overly styled. “I actually love the juxtaposition of soft waves with a statement headpiece,” says Nadeau. “If you do wear it up, keep it soft and a little imperfect, not too sleek.”  As for adding other wedding accessories, keep it simple and classic. Kate opted for a pair of diamond and South Sea pearl drop earrings that belonged to Princess Diana, which Nadeau says worked because they complemented the motif of her headpiece. “I actually love a veil combined with a statement headpiece, but the trick is to keep it simple and minimal,” she says. “Always remember your wedding accessories are there to complement you and your dress.”  Bejewelled wedding headpieces to shop now  This bold trend is here to stay for several wedding seasons  The shape and finish of the Victoria headpiece is very much in step with the Princess of Wales’s style on Coronation day. It’s the perfect match for big, bold and volumized hair!  The Arielle headband by Jennifer Behr was first launched in 2010 and continues to be a runaway bestseller. It features hundreds of Swarovski-crystal-adorned leaves fastened to a silver ribbon-wrapped skinny headband.  The Millaray crown features a dramatic criss-cross design that creates a delicate and bold effect. Crafted from crystal beads, enamel and brass flowers, sterling-silver-plated wire and Mokuba silk ribbon, this piece is truly breathtaking.  The Cecilia headband is bedazzling hand-crafted custom piece that can take up to 16 weeks to receive from order date, so plan accordingly. This beauty is hanndmade from rhodium plating and is detailed with fresh water pearls and Swarovski crystals.  The Henri headband mixes pearls and crystals to create a maximum impact wedding accessory. This one would look amazing as a re-wear for any weddings or formal events on your upcoming calendar.  This is an amazing piece of hair jewellery that is very deco-inspired! It wraps around your head and is anchored by two dazzling leaf motifs on either side—so dramatic and so different!  We love the vintage vibe bow design of this glittering headband by designer Keren Wolf. This halo-style headpiece is easy to wear and pairs beautifully with easy, breezy wedding hair.

Don’t dredge up drunken antics. And whatever you do, don’t wing it.  But a new etiquette question has recently emerged: Can you use AI to write them?  Couples and their loved ones are putting ChatGPT to the emotional Turing test, as they seek to give vows and toasts that are personal and eloquent but don’t rely on a writerly touch. What they’re finding is that AI can’t beat a human on the feelings front—phew!—but it can perhaps help prompt memories or create structure.  Ten days before her wedding, Kelly Tenn, 35, found herself on the planning website Joy, answering prompts from its free AI speechwriting tool, which relies on OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology.  “For me, there’s obviously this big craze around AI tools over the past few months, and I was a bit skeptical to try to use a tool like this,"" said Ms. Tenn, a brand-marketing executive for a cloud-technology company in San Francisco. She doesn’t find writing hard—“I work in content,"" she said—but for vows “it takes a little bit more creativity in how you articulate something that is summarizing your relationship over many years and years to come.""  Ms. Tenn used the product to create multiple versions of AI-generated vows, including prose “spoken like a friend"" and “Shakespearean-style verbiage"" (“So often have I pondered our love and asked, wherefrom hath thy love descended so unexpectedly?""). Ultimately she scrapped the drafts, which she found basic and nondescript, but she said using the tool helped her break out of writer’s block.  The tool also eased her woes about getting up in front of a crowd on her wedding day. “Public speaking is not something I prefer to do,"" Ms. Tenn said. “This is one of many ways to help lower the barrier and alleviate nerves.""  Write Your Own Vows Using AI  Let’s write vows to an imaginary spouse. Once you answer these questions, the AI tool ChatGPT will generate vows based on your responses.  Ahead of their April wedding, Jeff and Allison Hood of Atlanta used Provenance’s toast and vow builder, which launched in early 2023. It prompts each partner to share stories, memories and promises for their future spouse. Through the service, which costs $19.99, each partner can also view the relative length and tone of their significant others’ vows without seeing the contents.  “There was really nothing that didn’t sound like my authentic voice,"" said Mr. Hood, 34, a custom clothier. Since he’s “not a novelist,"" he was grateful that the tool presented his thoughts in a way that flowed well.  Ms. Hood, 32 and head of growth for a digital-marketing agency, kept a running list in her phone of all the things she loves about her partner since they started dating four years ago. “They’re just like ‘I stubbed my toe and he brought me a Band-Aid and I felt so special,’"" she said. “It wasn’t something I could actually say on my wedding day.""  Left to her own devices, Ms. Hood said her vows would have sounded as though they had been written by a second-grader: “Will you marry me? Check ‘yes’ or ‘no.’"" Reading what Provenance came up with, she thought, “‘Wow, I would have never worded it this way and it sounds so thoughtful—and the way that I actually feel.’""  Less than two weeks before giving a rehearsal-dinner toast for a best friend’s wedding, Randi Kramer, 29, thought: How do I capture nearly a decade of friendship in just a few minutes? Another friend suggested she try ToastWiz, a paid service for crafting speeches that uses AI.  “More than anything, it was a tool that got me past writer’s block,"" said Ms. Kramer, an associate editor at a publishing house in New York City. Thanks to prompts the form gave her—such as asking for adjectives to describe the couple and a favorite anecdote about the bride—Ms. Kramer was finally able “to get the juices flowing.""  She paid $30 for three speech drafts. “I was able to Frankenstein it together,"" she said, estimating that a third of what the chatbot produced made it into her final speech.  “I definitely didn’t tell anyone,"" she said, of using the service.  Julia Rosenson, 25, a software engineer in New York City, used Joy’s service to help write her maid of honor speech for her sister’s coming September wedding. While she’s found it to be “a fun little tool"" to play with, Ms. Rosenson said it should only be used for inspiration.  “It’s pretty hit or miss—mostly miss—just because they don’t know my sister at all,"" she said, “but they put together a whole story,"" adding that it was quite funny to read. “It generates anecdotes as if I were going to tell a story about my sister and her fiancé on a camping trip they never took, or some pivotal imaginary relationship moment,"" Ms. Rosenson said.  Joy’s CEO Vishal Joshi said the tool’s invented anecdotes should be seen as placeholders for personal material. “It will make up interesting stories where it could be like, ‘OK, a story quote over here would be nice,’"" he said.  Kyle and Sarah Kuo, both 26, of Tempe, Ariz., used Provenance to prepare for their April 2023 wedding. Ms. Kuo, a registered nurse at an outpatient family practice, especially liked the fact that you could cross-check your partner’s vows to make sure you were on the same page, tone-wise.  “You don’t want to put too many jokes in there if your partner is being serious and sentimental,"" she said.  For his part, Mr. Kuo, a director of operations at a production company, was just glad to have his time back.  “I would have had to Google ‘how to write your vows’ and read through, you know, nine articles,"" he said."

Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  In the days after Russia's invasion last year, Ukrainian forces need help targeting Russian troops.  One Ukrainian artillery unit relied on help from Ukrainian civilians to guide their strikes.  Using repurposed drones, cameras and phones, and Google Maps, that unit put rounds on its targets.  Hobby drones and Google Maps were designed to enhance human life, not to end it, but when Russian tank columns seemed to be closing in on Kyiv in the days after Russia's attack on February 24, 2022, desperate Ukrainian defenders found they had two unlikely assets.  Col. Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine's 43rd Artillery Brigade, and Col. Serhiy Ogerenko, the brigade's chief of staff, told Ukrainian media that they were able to use civilian drones and Google Maps, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian civilians, to locate and target Russian forces in the early days of the war.  At the time, Ukrainian gunners faced the problem of hitting Russian vehicles — moving targets — without trained forward observers to estimate where the vehicle would be when the shell landed.  ""That's why we needed 'eyes,'"" Ogerenko said. ""We called civilians and asked, 'Do you see this section of the road? If a shell hits in a minute and a half, can you tell us at least roughly where it exploded?' Then the person would describe the place of the explosion, and we would open a Google map and see, yes, there is such a place behind the vegetable gardens.""  A woman uses her smartphone in a house damaged by shelling in southeastern Kyiv in March 2022. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images  Civilians also offered to use their hobby drones as scouts and artillery spotters. DJI Mavic quadcopters — nicknamed ""wedding drones"" because that is what they were used to record before the war — proved invaluable to the 43rd Artillery Brigade.  ""They provided the picture,"" Shevchuk said, according to a translation of the interview. ""4G, WhatsApp, a video call — the cameraman picked up, saw something, took off his phone, and said, 'look what I have.' I looked at it and said, 'hold it. We're going to shoot now.' It was convenient.""  Story continues  Drones — both military-designed and civilian models — are among the most vital assets for troops on both sides of the war. Ukrainian and Russian drones prowl the skies constantly, looking for enemy positions and movements, as well as for artillery batteries, supply depots, and command posts.  Shevchuk recounted how ""one guy from a gas station even gave us access to his camera."" Rather than explain the situation to Ukrainian gunners, the owner told them, ""'here's the password. See for yourself,'"" Shevchuk recalled. ""That's how we saw our first live target — a column of Chechens near Novyi Bykiv [37 miles from Kyiv] heading towards Kyiv. So we 'met' them three kilometers [1.9 miles] further.""  A drone operator corrects Ukrainian 82mm mortar fire toward Russian positions in the Donetsk region in April. SERGEY SHESTAK/AFP via Getty Images  Sometimes Ukrainian forces would get indications that Russian troops were in a village, but not their precise location. ""We open a Google map, see a store, see its phone number, and dial it,"" said Shevchuk, who described a typical conversation:  ""Good evening, we are from Ukraine! Do you have any Katsaps [Ukrainian slur for Russians] in the village?"" ""Yes."" ""Where?"" ""Behind Grandma Hanna's house."" ""What house does Grandma Hanna have?"" ""Well, everyone knows her!""  ""So you talk to people a little bit and realize where everything is,"" Shevchuk added.  This isn't the only example of how Ukrainian civil society is using consumer technology to enhance Ukraine's military capabilities. To cope with waves of Russian long-range drones penetrating deep into Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainian military has formed mobile air-defense teams equipped with short-range anti-aircraft weapons.  Ordinary citizens can use cellphone apps to report drone sightings to a central database, which can then alert mobile air-defense units.  Ukrainian troops fire an 2S7 Pion howitzer at Russian positions near Bakhmut in March. Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Ukrainians using video cameras and cellphones to call in artillery fire on Russians forces as they pass by is a bizarre, almost comical, illustration of how a modern war can play out in an urban environment. But it also shows how much danger those civilians faced from invaders intent on defeating Ukraine's military and then repressing the Ukrainian public.  Russian troops and Wagner Group mercenaries have been accused of numerous atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, and Moscow has clamped down on Ukrainians living in areas it still controls in an effort to prevent attacks by partisans or special-operations forces. Anyone suspected of providing intelligence to Ukraine's devastatingly effective artillery could expect little mercy.  ""We lost contact with many people, and some said: 'That's it, I'm turning off my phone, deleting all my contacts. There are Russians in the next house,'"" Shevchuk said of civilians his forces were in contact with. ""Some people immediately said: 'I'm scared, don't ask me any questions.' But people called us from everywhere.""  Michael Peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in Forbes, Defense News, Foreign Policy magazine, and other publications.

There’s the compliment of being asked to celebrate the nuptials of friends, making you feel a tiny bit important, or at least, definitely not a c-lister.  The c-listers are relegated to the ‘insult’ otherwise known as the ‘afters’ where sandwiches are served and you might be offloaded with a slice of wedding cake.  The afters really are something of an after-thought for people that don’t make the grade but can’t be completely forgotten about either.  Are they expected to give a gift to the couple? It’s a bit of a minefield.  Thankfully, most of my friends are not the marrying kind so I haven’t been encumbered with the diplomatic shenanigans involved in trying to decide on a gift versus cash. I believe cash is king. (There’s no point in buying a toaster or some other kitchen implement for a couple that will most likely have been living together for years and have everything they need.)  But what is really tricky is the invitation to a destination wedding. It’s all very well if you decide to get married on a beach in Bali in flip flops and a floaty white dress. But think of the guests.  A couple may find it hard to believe, but travelling for a wedding is often seen as hassle and as expensive.  It requires taking some of your annual leave from work, which you might really resent, having hoped to save your days off to go on a decent holiday of your own choice.  You really may not want to have to rock up somewhere in Italy for a wedding event that, in the old days, used to just take place over the course of a day.  It’s downright cheeky to assume that your friends and family will welcome a wedding abroad. While close family members have no choice but to follow the couple to a hired villa in France or wherever, friends will be counting the cost.  You’re talking a few grand (at least €2,000) which is a big ask for a guest. There’s all the logistics of getting from the airport to the wedding venue which might be hours away, somewhere deep in the Italian countryside.  Scenic and romantic? Certainly, but far from practical.  Whatever happened to the Saturday wedding in a hotel serving beef or salmon? Now, folk want to emulate celebrities with their fancy notions involving hiring a wedding planner and dragging their mates abroad because ‘it’s all about the experience’.  Yes, making memories can be expensive.  But now you have the perfect excuse to decline an invitation to a wedding in some far-flung place. It’s our old enemy – the carbon footprint.  Can you really justify a flight when at least 2.4% of global emissions come from aviation?  Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming.  While that may not seem like a massive contributor, only a small percentage of the world flies frequently. It’s for the relatively rich and indulgent.  Put that on your wedding invitation refusal and you should be off the hook. (On the other hand, if you have plenty of time on your hands, you could indulge in ‘slow travel’ using boats and trains and coaches to get to the celebrations). Now that could be a great and memorable trip. But time may not be on your side.  Most of us are wage slaves unable to dedicate days and days to just travelling to a destination.  According to a BBC report, a return flight from London to San Francisco emits around 5.5 tonnes of CO2 per person, more than twice the emissions produced by a family car in a year and about half of the average carbon footprint of someone living in the UK.  Even a fairly short return flight from London to Berlin emits three times the emissions saved from a year of recycling.  A study involving 29 international students asked them to rate the importance of different flights they had taken. Just 58% of the flights were rated ‘very important’ or ‘important’.  And really, how important is a flight to the Caribbean for a wedding party?  Unless you’re close family, you’d be justified in turning down the invitation – on environmental grounds.  Some people compensate for the emissions from their flights by buying a carbon offset. But this is a bit of a cod. Trees, for example, need years to grow enough to reabsorb the carbon from your flight, and there’s no guarantee they’ll be left standing long enough to counteract your flight emissions.  That kind of thing is for the wealthy who continue contributing to climate change, offsetting, but not changing their behaviour.  The solution to destination weddings? Elope. Just the two of you."

He is my absolute rock.  ""And having spent so much of my life without him, I just knew I wanted my dad to be there at my wedding.”  Realising that she had so much to organise in a short time, Sophie appealed for help on community Facebook group Witney Spotted.

Multiple wedding dresses were offered in varying sizes.  Sophie said: “I can’t keep up with the offers. It's been so overwhelming.  “The hardest part was going to be finding a venue at such short notice particularly with summer coming and that was why I reached out.  ""But I was blown away by the response.  “I’ve been in touch with a couple of people who have offered wedding dresses and I have a friend who works in Blossom Bridal in Witney and I’m going to try some on to get the size and the style and then I will be looking at second hand offers and in Barnado’s.”  At the moment the likely venue is Witney’s Corn Exchange for a date around September 16.

Alyssa and Duncan were matched on the experiment together and after a series of ups and downs, Duncan eventually called it a day on their relationship.  Talking about her MAFS Australia wedding, Alyssa told Hello! Magazine she told Duncan she was a single parent and was disappointed it was never aired for viewers to see.  “I don’t know why they didn’t show it, it totally perpetuates the stigma around single parents,” she said. “It was suddenly revealed like, ‘I have a child. I have a child’.  “And then people were like, ‘When did she even tell him? When is she going to tell him?’ And I said, ‘Well guys, I was really upfront and honest, I told him straight away!’ I literally do not know why they didn’t show it,” Alyssa explained about their wedding on MAFS Australia.  Duncan has recently moved on from Alyssa and is now in a relationship with his co-star Evelyn Ellis. The happy couple announced the news in a Honesty Box session with 9Entertainment and it was incredibly wholesome.  “All of a sudden we went on a couple of nights, and some of the warm fuzzy feelings happened in my stomach and I thought, ‘What’s this? How we going here?’ Then one thing led to another,” Duncan said explaining how they started dating.

The current world champion F1 driver was racing as part of his virtual F1 Team Redline streaming with another member Chris Lulham.  Verstappen apparently decided to join the competition at the last minute after Lulham had complained about the amount of work he had to do for his upcoming exams.  Lulham was on the call talking with Verstappen while the F1 driver took part in the race.  During the race Lulham tries to defend himself saying: “If I had raced I would have had to rock up with like five hours break.”  However, Verstappen quickly cuts him off saying: “I cancelled a wedding for it.”  Lulham suggests that Verstappen was happy to cancel his plans though saying: “Don’t tell me this isn’t what you’d rather be doing.”  To which Verstappen replies: “I love sim racing, but sometimes you have to think about the greater good.”  Verstappen has previously shown that he is almost as passionate about virtual F1 racing as he is about the real deal.  He slammed Le Mans Virtual’s organisers after issues with the servers prevented him from finishing.  Recently, he installed a full F1 simulator in his £12million private jet so that he can practise on the go.  Despite Verstappen’s absence, Piquet appears to have had a great time at the wedding, with a fan commenting on her post that Piquet even managed to catch the bouquet.

Princess Anne's daughter tied the knot with Mike Tindall on 30 July 2011 at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, stepping out of the car with her father Captain Mark Phillips wearing a gown by Stewart Parvin, one of her grandmother's favourite couturiers. The long ivory silk dress featured a Duchess satin trim and a chevron pleated corseted bodice, which she teamed with a fine tulle veil secured in place with a precious Greek tiara known as Princess Andrew's Meander Tiara.  WATCH: Zara and Mike Tindall spotted for the first time following their wedding ceremony  But did you know the headpiece, estimated to be worth £280,000 ($350,000), had a special meaning?  Zack Stone from Seven Stone explained: ""It’s a particularly sentimental piece as Princess Alice gave it to Queen Elizabeth II as a wedding present in 1947, who later passed it on to Zara’s mother, Princess Anne.  © Getty Zara's Greek tiara was given to Queen Elizabeth on her wedding day  ""Made of diamonds, the tiara's Greek key design is punctuated by a central laurel wreath element and two honeysuckle elements. The design suggests an early twentieth-century creation, with the earliest photos of Princess Alice wearing the tiara having been taken around 1914.  LOOK: Princess Anne's colour-clashing wedding guest dresses are like nothing you've ever seen  ""I’d estimate the striking piece to be worth £280,000 ($350,000).""  Zara and Mike got married in Edinburgh in 2011  The honeysuckles on the 'something borrowed' piece from Prince Philip's mother Princess Alice of Battenberg are said to symbolise pure happiness, while the laurel wreath design was used as a Greek symbol of triumph – both fitting for Olympic equestrian Zara's big day.  For the royal wedding, mother-of-the-bride Princess Anne looked striking in a peach pleated dress, cream and pink embroidered jacket and an elaborate lace and flower detail fascinator, while the Queen also chose a pastel pink ensemble accessorised with a beautiful diamond lapel brooch.  © Getty Anne wore a pink pleated mother of the bride dress  Zara wasn't the only member of the royal family to turn to Queen Elizabeth's jewellery collection for her wedding day. Princess Anne borrowed Queen Mary's Fringe Tiara – worn by her mother in 1947 – for her nuptials in 1973, which was then loaned to Princess Beatrice for her low-key pandemic wedding with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020.  Meanwhile, Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara, and the Duchess of Sussex wore Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara – a last-minute change after originally being offered the late Princess Diana's glittering headpiece.  It is not known who inherited the accessories after the Queen passed away in September 2022. It's possible they will continue to be passed down and may now belong to Princess Anne, who already loaned tiaras to her daughter Zara and former daughter-in-law Autumn Phillips.

Quoting from the comedy Borat, he recalls, ""My first thought was, 'Wa-wa-wee-wa!' I didn't know what to think. She looked incredible – stunning!"" Familiar faces from Jono And Ben, 7 Days and Funny Girls, the lovebirds – known together as comedy duo Two Hearts – married on 30 December 2022 at Nadia Lim's Royalburn Farm in the Crown Ranges near Arrowtown.  A-list guests, including Hilary Barry, Rose Matafeo, Chris Parker, Brynley Stent, Tom Sainsbury and Hayley Sproull, descended on the Queenstown-Lakes District for three fun-filled days of festivities. Laura laughs, ""We seriously considered eloping because we felt huge pressure to have this amazing wedding!""  The blooming gorgeous bride gets a cuddle from Rose.  Fortunately, the spectacular day went off without a hitch – and Laura, 32, and Joseph, 34, are now Zooming in to chat about it from Australia after sell-out gigs at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. By the time you read this, they'll have performed in Wellington. And this week, it's Auckland's turn to see their show Til Death Do Us Hearts, which they describe as ""an intimate evening of songs about love, life and maintaining a successful relationship with your co-worker"". But back to the wedding… The fun-loving couple wanted their big day to be full of excitement and surprises for everyone, so it started with a laugh-a-minute bus ride to the venue, featuring some of their favourite pop songs and hilarious mock commentary from a voiceover artist who introduces the fireworks at Disneyland. Joseph jokes he spent ""five times longer"" on this part of the wedding than he did his vows! Former Seven Sharp reporter Laura has stayed good friends with Nadia ever since the 2019 season of Dancing With The Stars and says the MasterChef judge's farm, with its stunning views out to Lake Wakatipu, made for a ""special"" venue. She adds, ""I went to Nadia's the night before and they've got a little apartment I stayed in. Nadia was heavily pregnant at the time, but she still made me dinner, which was so cute!"" Laughing, Joseph jokes, ""It was just a My Food Bag.""  The bride with pregnant pal Nadia and her husband Carlos Bagrie.  The ceremony was sweet and simple – the only real tradition they followed was Laura spending the night apart from her groom. She explains, ""We spend our lives so deeply intertwined. This was the one thing we could do to be like, 'OK, let's build this up!'"" Being reunited at the altar was a powerful moment. An uncharacteristically serious Joseph says, ""We're always going to treasure that memory."" They both get emotional recalling groomsmen Paul Williams (Taskmaster NZ) and Nic Sampson (The Brokenwood Mysteries) bursting into tears. Joseph adds, ""I really like that we made a lot of our friends cry to a Jason Derulo song!"" True to their nature, a few details were left to the last minute. Joseph says, ""I remember I emailed the suit makers, 'Hello, I'd like one wedding suit please,' and they replied, 'When's your wedding?' When I told them it was in a month, they were like, 'But we have to make it in Italy!'"" Fortunately, it arrived three days before they left for Queenstown.  The bridal party (from left): Alice Harbourne, Simone Nathan,  Steph Badham, Eli Matthewson, Brynley Stent and Zara Cormack.  Similarly, Laura says, ""We both wrote our vows the night before the wedding."" She'd sought help from newlywed comedian Chris, who told her, ""The vows will just come to you."" She says she and Joseph often have to write jokes under pressure for work, adding, ""That's when our best stuff comes out!"" The reception was under a huge tent decorated with fairy lights and flowers. There were games, speeches, drinks and  a vegetarian dinner. As for the first dance, Laura says, ""We didn't do a big, choreographed number, which a few people were expecting, but we did a cute sway side to side."" The party went on into the early hours of the morning, with dancing, singing and a saxophonist playing alongside the DJ. ""It was really going off!"" Laura exclaims delightedly. And then it was round two of partying the next day for New Year's Eve, with the newlyweds heading off on honeymoon to Hawaii. ""It rocked – I had the best time!"" declares Laura, prompting Joseph to ask, ""The honeymoon or the wedding?"" ""Both!"" Laura quickly chirps, adding that Disneyland was also on the itinerary – a visit that inspired a song in Til Death Do Us Hearts, which is part of the New Zealand International Comedy Festival.  The newlyweds honeymooned in Disneyland.  The pair first performed as a duo, but just as friends, back in 2017, with the final song in their act being about how they would never end up together. Now they're performing in Aotearoa for the first time as husband and wife, although they insist not much has changed. ""We're still renting with a flatmate and our lives are still very much the same, but it's nice to call him my husband now and to celebrate the milestones,"" says Laura. Joseph agrees, explaining that the main reason for them getting married was to create ""memories of such a special day with family and friends"". ""The lead-up to the wedding was so stressful,"" adds Laura. ""We thought, 'What are we doing?!' But then we had the wedding and were like, 'Hell, yeah, that was absolutely worth it!'"" Clearly still besotted with each other, Laura and Joseph pause when asked what's coming up for them. Laura is pensive. ""I guess we're in a phase of deciding what to do next with our lives,"" she reflects, adding that sell-out Aussie shows and one of their videos going viral in Europe have made moving overseas a temptation. International audiences are very vocal, tells Laura.  You can see their love for real in Til Death Do Us Hearts."

Of course, that required a little trickery.  Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in January 2021. In an April 2021 social media post announcing their union, the couple said they felt “chuffed about it.” (Chuffed is British slang for “very pleased.”)  “For the record: this is me gushing,” Gadsby wrote in the caption. “I am full of very positive feelings. This is a nice story.”  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  In their new special, which Gadsby describes as “a feel-good show,” the comedian shares more details about their wedding, including the story behind their hilariously non-traditional novelty wedding cake.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake,” Gadsby explains in Something Special, “and it worked.”  Gadsby recently shared a photo of the cake in question on their Instagram. It features a massive shark about to devour two adorable otters swimming serenely side-by-side.  “I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10,’” Gadsby recalls in their special. “Easy. So gullible. Will believe anything, Christians.”  Cakes have, of course, become one of the most unexpected battlegrounds in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. (Just imagine what Harvey Milk or veterans of the Stonewall uprising would’ve said if you told them that, in 2023, we would be suing bakers over cakes.)  In probably the most famous instance of cake discrimination, Jack Phillips, the anti-gay owner of Colorado’s Masterpiece Cakeshop, sued the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) in 2015 after it told him that his refusal to provide an LGBTQ+ couple’s wedding cake violated the state’s law prohibiting businesses open to the public from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Phillips, but did not rule on the question of whether he had a First Amendment right to refuse to make a gay wedding cake.  Phillips was sued again in 2018, this time by a trans customer for whom he refused to make a cake celebrating both her birthday and her anniversary of coming out as trans. In 2021, a Denver judge ruled that Phillips illegally discriminated against Autumn Scardina when he refused to make the cake. Earlier this year, the Colorado Court of Appeals again ruled against Phillips in the case.  More recently, in Florida, a Publix grocery store refused to write “Trans People Deserve Joy” on a cake for a trans nonprofit organization. The company later apologized, claiming that employees at the Orland-area store were mistaken in believing that writing a trans-affirming message on a cake was against corporate policy."

This category includes everything from appetizers that circulate during the cocktail hour to late-night snacks — and, of course, the wedding cake.  Given the tradition of the bride and groom cutting the cake together, many couples are very particular about their wedding cake. That means they're often willing to pay a bit extra for a truly show-stopping creation. However, the most expensive slice of wedding cake ever sold probably isn't something you'd want to consider eating — given that it was over 80 years old at the time of sale.  Back in 1998, two individuals in San Francisco made Guinness World Records history. Their feat? Shelling out a staggering $29,900 U.S. dollars in order to purchase a single piece of wedding cake, packaged in a box and sold at auction. Though the crew at Sotheby's figured the sweet treat from decades past would fetch somewhere between $500 and $1,000, Benjamin and Amanda Yin were willing to pay a whole lot more for the item.  In truth, they were buying a slice of history. The piece of the cake in question was served at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937.

Many brides fantasize about walking down the aisle in a gown that looks like it belongs on the set of “Bridgerton” or “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.” This fantasy can now become a reality thanks to Allure Bridals’ new line of dresses. The premier wedding designer is collaborating with Shondaland to create gowns that are fit for a Queen herself … Queen Charlotte, that is.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Inspired by the sumptuous gowns in the Bridgerverse, these gowns will be a modern and wearable take on the dresses we drool over on “Bridgerton” and “Queen Charlotte.”  The Queen Charlotte gowns from Allure Bridals will be designed by none other than Shondaland’s Lyn Paolo. Paola has worked on many Shonda Rhimes’ projects, including “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Scandal,” and most recently served as Costume Designer for “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.”  “I love the worlds that [Shonda] creates and it is an absolute delight to fill those worlds with beautiful costumes,” Lyn Paolo, Shondaland’s creative director and designer, said in a press release. “Now I am excited to help design beautiful gowns inspired by the world she has created for today’s beautiful brides.”  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Though the collaboration shared Paolo’s sketches of the gowns ahead of their release, the Allure Bridals x Shondaland wedding gowns won’t be available until December 2023. The dresses are moderately priced, starting at around $1,600. (According to The Knot, the average wedding dress was $1,900 in 2022.) There are more luxe options in the Shondaland line that can range up to $3,000, so brides can find the dress that best suits their budget.  As you can see from the sketches of the gowns, these dresses bring the drama. Forget minimalism and austere design: These wedding dresses are designed with romance and royalty in mind.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  “The intricate details, lavish fabrics, and timeless elegance of Queen Charlotte and the ton’s fashion are a perfect fit for our bridal gowns, and we can’t wait to unveil this special collection to brides around the world,” says Kelly Crum, CEO of Allure Bridals.  The new line of Allure Bridals x Shondaland dresses can be found at bridal stores worldwide at the end of this year. Grooms not included.  This story originally appeared on Simplemost.

Designed to tie in bridal attire with the ceremony aesthetic, this arrangement of florals brings a whimsical touch to the bride's aesthetic. Designers can get quite creative and create bouquets big and small for brides to walk down the aisle with that feature a wild melange of blooms or just a singular kind of flower. While the types of florals used within a bouquet can vary greatly, there are a few more popular blooms and filler flowers used in this wedding arrangement. However, these are usually accented with less common ones for intrigue.  ""Floral designers today strive for innovation, especially in the era of social media,"" shares floral designer Shean Matthew Strong. ""It is crucial to create floral art pieces that truly showcase their talent. As a designer, incorporating unique elements is always a safe bet. This could be as simple as including herbs like mint, rosemary, or lavender in a bouquet, or something more captivating like a Hellebore, anthurium, or garden roses.""  Meet the Expert Shean Matthew Strong is a wedding and event floral designer. He is the owner and founder of Shean Strong Design.  Want to learn what are the most popular florals found in the wedding bouquet? Read ahead to learn about standout blooms and filler flowers often used in this iconic arrangement.  Photo by Amy and Stuart Photography  Popular Bouquet Flowers  Larger flowers with structure and plenty of petals are often the primary florals you will find in a wedding bouquet. One of the most popular types of flowers used in all kinds of weddings arrangements are roses. Found in hues ranging from bright whites to light pinks to deep reds, a rose is a timeless wedding bloom that can help your bouquet tie into your palette. A commonly used alternative to this bloom is ranunculus. These florals can add texture and movement to a bouquet thanks to their ruffly petals.  Show-stopping peonies are just as popular as roses, thanks to their distinct colorful petals. However, this temperamental flower only really blooms from April to June, so just springtime couples can utilize them in their bouquet designs. Large dahlias are a popular alternative for couples who want this face flower from mid-summer through the fall. For a hardy bloom that can ground an arrangement, floral designers also like to turn to hydrangea.  Looking for a lighter floral with movement? ""When aiming for a bouquet with a delicate fragrance and captivating beauty, Japanese Sweet Pea is a perfect choice,"" notes Strong. ""Its gentle scent and flouncy petals form a soft and feminine shape that is both timeless and romantic."" Long-stemmed anemone are fun to incorporate for a modern bouquet, while orchids are popular if a bride wants to create a cascading bouquet.  Certain flowers are more common in bouquets of a single variety. Calla lilies are an elegant, trumpet-shaped bloom often found solo and tied with a beautiful ribbon for a bridal accessory. Lily of the valley is also popular for this style of arrangement.  Photo by Lucy Cuneo  Popular Filler Flowers  While certain blooms stand out as the face flowers of a bouquet, other florals and greenery are incorporated to add dimension to these arrangements. In fact, some of these blooms can be the star of the show. ""A flower that is often underrated but can add depth and movement to arrangements is the lisianthus,"" says Strong. ""When used skillfully, the color variations in its petals allow this once-considered 'filler flower' to take on the role of a 'dancing flower,' bringing the much desired sense of movement to bouquets.""  Another popular wedding filler flower of the moment is baby's breath. With light white blooms and plenty of volume, baby's breath is commonly used throughout wedding arrangements. While normally a filler, you can find modern brides and bridesmaids carrying bouquets of this flower on its own.  For smaller blooms, carnations are commonly used as accents to a bouquet. Since they are available year-round and are quite durable, they are a safe bet to include in your arrangement. Spray roses are also a nice addition when looking for a petite floral.  ""Don't hesitate to experiment with unique textures,"" advises Strong. ""Eucalyptus can provide interesting colors and shapes, clematis adds a touch of garden charm, dates create a cascading effect, and hyacinths offer a cluster of texture and color. Embracing a variety of flowers can elevate the overall appeal of your floral designs."""

The adorable photo taken on their wedding day showed the lovebirds smiling as they embraced and shared a kiss. Meanwhile, Grande made a few alterations to the wedding photo. The Bang Bang singer wrote “2” on the black and white photo to signify how long they were married. In addition, she put a love symbol under the number. Grande also wrote “(3.5 together)” to signify how long she and Dalton Gomez have been together. According to Capital FM, Ariana Grande’s husband proposed to her about a year after they started dating in January 2020. The lovestruck media personality also wrote “I love him so” above the picture to celebrate her love for the realtor.  Dalton Gomez Is a Real Estate Agent  According to E!

The real estate agent is also musically inclined and used to dance until he moved to selling homes in California. In addition, before meeting her, Ariana Grande’s husband shared several mutual friends with her. The dog lover is friends with Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun.

This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.  “Ask Anna” is a sex column. Because of the nature of the topic, some columns contain language some readers may find graphic.  Dear Anna,  Advertisement  I’m currently planning my wedding to the wonderful man of my dreams. The process itself is less than thrilling but we’re working together as a team to tackle all the little logistical things and hurdles. A problem that I didn’t anticipate, however, is the feelings I’m having when people RSVP no — in particular, only one person from my family is coming, my sister. I love that I’ll be surrounded by friends on my big day, but I can’t help but feel hurt that my family, who I thought would show up for me, isn’t coming. I’ve certainly been invited to weddings that I wasn’t able to attend for financial or scheduling or COVID reasons, so I know it’s likely not personal, but it feels personal. How can I deal with this and focus on what truly matters — that I’m going to celebrate the love of my life? — Being Rigid In Demanding Expectations  Dear BRIDE,  Advertisement  First off, congrats on snagging the man of your dreams! It’s not everyday that you find someone worth spending your life with, so big ups to you two — I wish you every happiness.  It’s totally valid to feel hurt that people you care about can’t make it to your big day. Weddings are, in many ways, extremely loaded events and we attach way more meaning, disappointment and weight than they deserve. That’s not your fault — society tells us that this one day is THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF OUR LIVES. How can we not fall short of such a ridiculous ideal? (We can’t.)  And, really, it’s just a party. A very expensive party.  Remember also that weddings are a giant, love-fueled jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes the pieces just don’t fit perfectly for everyone. (Sometimes not even for you.)  So, how do you deal with the hurt feelings without letting it hinder the love fest that awaits you and your future spouse? Here are a few tips:  Allow yourself to grieve: Let yourself feel all the things you’re feeling. Whether you’re hurt, pissed off, depressed or perhaps all of those things at once, the fastest way to deal with feelings is to simply feel them. Don’t push them away or shove them down. Open yourself to the pain, let it core and dismantle you. Then, once the storm has finished raging inside of you, dust yourself off and keep going. Feelings are always temporary. They pass. Remembering that will help you when you’re feeling the lowest lows.  Something that helped me when I was grieving the death of my father (admittedly somewhat different than your conundrum but not entirely) was to set aside five minutes a day, in the morning usually, to just think about him. Sometimes I would journal but usually I would just ugly-cry. When I allowed myself the space to feel the full weight and depth of my agony, I was surprised at how quickly the feelings moved on. Eventually, I only had to do the ritual every other day, then once a week, and now I do it only very occasionally, on his birthday and death day. You might try a similar ritual to feel the pain and disappointment you’re experiencing around your family.  Embrace the sisterly love: Then, practice a little gratitude for the family that is coming. Your sister’s got your back and will be there to celebrate with you. That’s not nothing. Plus, you two can bond even more during this special time, which will make your relationship closer.  Advertisement  Remember other ways your fam has shown up for you: When I’m feeling especially disappointed by someone who’s important to me — and literally everyone is disappointed by their families at some point! — I try to remember all the other ways they’ve shown up for me in the past, whether it was offering encouragement, sharing time or space with me, buying a book, being there for me during a hard time or even giving me cash when I desperately needed it.  People show their love in vastly different ways at vastly different times — love isn’t a one-and-done thing. It moves. So, while it stings that this particular time certain people can’t show up for you, it doesn’t mean they never have or never will again.  It’s not you, it’s them: As you said yourself, people have their reasons for not attending, and most of the time, it has nothing to do with you. Life gets in the way, and that’s OK. Just remember that their absence doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. Tell yourself a better story.  Quality over quantity: Spend a little time fixating on the amazing friends and loved ones who are coming to your wedding. They’re the ones who’ll be dancing the night away with you, toasting with you and sharing in all your wedded bliss. That’s worth celebrating.  In queer parlance, we call them chosen family — they’re our ride-or-dies, they show up for us in the middle of the night, they bring us food when we’re sick, they read and edit our sexts, they love us unequivocally when our family or society has rejected us because of who we love or who we are. It’s a bond more powerful than blood because it’s a choice. A daily, intentional f— yes! Honor those people in your life. Let them be your family.  Virtual love: If some family members can’t physically be there, you could also consider setting up a livestream or video chat to include them in the festivities. That way, they can still share in the joy of your big day.  Advertisement  Keep perspective: At the end of the day, your wedding is a celebration of the love between you and your soon-to-be spouse. As long as you two are there, that’s what truly counts. The greatest gift of all is that you’re marrying the love of your life! And nobody can take that joy from you.  Happy planning, BRIDE!

Luckily, she later reconnected with Sam Joel at a co-worker’s going away party. Or, maybe it wasn’t luck. “A psychic had predicted this meeting, in detail, to me,” Matty shares. The psychic also told her that Matty and her soulmate had been split from the same atom and met countless times before in previous lifetimes. This lifetime was to become the one they'd got married in.  Even though she certainly knew Sam was the one, Matty didn't know the proposal was coming. “Sam is a master of surprise,” she says. “We got engaged on the rooftop garden of Sam’s cherished grandmother’s Midtown apartment in October 2018. Sam’s dad, a professional photographer, was waiting in the wings to capture the moment. When we walked back into the apartment, Sam had invited an intimate circle of family and friends to surprise me.” They celebrated with a custom menu at one of Matty’s favorite restaurants.  When it came to wedding planning, they started with what they didn’t want. “In our first meeting, I told planner Allison Jackson how important it was for our guests to feel comfortable,” Matty recalls. “I wrote out a list of everything I ever hated about going to weddings, and asked her if we could eliminate or improve on as many of those things as possible. I wanted the vibe to be Friday night at your favorite bar in New Orleans—but in the mountains. I love the aesthetic of Jack Rose, a restaurant in the Pontchartrain Hotel in New Orleans, so that’s where we had our meeting.”  The venue, at least, was a no-brainer. “The Matalin-Carville family farm—built in 1753, and bought by Matty’s parents six months before Matty was born—is where Matty and her sister spent their early years,” the couple shares. “It’s where they always gathered for the most important and special events in their lives.” The bride's wedding would be no different. From there, the couple pegged vendors who matched their creativity and enthusiasm for doing something unexpected. “We wanted to think really out-of-the-box and have a lot of fun,” they say. Of course, nods to their psychic-predicted meeting and soulmate status were woven into the celebration.  Read on to see all the playfully unique details of Matty and Sam’s November 6, 2021, wedding day, planned by Allison Jackson of Pineapple Productions and photographed by Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The palette was pulled from “colors of nature, autumnal jewel tones, and a variety of textures,” Matty says. “We love bird watching together in Audubon Park in New Orleans, so we incorporated a bird motif throughout.”  While this lead to a beautiful invitation design, getting them to guests was a challenge. They changed their date due to the pandemic, then the new invites were shipped during hurricane season in Louisiana, where many of their 250 guests reside. “Our invitation send-out unfortunately coincided with Hurricane Ida, so everyone’s mail was disrupted and many were evacuated for long periods of time. Some folks’ hard copy of the invitation arrived a month after our wedding,” Matty says. “To all future brides, I would recommend the practice of perspective and laughing at the things you just can’t control.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much, and that their presence at our wedding means so much.  Photo by Kate Headley  The personalized touches was endless, and the couple took on quite a few DIYs. “The best example would be our guest goody bags,” they say. ""We had fun cups made with our name and date; gave out copies of Matty’s grandmother’s cookbook; and even had T-shirts made that said, ‘Someone in the Shenandoah Valley Loves Me.’ Was it cheesy? Sure. Did we care? Hell no! We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much. We know things have been difficult for everyone and their presence at our wedding means that much more because of it.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  For her bridal attire, Matty paired a crepe Sarah Seven gown with an overskirt by Alexandra Grecco. “I had long been a fan of Sarah Seven; all her gowns are so chic,” the bride says. ""It was the first one I tried on, and my heart knew immediately. I paired it with the overskirt at the suggestion of my sister—the most stylish person I know—and I fell in love with the combo. The other key was trying it on with the cathedral-length veil. I also wore a bow from my mother’s wedding gown, which she hand-sewed onto the back of my skirt.”  Matty's makeup look was effortlessly beautiful, with hair was inspired by her mother. “My mom wore a Vera Wang headband on her wedding day, and I wanted to mirror that with a white headband that I had [our florist] decorate with fresh flowers,” Matty says. “It felt really glam and fun, and my hair was out of my face so I could dance all night.”  Photo by Kate Headley  “The best, best accessory was the homemade flower crowns my cousin made for all the kids,” Matty shares. “Her daughter was one of our flower girls, and she was sure to model it like a pro and show the other kids how to wear it with enthusiasm. We also had cute little signs for our kiddos to wear down the aisle—things like, ‘I’m just here for the cake!’ and ‘Has anyone seen the rings?’ It added levity and humor in a serious moment.”  Photo by Kate Headley  As guests entered the ceremony space, they were greeted with warm spiked local apple cider and savory parmesan rosemary shortbread. “The focal point of our ceremony decor was the floating chuppah, which was designed by Amaryllis Floral & Event Design. The die-cut wood chuppah frame was suspended from the poles of our sailcloth tent,” Matty describes. ""The corners of the chuppah were adorned with silk ribbons. During our ceremony, special friends and family members pinned photos of lost loved ones to the ribbons.” To make the event more intimate and inclusive, they set their ceremony in the round.  Photo by Kate Headley  Matty’s dad, James Carville—a well-known political strategist, commentator, and author—walked her down the aisle to the sounds of “Stand by Me” strummed by a string quartet. Her mother, meanwhile, looked very chic in pink. “She wore a Carolina Herrera dress and accessorized it with an Oscar de la Renta boa and vintage Givenchy opera coat,” Matty says. “She also carried a small posy of roses and dahlias, accented with peacock feathers, a symbol of good luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  There was no first look, as the bride and groom wanted to see each ofter for the first time at the ends of the aisle. “It was amazing,” Matty shares. “I got the teary-eyed photo of Sam under the chuppah that I always wanted!” During the ceremony, “I loved sharing our Jewish faith traditions with Matty’s Catholic family, and I loved that they loved it,” Sam says. “I’m also so glad we wrote our own vows. We really said everything we needed to say [and] made promises we’re excited to keep. To me, that’s the best way to start life together.”  Guests tossed birdseed and confetti at the newlyweds as they retreated down the aisle. “Our recessional was a traditional hymn, but it morphed into ‘Jambalaya (On the Bayou)’ by Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ray Charles, which my dad arranged as a surprise on our wedding day,” Matty says. “Guests were dancing down the aisle as they made their way out of the tent to the cocktail hour.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  The newlyweds traversed the property to enjoy the first few moments as husband and wife, and took portraits with their photographer Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “An oversized wooden wagon held candles and soaps my mother made in the months leading up to our wedding day for each guest,” Matty says. Guests filled swag bags and snapped photos in a vintage trailer during cocktail hour, while a Cajun zydeco band created a festive atmosphere. “We had a variety of signature cocktails inspired by our family and friends,” Matty says. “We clipped fortunes to cocktails and served them with tarot card coasters as a fun nod to our psychic-predicted meeting.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We melded NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of the Shenandoah Valley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The reception tent decor was inspired by Jack Rose, the New Orleans restaurant where they’d had that first meeting with their planner. “Allison suggested we approach the design by melding NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley,” Matty says. “Our tent was draped in rich textured peacock-blue fabric and finished at the top with a patterned valance. Wrought-iron and gold-leaf lanterns with pillar candles, Southern smilax, and dripping jewel-toned flowers filled the ceiling of the tent for a whimsical and lush look.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “A large oval mahogany bar featured decorative panels with a bold coordinating print,” Matty continues. “The center of the bar housed a large shelving unit filled with botanicals and curiosities—even a peacock, which is a known omen foretelling success and luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  The bandstand was created from a wooden wall painted brick red and decorated with disco balls and a neon sign reading “You Belong Here.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Their semi-naked cake was adorned with sugar flowers, fresh figs, and Seckel pears—and there were more treats, as well. “Our groom’s cake was a delicious loaf of challah surrounded by honeycomb and fresh figs. Southern sweets like Mississippi mud bars and lemon squares rounded out the dessert menu.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Dinner was an homage to New Orleans. “Roasted outside our tent in an antique trailer, traditional cajun-style whole suckling pig was served at a butcher-block table with local apple chutney,” Matty says. There was also jambalaya, New Orleans roast beef debris, and blackened redfish. The couple even served a famous salad recipe pulled from the Carville family cookbook.  Photo by Kate Headley  The duo had their first dance to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” then the party got going. “Reaching out for Sam’s hand and looking over the crowd together when we were lifted up for the hora, I thanked my lucky stars for the health and presence of everyone there,” Matty shares of her most cherished moment from the day. “I tried to just melt into the blessings around me.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Fireworks erupted as a surprise grand finale to the evening, while chicken sliders and paper cones of tater tots were passed around. Looking back on the day, Matty has some advice for other to-be-weds. “Be bold, lead with kindness, politely ask for what you want, and cultivate your own style and infuse that into your wedding in a way that genuinely celebrates the love you have for your partner, your family, and your guests,” she says. “Also, trust the professionals—you’ll be blown away by their creativity.”"

All was made clear on the season 13 finale of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Tuesday, which saw Melissa share the ""big secret"" she said she's been keeping to herself the last six months.  Opening up the morning after the finale party, Melissa said that it all started with the rumor that Melissa was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband in the backseat of a car.  ""For the last six months, I've been trying to keep this big secret, because I was doing everything in my power to keep the family together,"" Melissa says.  ""I didn't want to say anything, because I was scared that they were going to ruin my wedding,"" Teresa goes on to claim.  The episode then flashes back to the night of Dolores Catania's Irish-themed, 1920s ""prohibition"" party, where everything came to a head.  Danielle Cabral breaks the news to Melissa that Margaret Josephs' former friend, Laura Jensen, told Jennifer Aydin and Teresa that Margaret has dirt on Melissa, claiming she was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband. It's then that Melissa stops Danielle and tells her she's already heard this story... from her own husband.  ""You wanna know how I heard it through my husband? 'Cause his sister called him over to her house secretly without me to tell him this story behind my back. Pretty f**ked up sister-in-law I have, isn't it?"" Melissa fires back.  The longtime RHONJ star proceeded to break things down in a confessional, calling the rumor ""baseless.""  ""Six months ago, Teresa called Joe over with Louie, because she heard a rumor about me, and she believes it so much, that she had to call her brother over. How dare you tell my husband that I would cheat on him?"" Melissa asks. ""You're saying this off a baseless rumor, from some woman who wants to hurt Margaret with no facts. No anything. Did she think he was just going to pack his bags and leave? Like, what the f**k are you doing?""  Fired up and frustrated at this point, Melissa tells Danielle that she should've called both Melissa and Teresa over to have this conversation. Danielle is confused by Melissa's claim that Teresa would want the cheating rumor to be true -- it becomes clear then that maybe Danielle isn't too well-versed in the years-long back-and-forth between Melissa and her sister-in-law.  ""Are you kidding me? Doll face, look at me. I have been accused of being a stripper. I have been accused of doing stuff in parking lots before,"" Melissa says. ""She's said multiple times, 'Your wife will leave you for a richer man.' She's said multiple things that we have let go in our life.""  Melissa shares that she had no intention of confronting Teresa about the meeting or the rumor because Joe himself doesn't believe it.  ""It's bulls**t and because I wanted to let her have a peaceful six months leading up to her wedding,"" Melissa says in a confessional. ""And look what ends up happening: she has her minion make me look bad in front of everyone, so everyone can hear the words 'Melissa's a cheater,' and I am done.""  Demanding to know why Teresa called Joe to the house to tell him about the alleged cheating, Melissa asks her sister-in-law for an explanation.  ""First of all, it wasn't his sister. It was Louie. He was like, 'I wanna tell your brother that all this is coming from Margaret, so your brother can get in front of it,'"" Teresa claims in a confessional. ""So, he was looking out for my brother. And I never repeated it to anymore.""  At this point, the entire party is heated, with fights breaking out amongst nearly everyone on the cast. The group begins to separate into their couples as they unpack what just happened. After getting the play-by-play from Melissa, Joe sets things straight in a confessional.  ""I get a call from Louie, 'What are ya doin'? I need to see you right away. It's very important.' So, I go to her house and Louie says, 'We heard that Melissa cheated on you.' I go, 'Guys, you got the wrong girl,'"" Joe tells the cameras.  Melissa starts to believe the altercation was all a set-up and tells the cameras that she thinks Teresa knew Danielle was going to tell her at the party.  After more back-and-forth and a heated argument between Joe and Louie, the group disbands, with everyone starting to make their way home for the night.  It's now the morning after the party and Melissa calls Dolores to go over the night's events, it's then she shares that she and Joe won't be going to Teresa and Louie's wedding.  ""Dolores, how can I go and celebrate someone else's marriage when they are the people that are constantly trying to destroy mine?"" Melissa says. ""I'm not doing it.""  Dolores tells Melissa if they don't go to the wedding, then she and Joe's relationship with Teresa is ""over-over,"" to which Melissa replies, ""It's been over.""  Already on the way to Teresa's house, Dolores tells Melissa that she plans to tell Teresa about her decision to skip the wedding. And she does just that, breaking the news to the couple, who are just days away from getting married.  ""They hate us,"" Teresa says after finding out about Melissa's decision. ""Obviously, they're not happy for us... This has been going on over 10 years. I dealt with it with my ex, I'm not going to deal with it in my new chapter of my life. I'm so done.""  Later in a confessional, Teresa says that she doesn't want a family ""like that,"" if this is the way things are going to be.  ""I know she's been wanting to get my brother away from me all this time,"" Teresa says of Melissa. ""She got her wish. She got her wish.""  The season ends with Melissa and Teresa in a worse place than viewers have seen them to date, signaling that things between this family may really be ""over-over.""  The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.

That is to say: It is not the story of the real Queen Charlotte. “It is not a history lesson,” the statement continues. “It is fiction inspired by fact. All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional.” And while that is certainly the case—no one can truly know what went on in Charlotte and King George III’s relationship—some parts of the show actually are true to life. This is particularly the case when it comes to Queen Charlotte’s wedding.  Queen Charlotte shows a 17-year-old Princess Charlotte being quickly married off to a 22-year-old King George, leaving her home in Germany and getting married the same day she arrived. That all actually happened. Here are some more details about the real royal wedding as they compare to the hit Netflix show.  Charlotte’s journey to England was pretty accurately depicted.  On the show, British royal representatives arrive in Mirow, the dukedom in northern Germany where Charlotte lived as Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her brother, Adolphus, signs the contract for Charlotte to marry King George III. Adolphus then makes the journey to England with Charlotte.  This is all true to life, but some details were missing. The official British royal family website explains that the escorts who arrived in Germany to collect Charlotte were led by the Earl of Harcourt. According to the site, the group didn’t leave right away. Instead, they were three days of celebrations, and then they returned to England with Charlotte where she would begin her new life.    While Queen Charlotte shows the future queen complaining of her uncomfortable outfit and whale bone corset, the journey was actually hard for a different reason. The royal family site notes that the voyage was difficult and the group faced three storms while crossing the North Sea. It also was a very long trip: They left Germany on August 17 and didn’t get to London until September 8.  While Charlotte and Adolphus are traveling, he mentions that their parents have died. This was also true, and the death of their mother was very recent—she had died only three months earlier.  Charlotte got married the same day she arrived.  Queen Charlotte shows Charlotte and George getting married the same day that she arrives in England. And as surprising as it may seem, this is what actually happened.  “At 9:00 p.m. the same evening, within six hours of arrival, the wedding of Princess Charlotte and King George III took place at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace,” the royal family site reads.  The show features a confrontation on the wedding day between Charlotte and George’s mother, Princess Augusta, in which they argue about Charlotte’s wedding dress—she wants to wear the one she had made in Paris; Augusta wants her to wear an English-style dress. According to the Washington Post, the real George had requested that gowns be made for Charlotte and be ready when she arrived.  According to Percy Fitzgerald’s book, The Good Queen Charlotte (per Town & Country), for her wedding Charlotte “wore ‘an endless mantle’ of rich violet and purple velvet, lined with ermine, over a white satin and silver dress.” In the show, she does wear a silver and white gown—just without the purple velvet addition.  As for what wasn’t based on history...  A key part of the show is the fact that Charlotte is Black and the royal court becomes integrated thanks to her becoming queen. In reality, while there has been speculation that Charlotte had African ancestry, most historians agree that this idea lacks evidence and isn’t accurate. Instead, the show takes this idea and runs with it, which makes for an interesting story, but it means that the real wedding didn’t actually feature all the non-white members of the ton being invited to the royal wedding at the last minute.  As for other exaggerated or made-up moments, those are probably pretty obvious. Did Charlotte actually try to escape her fate as the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by climbing over a fence? Probably not, but it did make for a charming royal meet-cute with Farmer George."

Doctor and TikToker Justin Tyler Fox gained over 9.1 million views, 2.3 million likes and 20,000 comments when he uploaded the wedding day confession to his account.  However, while many wedding day videos go viral for rather upsetting reasons — like the bride who served her guests $48 bottles of antibloat pills at the reception, or the groom whose “disgusting” wedding vows set off red flags all across TikTok — Justin’s wedding day footage is making a positive impact on TikTok by touching people’s hearts (and raising the bar for vows from here on out).  Fox begins his viral vows by asking his bride, Raven, “Do you remember the day I knew for a fact I was going to marry you?” He then recalls the story for all their family and friends — and now, for all the TikTok viewers at home.  According to Justin, he decided to marry Raven after a very special hiking trip — and after her fateful fall attempting to follow him across a river.  When she took the nasty fall, he knew this was someone who would follow him to any place on earth, someone who would be by his side on every adventure and challenge.  Thus, to capture this very special moment, Justin secretly took a part of that day — and a part of Raven — and had it tucked away inside her ring.  Later, after proposing to Raven and putting the ring on her finger, she asked him, “What is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?”  Justin recalled explaining to her, “I told you, ‘No, that’s the way it’s supposed to be,’ and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day. Here’s my confession. That little stone in your ring is made out of dentine and enamel.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.  It’s wedding season, y’all. That means you’re going to have to pony up and buy that flight to that oddly remote destination your friend picked for their wedding two and a half hours from the nearest airport. Great venue choice, Bud!  For many people, wedding season can come as an embarrassing experience of wearing the same navy suit and tie you’ve had since high school graduation. Well, let me tell you, bro: It’s time to step up your game. Whether you’re going solo in hopes of meeting a bridesmaid or attending as a plus one to the event, you need to look your best. Fortunately, we’ve done the research to help you figure out what to wear as a plus-one to a wedding if you don’t want to look like every other person there.  Advice on Matching Your Date: If you’re going with a date, you should complement them, but avoid matching their look exactly—this isn’t your high school prom. If your date is wearing a certain color, choose accessories in similar or complementary shades or tones. For example, if your date is wearing a navy blue dress, opt for a different shade of blue, like sky or teal. If they are wearing pink or red, wear blue or green so that you complement each other but still look great when separated. And if they are wearing white, well then you wear whatever they told you to wear.  Try using a color wheel to match clothes and follow these few steps:  Choose one dominant color for your event outfit. Now, this could be a color that compliments your skin tone or just a color that you like to wear. Find the complementary color on a color wheel. This is the color opposite your dominant color on the wheel. Look for comparable colors on the color wheel. These could be the colors next to your dominant color or down the line in terms of shade. These analogous colors will help create a cohesive and harmonious look for your getup. Lastly, consider using neutral colors such as black, white, gray, or beige to balance out your outfit and leave room for small bits of flare.

The development speaks to an 872% increase in searches for handmade gifts on Etsy, indicative of a significant shift away from mass-produced items. The new platform, a game-changer for small businesses, is now live and accessible at Etsy.com/Registry.  What sets Etsy Registry apart is its support for independent creators and small businesses. It facilitates the selection of handmade, vintage, and personalized items, allowing couples to outline the precise customization they want. This makes Etsy a one-stop-shop for not only gifts, but also wedding decor and bridal party items.  Antoni Porowski, TV personality, and his fiancé Kevin Harrington have endorsed the platform, curating their own gift registry filled with unique items from worldwide makers. “One of the best parts about registering with Etsy is that you can choose custom, personalized gifts that never feel cookie cutter,” shares Antoni, hinting at the fun they had in curating their unique list of wedding items.  Alongside the launch of Etsy Registry, Etsy has also released its annual 2023 wedding trend guide. This year, couples are placing importance on fun and creativity, with unique twists on tradition taking center stage. Themes, elaborate programs, and unconventional bridal looks and rings are all part of the mix, adding to the excitement of saying “I do”.  Among the 2023 wedding trends identified by Etsy are Lovecore, Oversized florals, Western weddings, Love story gifts, and Rings with character. Lovecore sees an influx of heart patterns, roses, and red and pink hues, while Oversized florals incorporate rosettes and floral appliqués to add texture and romance. Western weddings bring a laid-back, unconventional style, and Love story gifts promote personalized mementos that celebrate each couple’s unique journey. Rings with character is a trend that showcases individuality, with handmade, unique rings gaining popularity over traditional designs.  For small businesses in the wedding industry, these trends provide a roadmap for product development and marketing. It opens avenues for those skilled in crafting handmade and personalized items, floral designs, or western-themed goods to tap into a growing market. Similarly, businesses specializing in love story gifts can hone their product range and marketing strategies based on the current trends, attracting more customers seeking unique, meaningful presents.  It’s important to note that this shift toward personalized and meaningful wedding items isn’t just a trend, but a sign of a larger movement towards conscious consumption. As consumers become more aware of their purchases’ impacts, they’re turning towards small businesses and independent creators who offer unique, handmade, and personalized items. The success of Etsy Registry could pave the way for a more diverse, personalized, and meaningful wedding gift industry, providing a significant boost to small businesses worldwide.  It’s clear that Etsy Registry is more than just a platform; it’s a statement on the future of the wedding industry. With its focus on personalization, creativity, and support for small businesses, Etsy is reshaping the way we think about wedding gifts and decor. And for small businesses, it’s an opportunity to connect with customers on a deeper level, offering products that are not only beautiful but meaningful as well.

(Valley News Live) - Casey Ford and his fiance Allison Torkelson are set to get married in September, but never could they imagine they would be forced to find a new venue and caterer, just months before the wedding.  Ford says, last February, he and his soon-to-be wife coordinated with Bigfoot Bar and Grill, which was operated out of the Ramada Inn in Grand Forks, to plan their wedding. He says they wrote out a $1,400 deposit check to Bigfoot to secure catering and the use of the Ramada Inn banquet hall.  “They cashed it two to three weeks after that. Everything was fine. The communication was fine,” said Ford.  Although, everything did not turn out fine. Ford says he learned from social media that the business had closed.  “I found out on Facebook that they are splitting ways with Ramada. There was no communication there. I emailed them again saying, I found out through Facebook that you are splitting up. What’s the deal,” he said.  Ford says he learned of the closing through a posting on a Facebook group. The posting was from another soon-to-bride, who was having the same issue. Several screenshots were attached showing the woman’s many attempts to also contact Bigfoot to determine the fate of her wedding. The post accumulated more than 60 comments from others going through the same problem or those who have had less-than-desirable interactions with the business.  He also says there have been several attempts to contact Bigfoot’s owner since learning of the closure, but there has been little to no response.  “I’ve tried calling. I’ve tried emailing. My dad has been doing things on his end in Grand Forks to try and get in contact and we’ve just heard nothing.”  Not only was the couple out $1,400, they also had to find a new venue. All he wants now is to have the money refunded.  “It doesn’t feel good. $1,400 is a lot of money. That could go towards our wedding at the new place,” Ford said. “Having to find out through a third-party source that they are splitting and we don’t have a wedding. Don’t have a location and we had to go to other venues. That 1,400 would mean a lot.”  Google listed Bigfoot as permanently closed. Also, when visiting the business website, the word “closed” is plastered across the homepage.  According to an article from the Winnipeg Free Press, Bigfoot’s owner Ty Cox was facing deportation from Canada in 2014 after he allegedly scammed a charity for kids out of $7,200. It’s unclear if he was ever actually deported.  A representative from Ramada Inn confirmed Bigfoot was no longer operating in their hotel. The representative says they were not made aware of the full list of weddings scheduled. Although, they state the hotel will honor the commitment to host some weddings in certain situations.  If there are couples who have coordinated their weddings with Bigfoot and still wish to host their event at the Ramada, you can contact Assistant Manager Tiffany at (701) 203-1714.  Our requests for comment from the owner of Bigfoot Bar and Grill have gone unanswered.  Copyright 2023 KVLY. All rights reserved."

It will be a small wedding, and we want to invite two of our mutual friends who are married to each other. We mostly knew them as a monogamous couple, but since we moved to another state, they have become part of a polycule. We love our friends, and want everyone at this intimate gathering to feel comfortable. We’ve never met the two newest people in their relationship, but they all seem to be getting more serious about each other. Should we invite just the two friends, or the whole polycule? How do we know when a +1 should actually be a +2 or +3?  A:  Hello! Fellow queer person currently planning a wedding here and experiencing intermittent guest list stress, so I am answering from that perspective! The simplified version of my answer is this: Basically, you can treat these friends the same way as you treat other friends who have maybe started new relationships where you don’t know their partners. Are you automatically inviting all of your monogamously partnered friends’ partners even if you’ve never met them before or don’t really have your own friendships with them? Then it might be the most “fair” to consider inviting these friends’ partners. If you have left off some friend’s partners who you don’t know, then it’s fine to leave these ones off, too, regardless of how serious the relationship is.  My slightly more complicated (or perhaps liberating for you — idk!) answer is that you can invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. A lot of “guest list” etiquette is outdated when it comes to +1s — and I don’t mean in the sense that obviously old and heteronormative rules don’t take into account polycules or poly relationship structures but just in the sense that +1s in general don’t always need to be the default. Not everyone on the guest list for my wedding gets a +1 — even for some folks who are monogamously partnered! My fiancé and I basically went with our own personal “rules” for +1s, which weren’t codified rules at all but just rather who we thought it made the most sense to invite. We have some friends who are newer to our lives, and it just didn’t make a ton of sense for us to invite their partners who we’ve never met. We have some friends who we spend a ton of time with who never really bring their partners around, so in some of those cases, we also didn’t feel bad about not extending +1s. I have cousins in Norway who are invited who are married or otherwise in longterm partnerships whose partners are not invited, which I knew would be especially chill because Norwegians think Americans are kinda extra with all the +1 stuff at weddings.  The size of your guest list is the #1 determining factor for the cost of your wedding — full stop. I don’t think anyone understands this until they’ve planned a wedding themselves (myself included!), but the smallest adjustments to size can make a huge difference. It’s not “just a few extra people” in a lot of cases; it automatically makes the price of food, drink, programs, etc go up. And if you’re planning a small wedding, then it makes it all the more true that small fluctuations would have a big impact. The thing that really stands out to me is that you’ve never met these other people in the polycule. Except in a few very rare cases, my fiancé and I aren’t inviting anyone who hasn’t been met by at least one of us.  Every time I experienced stress while working on our guest list, I had a helpful friend who reminded me that there’s no way to make everyone happy; you should focus on making yourselves happy. No one should be invited to a wedding solely because you feel socially obligated to do so. You have to come up with whatever “rules” make the most sense for you — and they can be amorphous like ours ultimately were.  Of course, no one should feel excluded just because they choose a polyamorous approach to their relationships. Ask yourself this though: If these two people who you’re both friends with had recently broken up and were now seriously dating new people, would you invite those new partners? If any of your monogamous friends broke up and started seeing new people, would you invite those new people, too? If the answer is yes without a doubt, then sure, go ahead and invite their full polycule. If the answer is no or you’re unsure, then maybe remind yourselves that what really matters is the people you’re closest to are at your special day, and sometimes that doesn’t include everyone those people are also close to.  Also, something that’s helpful to keep in mind is that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with guest +1s being on, for lack of a better phrase, a “backup list.” If you have enough people decline when they RSVP to your wedding, then perhaps you can add in extra +1s — either for these friends or for other friends who are in new relationships or even for single friends who you think might benefit from a date. In general, my guest list has what I call a “no randos” policy, which basically means no blanket +1s for folks — except in a few individual cases where I know the person invited ONLY knows me and my fiancé and I wanted them to have a buddy. See, this is what I mean by amorphous rules! Be flexible and not overly constrained by etiquette, which can be super rigid!  I totally understand the impulse of wanting to make sure your approach to social expectations are inclusive and fair, but I also think it’s okay to play by your own rules when it comes to a wedding and go with your instincts. So long as the decision is being made from a place of what you actually want and not what you think others expect of you, I think whatever choice you make is ultimately yours and doesn’t have to be defended to anyone. The fact that you’re asking this question in the first place signals to me that you take your friends’ relationships seriously.  You can chime in with your advice in the comments and submit your own questions any time."

Olivia Wilde broke the cardinal rule of dressing for a wedding when she attended Colton Underwood and Jordan C. Brown’s nuptials over the weekend.

The unconventional style choice still caused a stir on social media, with one person tweeting, “Olivia Wilde showing up to her friend’s wedding in a white silk wedding gown is… desperate.”  Wilde shared an Instagram Story with the two grooms.

The key to finding just the right look? Skip stilettos in favor of flat sandals and go for the best beach wedding guest dresses that are wearable and refined at once.  “Look for styles that are flowy, made with lightweight fabrics like linen and viscose to help to keep you cool, and that you can dance on the beach in all night,” Suzanne Smallshaw, senior director of fashion and styling at , tells Bazaar. “If you’re looking for a more form-fitting dress, opt for one with breathable stretch, so you’re comfortable from the afternoon ceremony to sunset cocktails.”  Don’t be afraid to lean into bold, bright designs. In fact, Smallshaw suggests looking to mood-boosting spring 2023 trends for inspiration. “Opt for vibrant colors, seasonal prints, and interesting details or cutouts to show off a little skin,” she says. “Playful pleats, sunset-inspired hues, and mermaid-esque silhouettes are top themes this summer that would also play wonderfully in a beach wedding setting.”  Attending a black-tie seaside ceremony? Try a floor-length slipdress in a bright graphic print. If the invite specifies semiformal or cocktail attire, go for a dreamy puff-sleeve maxi or an ornate lace mini with a slightly relaxed fit. To enhance the vibe of your beach-chic look, Smallshaw suggests adding timeless, beachy touches like straw bags, gold jewelry, and pearls.  Whether you’re staying local or traveling to faraway shores, I did the research and tapped Smallshaw’s expertise to find the 25 best beach wedding guest dresses for every kind of seaside ceremony. Now, all that’s left to do is enjoy the salty breeze on your skin and bask in the sunshine."

The Real Housewives of New Jersey star is finally walking down the aisle in Bravo's preview of their May 23 special Teresa Gets Married. While her and Luis ""Louie"" Ruelas' nuptials, which were filmed in August, is supposed to be the happiest day of their lives, their nasty feud with her brother Joe Gorga and sister-in-law Melissa Gorga might just overshadow their joy.  As her RHONJ co-star Margaret Josephs states in the teaser, ""All I can think of is we're all here and Melissa and Joe are not.""  Even though the couple chose to skip the wedding because of the bad blood, their presence was still felt at the ceremony. In fact, at one point an enraged Louie explodes with, ""If these f--king people put out one more message on Instagram I swear to god I'm going to f--king bury them so bad.""  The drama even brought Teresa to tears as she was getting the finishing touches done on her now-infamous sky-high $10,000 hair finished for the event.

Dorothy ""Dottie"" Fideli, 77, celebrated her love for herself with a unique wedding ceremony at her retirement community, O'Bannon Terrace in Goshen, on Saturday, according to NBC affiliate WLWT and Today.  Fideli told NBC affiliate KCEN that she was ""nervous"" but ""excited"" for the big day.  ""This is something new for me,"" she told the outlet. ""It's emotional for me, because this is something I've always wanted.""  Fideli was once married in a brief courthouse ceremony in 1965, but they divorced nine years later.  ""I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,"" she told Today.  Although she told the outlet she worried it might be ""too late"" to have the wedding of her dreams, one day she had a change of heart.  ""I have been with myself for 40 years,"" she said according to KCEN, adding that while she was at church she realized she wanted to ""do something special"" for herself.

And after spending much of her life taking care of her children and grandchildren, Fideli is excited that life is ""about me now,"" according to Today. ""It's my turn to do what I want to do.""  Fideli's daughter, Donna Pennington, helped her mother find a dress, cooked food for the event and even decorated the retirement home's community room with a balloon arch and other items.  ""I told my daughter, I said, 'This is the best thing that I've ever had, outside of having you kids,'"" Fideli told Today. ""This is what I've always wanted and I'm so happy that you (gave) it to me."""

Each day this week, we’ll be asking our resident “Wediquette” expert and “Let Them Eat Cake” editor Melanie Spencer a frequently asked question or one from a reader.  Yesterday, we started the week off with a topic that can be tricky to navigate for many – money. Click here to see if there is a minimum amount to spend on a wedding present.  Today, we’re covering a big fashion pet peeve of ours surrounding wedding guests.  Question: How much is too much white in a wedding outfit? Can I wear white shoes/white purse/accessories?  Answer: It’s OK if an outfit has some white in it. What we want to avoid is attire that’s more white than any other color. So, for example, a blue dress with white flowers is fine. But it would be best to avoid a white dress with blue flowers. This guideline is mainly about steering clear of upstaging the couple getting married, since traditionally at least one person often wears a white dress, pantsuit or what have you. When it comes to accessories, I would err on the side of no white (for shoes and purse especially), because if one or more person in the betrothed couple is wearing white, they will likely also use white accessories and, again, it’s best to avoid anything that could smack of upstaging. All of this being said, if the couple instructs guests to wear white (or any specific color), definitely do as they request, because they are clearly going for a look and a vibe and you don’t want to be ‘that guy’."

Focus on what you want to use and see every day.  Much conversation surrounds the wedding itself — the prep and planning for the Big Day and the related festivities are the topics du jour as couples consider the various elements of their union. But the wedding is the start of something new, and there should be some careful consideration of your life at home — whether it’s what items to register for or how to “marry” interior design aesthetics.  Whether you move in together before or after “I do,” you’re bound to have too much of one thing, too little of another — and some items that have to go. “Taking both aesthetics and blending them together is important,” says Maureen Block, of Mason Grey Interiors in Newtown Square. “This is a new space that should reflect both personalities. Everyone should feel comfortable at home.” Here are Block’s tricks for settling in.  If you’re looking for more planning advice, check out our guides to nontraditional bouquets, stocking an N/A wedding bar, managing wedding stress, budgeting, size-inclusive wedding attire, and more.  1. Take inventory of everything. Knowing what you both have helps you see what you may need.  2. Know what the long-term shared goal for each area is. Making and agreeing on a plan to proceed room by room or space by space is key.  3. Set a budget, and don’t be afraid of using a designer. It’s an investment, but it can help save time and money in the long run. But remember, communication in any relationship is key — especially  with your designer.  4. Consider your non-negotiables. Maybe it’s an oversize recliner that one of you must have but the other hates. Rather than arguing, design around it with great pillows or art pieces to draw the eye away.  5. When it comes to your registry, only bring into your home what you really love. Focus on the pieces you want to use and see every day.  What’s the Best Registry For …  COZY-CHIC HOUSEWARES?  Head to Anthropologie in Rittenhouse. The store’s eclectic lineup of bedding and functional but fun cookware often gets overlooked for its clothing selection, but who doesn’t need a cake stand shaped like a lily pad?  CONSCIOUS ART?  Try South Kensington nonprofit InLiquid. The organization’s new registry­ lets couples curate a selection of pieces from Philly artists at a variety of price points and styles. (Email Sara Zimmerman at saraz@inliquid.org to register.)  GIFTS FROM A GROUP?  Best for a couple that already has a home full of practical items — Ilyan Jewelry in Haverford has plenty of sparkle. Perhaps your wedding party wants to go in on a chic charm to commemorate the day.  Published as “Expert Advice” in the winter/spring 2023 issue of Philadelphia Wedding."

However, one woman said she pulled off her perfect day at a great price by hiring an unlikely caterer: Chili’s.  In a viral video, user @brideisapersonality explained how having Chili’s as her caterer saved her a ton of money.  “We served Chili’s at our wedding and this is how much we spent,” the TikToker began the video.  In the background, she holds a receipt that features what the total was and everything she served to guests, including chips and salsa, salad, egg rolls, cajun chicken pasta, chicken tenders, sliders.  “Our total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests,” she said. “This also includes five specialty meals that we did for people who were gluten-free, dairy-free, and can’t eat meat, and people who needed special items like no dairy, only seafood, etc.”  While the TikToker was thoroughly impressed with the price point for all of the food, she said she did run into unexpected hurdles. “We had to pick it up pretty early because we didn’t want to pay the delivery fees,” she continued.  The TikToker said her wedding day also fell on St. Patrick’s Day, and the restaurant prepared the food ahead of time to ensure the entire order could be fulfilled. This meant the food had to be rewarmed and set up by the bride, her family, and the servers she hired to wait on guests and help clean up.  “We had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be like cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking. My coordinator had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn’t really supposed to do,” the TikToker said. “That was just a lot more work than we had anticipated.”  Nonetheless, the TikToker said she was still happy with her choice.  “The food was amazing,” she concluded. “It was the perfect meal for our wedding.”  Her video was viewed over 1.3 million times. Some viewers criticized the bride for not simply having the food delivered and expecting her servers to do additional, unexpected labor. “I’m all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,” user @mars wrote. “You should have paid delivery.”  However, others applauded the bride’s decision to go with a cost-effective option that still makes guests happy.  “Normalize this,” a commenter wrote. “Weddings are so out of control! Such a great idea!”  “I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was Chili’s,” one user commented.  Chili’s also eventually chimed in with a simple comment on the bride’s video: “Iconic.”  The Daily Dot reached out to @brideisapersonality and Chili’s for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication."

Example video title will go here for this video  GLASTONBURY, Conn. — Spring is here and that means it’s officially wedding season.  The wedding industry is seeing a huge boost in business after the COVID-19 pandemic wrecked wedding plans for brides across the state.  Now venues are just catching up with their rescheduled weddings from the pandemic, and while life feels back to normal, the wedding industry has changed completely.  Before you say ""I do,"" you may find yourself as a bridesmaid instead of a bride.  ""We have more than we can handle, more than we could want, we turn people away but we give suggestions on where they can go,"" said Corrine Crocker-Luby, owner of the Tiffany Juliet House.  Finding a place to tie the knot is more stressful than ever before. Some brides are already booking into 2026.  Over at Glastonbury Hills Country Club, co-owner Frank Schroll said wedding dates are booking up years in advance.  ""We even get some brides that aren’t even engaged yet, they come out they know it's gonna happen soon and they want to do the leg work,"" said Schroll.  That leg work is harder than in years past.  All those pandemic-postponed ceremonies and receptions have backed up the bookings at venues around the country. All pieces and parts of the wedding industry are hoping brides and grooms have some flexibility.  ""We don’t want to hear brides have one date because more than likely it will already be taken,"" said Schroll.  That’s exactly what happened to Shannon Dolan.  ""I was thinking wedding planning starting about a year in advance was going to be fine but quickly we were learning some of the vendors were already booked,"" said Dolan.  Last summer, she found out “I do” is already planning to be said for every date for this October.  She decided on an unconventional approach to her big day. It's her own new booming business, the Mix and Mingle Mobile Bar. The drinks come to you, allowing brides to choose their wedding day in their favorite spot, on a budget. October it is for her big day, just with fewer guests than originally planned.  ""We’ve been to some weddings that are smaller guest counts and they’re some of the most fun weddings we’ve been to,"" said Dolan.  More weddings means post-pandemic love is in the air.  Back at the Tiffany Juliet House, owner Crocker-Luby has also been a wedding planner for more than two decades, now watching some relationships running right to the altar.  ""People are actually falling in love more after Covid and celebrating their union,"" said Crocker-Luby.  That means while it may be harder to lock down a time and place, couples are still celebrating their love, sometimes with just a big guest list cut.  ""After the pandemic people wanted to get together with their families so now we’re seeing a lot more intimate gatherings,"" said Tamie Myers, owner of Event Connoisseur Flowers and Gifts.  No matter the size, what’s a wedding with out flowers?  Myers' wedding business is, well, blooming.  ""Business is booming and people are looking to get back out there and have the interactions with their friends and family again,"" said Myers.  Brides and grooms are keeping the industry on its toes, trying to celebrate like normal is back in vogue.  ""I think we were cooped up too long for sure and it’s remembering what’s important in life and spending time with people you love,"" said Crocker-Luby.  Couples are finally surrounded again by family and friends, having their cake, and eating it too.  Lindsey Kane is a reporter at FOX61 News. She can be reached at Lkane@fox61.com.

Though wine on its own can make a great gift—especially if it means something unique to the couple—it’s nice to pair the bottle with something extra special. Fortunately, we’re here to help take some of the stress out of the gift-giving process with plenty of expert tips.  First, you’ll need to pick a great bottle of booze. “Giving a bottle from a vintage from the year the newlyweds met or got engaged is a fun idea and shows that you also pay attention to the milestones in their relationship,” says Janice Carnevale, event planner and wedding expert with Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C. “A custom case for them to open over several anniversaries would [also] be an incredibly thoughtful gift.”  Next, you’ll want to determine what else you plan to gift the guests of honor. “Most often, we see wine given as part of a wedding gift, often accompanied by a gift of cash or sometimes accompanied by wine glasses,” says Sara Bauleke, wedding planner and designer at Bella Notte in Washington, D.C.  But before you begin browsing, be sure to check the couple’s registry to see if they have listed any wine-centric items, suggests Carnevale. “They might have glassware, a [wine] opener or a chiller on their list, which would pair great with a bottle you pick for them,” she says.  Finally, as you search for the perfect wine-centric gift for the bride and groom-to-be, consider how much you want to shell out.  “Generally speaking, couples will expect gifts in various price ranges depending on their financial situation,” says Jacqueline Vizcaino founder of Tinted Events Design and Planning in Atlanta.  Cathy O’Connell, co-founder of COJ Events in La Quinta, California, recommends spending somewhere between $100 to $200 or more, but staying in the range of what you can afford. Remember, it’s the thought that counts. Also, keep in mind that this number can vary depending on how close you are to the couple.  Here, we break down some fantastic wedding gift ideas for wine lovers across an array of price points.  10 Best Wine Wedding Gifts  Personalized Vivid Decanter Any oenophile knows the importance of using a wine decanter. It is crucial when it comes to letting the vino “breathe” to enhance its aroma, flavor and texture—while also separating it from any solids or sediments. For one that combines functionality and style with a sweet, sentimental touch, consider this Vivid Decanter, which can be personalized with the couple’s initials. The decanter is hand-made in Europe and constructed with lightweight, lead-free crystal for added durability.

But, when a photograph of the happy couple and the details of the marriage were published, the union of the mayor of Araucária and his fifth wife became headline news in the city in the southern state of Paraná and, in a heartbeat, all over Brazil. The wedding led to controversy as it took place four days after the bride turned 16, the minimum age in Brazil to legally marry with the permission of family or a judge, and because the groom is 65 years old. Eyebrows were also raised when it became known that the day before the ceremony the alderman had given his future mother-in-law a position in City Hall, appointing her councilor for culture. Despite the half-century age difference between the couple, it was this act of nepotism that raised the most outrage.  But despite the singular elements of this particular union, it is far from an uncommon event in Brazil. Last year, Brazilian notaries registered 12,509 marriages in which at least one of the participants was aged 16 or 17. That equates to 34 teenage spouses per day, the vast majority of whom were female.  A photograph of the beaming couple as Kauane Rode Camargo places a wedding ring on Hissam Hussein Dehaini swiftly went viral. The mayor’s political party moved quickly to disown him. And, in the face of a public backlash against the appointment of his mother-in-law, he soon dismissed her, although he initially pointed to her 26 years’ experience in public service as proof of her credentials.  Almost a month after the marriage, the newlyweds remain the most talked-about subject among Araucária’s population of around 140,000. “As anywhere, there are people who are for and against it,” says E. T., who asks to be identified by his initials in order to speak freely. “But I have noticed that, because he is an excellent administrator, his supporters choose not to look at the negative side, that it [the marriage] is legal, but immoral. Many have congratulated them, and wished them good luck.”  E. T. knows Dehaini personally, but his wife only by sight. He points out that the mayor is a successful businessman with interests in hotels, gas stations and airline charters that have created many jobs locally (although E. T. also mentions Dehaini was arrested on suspicion of links to drug trafficking two decades ago, according to the website G1, part of the Globo group). In his personal life, he has been married on four other occasions and has 16 children. His current wife was a recent finalist in the Miss Araucária Teen 2022 pageant. Although it is a conservative city, Araucária also hosts a beauty contest for young girls in the style of the movie Little Miss Sunshine.  Hissam Hussein Dehaini and his 16-year-old wife Kauane Rode Camargo. RR SS  Perhaps the age difference between Dehaini and Camargo did not come as much of a shock because Brazil is well-accustomed to marriages between older men and much younger women. The political elite serve as an example: President Lula da Silva is 21 years older than his wife, Janja and his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, is 27 years older than his wife Michelle. The record, though, goes to Michel Temer, president from August 2016 to December 2018, who is 43 years older than his wife, Marcela, whom he met in 2002 when he was already a veteran politician, and she was a 19-year-old newly crowned miss.  The marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, while causing controversy, has served to renew the focus on child weddings in Brazil, which remains a widespread practice. But legal marriages performed before the relevant authorities are only the tip of the iceberg, says Ana Nery Lima, a gender specialist with the NGO Plan International, who says that “informal unions in Brazil are very normalized.” The United Nations estimates that 26% of Brazilian women live with a partner before they are 18, including 6% who are not even 15. “In Brazil, when people hear the expression child marriage, they usually think of child brides of nine or 10 years old in India, but they don’t think of people they know, such as that neighbor, that aunt or their grandmother, who got married at 14,” says Lima. “In the eyes of the United Nations, child marriage is a formal or informal union in which at least one of the parties is younger than 18.” In global terms, Brazil ranks fifth in the world in terms of child marriages, with 2.2 million people falling under this category. In percentage terms, however, it is not in the top 20 worldwide, a list headed by Niger where 76% of minors cohabit with a partner before the age of 18.  In Brazil, the main reasons for this phenomenon are socioeconomic and cultural. “When two minors marry, it is usually because she is pregnant and the family wants to protect the girl’s reputation. But there are also very poor families who have many children and who think: ‘Look, at least [in another family] she will have something to eat, clothes to wear,’” says Lima. “Then there is that deep-rooted, macho culture that young women are more attractive.” The specialist notes that in weddings involving minors aged 16 and 17, the age difference between the spouses is usually around 15 years, “and this means a very large inequality of power.”  Although there were still over 12,500 legal child marriages last year in Brazil, the number of such unions has fallen by 30% since 2019 when Congress reformed the Civil Code to ban marriage before the age of 16 altogether, thus closing a loophole that ultimately allowed an adult who had raped a minor to marry her instead of going to jail, while also denying her access to abortion care, which she is entitled to by law. Any sexual relationship with someone aged under 16, consensual or not, is a crime in Brazil and no child aged under 16 can marry, regardless of whether his or her family has blessed it or not. Lima says this is a step in the right direction, but Plan International is still fighting to make marriage before the age of 18 illegal.  Following the controversy over the marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, the Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation into the Araucária mayor’s wedding and accusations of nepotism. However, as his wife is a minor, the details of the case cannot be made public.  Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition"

Selecting the wedding dress was a particularly fun part of the process for Kamila, who, throughout her career as a model, has worn many. “I went to Galia Lahav for the first time and picked three different dresses,” she admits. “A week later, I went back and chose a completely different one. I just fell in love with it, and they were able to make it for me in less than a month. Record time! I’m so glad it worked out because I loved the dress and felt it was perfect for my beach wedding.”  The bride kept her jewelry pieces simple and befitting of the al fresco wedding location. She wore a classic diamond necklace, bracelet, and earrings all from Material Good. As for beauty, she worked with Lauren Hen for a sun-kissed look, and also kept her hair down to ensure it felt as natural as possible. “Less is always more,” Kamila says.  The ceremony started just after 6:30 p.m., and the service took place under a jaw-droppingly beautiful chuppah consisting of garden and spray roses, hanging amaranthus, larkspur, snapdragons, frilled lisianthus, and astrantia, all by Petal Productions. First, Oren’s older brother and his 87-year-old grandmother walked down the aisle, followed by his middle brother and his fiancée. Next, his twin brother with his wife and the couple’s niece made their way down the aisle, Oren and his both parents—and lastly, the bride was escorted by her parents, who flew in from Brazil."

Aric Hutchinson and at least 100 mourners gathered on Saturday at Folly Beach — the same beach where he and Samantha Miller, 34, married just hours before the deadly crash — for a memorial in honor of his late wife, CBS affiliate WCSC of Charleston reported.  Hutchinson, who sat in a wheelchair on the shoreline at the memorial, told the local station he’s “feeling pretty good” as he recovers from his injuries. He suffered a brain injury and broken bones as a result of crash, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his mother to help cover the cost of medical fees and the burial for Miller.  “My body’s getting back to where I can manage, I guess,” Hutchinson told WCSC at the memorial. “It’s just as good as I can feel with the situation, but obviously, today and the outpouring of people was just amazing. I know Sam would love it.”  “I mean, she’s a beach girl, through and through,” he added. “We do walk here almost every morning, and this is her send-off for sure. She’s up there smiling for sure.”  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller. Family of Samantha Miller / AP  He and Miller had been leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart when the crash unfolded on April 28, The Associated Press reported.  A woman identified by police as Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, was accused of slamming into the back of the golf cart while allegedly driving while drunk and over twice the speed limit, according to an incident report.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm after the crash, according to online records, which show that she remains in police custody.  Two other people in the golf cart besides the groom were also injured, Andrew Gilreath, Folly Beach public safety department director told the AP. He added that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Komoroski was not physically injured in the crash, according to a news release from city officials.  A witness reported that Komoroski “was dazed and confused” at the scene and repeatedly said “I did nothing wrong” and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  That report also states that Komoroski told a sergeant on the scene that she had two drinks that night: a beer and a “tequila pineapple an hour ago or so.”  Samantha Miller's mother, Lisa Miller, told Fox News Digital that Komoroski ""chose to drink, get behind the wheel, and plow down my daughter.""  ""This is a conscious choice that a young lady made,"" Lisa Miller alleged.  Komoroski's attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in a statement released last week: “We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.”"

Dia & Co, which offers personal styling services and plus-size apparel, now has an online landing page called the Wedding Suite. The page, which went live last week, features 38 collections curated by Dia & Co stylists. These include “bride,” “wedding guest,” “mother of the bride and groom” and “beach wedding.” In total, the Wedding Suite contains 2,200 styles from 64 brands, including Carolina Herrera, Diane von Furstenberg, Ever-Pretty and Eloquii.  In addition to the newly-curated collections, Dia & Co launched a Wedding Styling Service for brides, bridesmaids, mothers of the bride and wedding guests. The service is free, and customers can go online to receive advice and feedback about styles and sizing. While it’s still early, the reaction to the styling service has been positive, the brand says. Dia & Co sells dresses directly via its website but also recommends certain vetted salons for those who want to design their gowns in person.  In general, the apparel market still has a long ways to go in terms of inclusion. It’s not uncommon for major retailers to start offering plus sizes, only to reduce or even eliminate offerings a couple of years later, citing cost issues or problems with demand. And while it’s true that several brands do sell plus-size wedding dresses — David’s Bridal and Anthropologie, for example — many of today’s dresses do not come in a variety of styles and silhouettes, which makes the process of finding the perfect dress even harder. In addition, as The Cut writes, bridal stores want to stock as many styles as possible, so they typically carry “as few samples as possible” for people to try on.  Nadia Boujarwah, who co-founded Dia & Co in 2015, told Modern Retail she wanted to launch the Wedding Suite after getting married 10 months ago. Finding a dress was extremely complicated, she said, as many of the boutiques she visited had few options in stock. One boutique in New York City told her she could only try on four dresses, while another asked her to just hold a dress up to her body and “see” if it would fit.  “The traditional bridal salon experience can really be very painful. For the most part, these are dresses that are made to fit very, very few women,” Boujarwah explained. “It was truly unbelievable to me how challenging it was… I got through my experience with a thick skin and a lot of help, but really came away from it feeling like there’s just so much better that we could be doing here. This is one of the last frontiers of inclusive fashion.”  The U.S. bridal wear market is a major industry, estimated to be worth $27 billion. Roughly 2.6 million couples got married in 2022, more than any year since 1984, the Wedding Report found.  Before launching the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co had a “pretty extensive” offering of wedding wear, Boujarwah said. However, it did not have true bride or bridesmaid collections, and everything was self-service. With the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co wanted “to really build out that offering of the true wedding bridal wardrobe for both our brides and an inclusive bridal party,” Boujarwah said.  For instance, while Dia & Co normally offers sizes 10 to 32, the bridesmaids’ dresses now go from sizes 0 to 40. All of Dia & Co’s Wedding Suite items come in a variety of styles, as well, with silhouettes as varied as A-line, flare, midi and floor length.  That plethora of options is crucial, Shafonne Myers, editor-in-chief of the plus-size bridal magazine Pretty Pear Bride, told Modern Retail. “So often you see style guides and selections based off of straight sizes, so to see inspiration that looks like us, it’s so refreshing and inspirational,” she said.  Gabriella Santaniello, founder of A Line Partners, explained that wedding dresses are typically sized smaller than everyday clothes, so a woman who is normally a size four in a regular dress would probably be a six or an eight in a wedding dress. However, very few salons have plus-sized samples on the rack, she explained, which throws the sizing difference off even more.  “A lot of these… brands say that they’re inclusive, but when you go to try on, there’s really nothing in your size,” Santaniello said. “So you end up squeezing yourself into a dress, if you can even do it… It’s just not a fun experience.”  Santaniello said she’s sure there’s “a cost involved” to produce plus-sized samples. “But also what would be the incremental business you’d get from it?” she asked. “Probably a lot, if a woman could come in and feel that she had a reasonable idea as to what she’d look like in the dress.”  Myers, a wedding and events planner, said there are more options now for plus-size brides than when she got married 19 years ago, But, she added, “not enough brands cater to the market.”  “In my opinion, it’s because we as a plus-size audience don’t demand it enough,” she said. “…I would love to see more of the plus-size demographic speaking up about what they want. The louder we can get as a community and demographic, the more of an impact we can have.”"

Just as the early bird catches the worm, the DIY wedding couple saves more money for honeymoon piña coladas. So to help you soon-to-be-newlyweds, today we’re talking about the decoration ideas that leave you inspired to take on a project or two that could save you cash. Have you secretly dreamed of being a florist? Here’s your chance to show off your petal-arranging chops. Still have the handwriting of a fourth grader? Eh, maybe book a calligrapher. So that you know what’s even possible, we’ve rounded up 39 DIY wedding decorations ideas from industry insiders across the country.  But before we dive in, here are some general tips about decorating a wedding like a pro…  Is it cheaper to do your own wedding decor?  When it comes to wedding decor, one of the biggest expenses is flowers. If you’re able (and willing) to tackle those, savings can be substantial—potentially thousands of dollars. Joan Wyndrum O’Hear, founder and owner of Blooms By The Box in Watchung, New Jersey, suggests ordering wholesale flowers and inviting family and friends (like your wedding party) to help make bouquets and boutonnieres. “Create small affordable bouquets with big blooms such as hydrangeas, peonies, or football mums paired with lush greenery,” she says. “You’ll need fewer stems when you use bigger flowers. Also, go with leafy greenery for the boutonnieres.”  How can I decorate my wedding on my own?  Beyond a glue gun (though you’ll definitely need one of those too), high-tech DIY tools make it easier than ever to decorate your wedding. Investing in a single device, such as a cutting machine like the Silhouette Cameo, for example, can make it possible to craft a slew of different DIY projects. Custom cake toppers, T-shirts for your bridesmaids, wedding signs, and programs can all be made with the same machine.  Additionally, taking a class to learn a new DIY skill might make your wedding projects, dare we say, fun. Sign up for a flower-arranging class, a candle-making workshop, a paper crafting lesson, or a calligraphy tutorial.  How can I make a cheap wedding look expensive?  Your venue will play a major role in your wedding style. And if you choose a place with built-in decor or eye-catching surroundings, you can achieve an expensive look without spending a fortune to dress up a blank-slate banquet hall. Jacqueline Vizcaino, owner of Atlanta-based Tinted Events Design and Planning, recommends opting for an outdoor wedding. “Explore natural venues instead of traditional halls,” she says. “Look for places like open-air gardens or outdoor parks where you won’t have to rely on electricity as much. This will reduce your carbon footprint and create a gorgeous backdrop for all your photos.”  What are the best decorations to use for a wedding?  “It’s always great when you choose decor that can do double duty or, even better, triple duty,” says Jamie Chang, owner and destination wedding planner at Mango Muse Events in San Francisco. “For example, a small plant or bud vase can be decor, a favor, and a place card,” she says.  For more wedding decoration ideas that pull double duty and much more, read on…"

And when his son emerged from his upstairs bedroom seconds later, one of the men chilling yelled “Kill him! Kill him!” before advancing towards the 18-year-old. Mohammed said he pushed the lad back into his bedroom and ran to a bathroom, where they took refuge while the robbers hacked at the doors with their machetes.

Wedding rings are a symbol of love and commitment, and they come in different shapes, sizes, metals, and styles. Here are some things to consider when shopping for your wedding ring.  1. What is your ring size?  Before you start looking for a wedding ring, you need to know your ring size. You can measure your finger at home using a piece of string or paper, or you can use a ring sizer tool that you can order online or get from a jeweler. You should measure your finger in two or three places depending on the size, and compare the measurements with a chart to find your ring size. You should also take into account the width and shape of the ring, as they can affect how it fits on your finger.  2. What shape do you prefer?  Wedding rings come in different shapes, such as court-shaped, D-shaped, flat, flat court, halo, and shaped. The shape of the ring affects how it look"

She sipped smoothies and distributed bloat pills, as commenters suggested she was promoting unhealthy eating.  Advertisement  On Thursday, health and nutrition influencer Sam Cutler shared a ""what I ate on my wedding day"" video on TikTok, which chronicled her fastidiously healthful wedding in Boca Raton earlier this month as a gluten and dairy-free bride.  The clip, which has been viewed 4.5 million times, has sparked fierce backlash on the app, with many commenters disgracing Cutler for what they believed was promoting unhealthy eating habits.  The video begins with Cutler, who creates content under the moniker The Fit Fatale, sipping two different smoothies and being fed a grain salad by her maid of honor in the makeup chair. At the party, she notes a bottle of Arrae bloat pills have been distributed to guests, and says her chocolate wedding cake is ""gluten, dairy, and sugar-free.""  Cutler, 31, told Insider she had no idea the video would cause such a stir, given how similar it is to the rest of her content. Commenters were not only offended — some seemed angry.  ""So you forced your ED on all your guests and bridesmaids,"" a commenter wrote. She's now being called ""an almond mom,"" a term popularized on TikTok to describe adults with restrictive eating habits, and her ceremony, ""an almond wedding.""  Advertisement  The comments were ""low, hurtful, and harmful,"" the influencer said  Roughly nine years ago, the Toronto resident quit her corporate job to become a creator. She began documenting her journey to ""rebuild"" her heath in the face of several issues that arose in her twenties, including chronic bloating and adult acne.  She also endured a serious fall from a pilates class.  ""I was bedridden for about three months and really dove into trying to heal my gut and my brain at the same time,"" she said.  Nevertheless, as the video blew up over the weekend, it resulted in a spew of what Cutler called ""bullying and harassment.""  Many top commenters argued that a wedding marks a prime opportunity for indulgence and that Cutler was depriving her guests. Some went as far to say that she would be a terrible mother.  Advertisement  ""LMFAO i cannot imagine having an eating disorder themed wedding,"" reads one of the video's top comments, with 20,000 upvotes.  Cutler responded to this jab in a separate video, saying it was ""extremely low, hurtful, and harmful"" to label or diagnose someone who could possibly have mental health or body image issues.  ""If somebody is actually suffering, I think that that makes them feel more isolated,"" she told Insider.  Cutler said she didn't force guests to adhere to her diet  If anything, Cutler's intention was to inspire people with food intolerances to incorporate healthy habits when celebrating special occasions, she said.  ""I've never actually had anyone comment or attack me for eating disorders or promoting that in any way, shape, or form until this video,"" she said. Cutler added she has never been diagnosed with any type of eating disorder.  Advertisement  The creator believes some of the furor boils down to the mistaken notion that she forced her guests to hew to her diet. But guests had choices and ate standard fare, and many said it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, she said.  ""There was regular bread, we had multiple entree options that everyone was allowed to choose from at their table,"" she said. ""We had a lavish, top-shelf open bar.""  The bloat pills were optional too — stemming from a sponsorship with supplement brand Arrae, a longtime partner. (""Weddings are a really expensive time,"" Cutler said. ""If there's something you love and you can limit cost in any way, I think all the power to it."")  At the end of the day, Cutler stands by the video and says she's confident in knowing what works best for her body.  ""I'm not going to eat gluten and feel sick because it will make someone else comfortable,"" she said. ""I think the real conversation here is around removing food-shaming from social platforms … Everyone should be making the choices that work for them."""

Chad Andrew “Drew” Kelly Jr. was known for his love of serving the town of Moncks Corner. But his life was cut short after he was killed in an “accident,” according to an online obituary.  Kelly died May 12, less than two months after he was married. He and his wife were “enjoying their new life together” before his death, a post on the Russell Funeral Chapel website said.  “Please keep the Kelly family and the Town of Moncks Corner Fire Department in your thoughts and prayers over the next several weeks. One cannot imagine the pain and loss both families are feeling,” the Moncks Corner Rural Fire Department wrote in a Facebook post.  Over the years, Kelly had served with that department and also worked as an engineer/EMT with the town of Mocks Corner, officials said.  “Drew’s passion in life was fighting fires and serving his community,” his obituary said. “He was 2021 Firefighter of the Year for the town of Moncks Corner.”  Kelly was also remembered for being a member of his church and for having a “beloved dog.” After Kelly’s death, several people flocked to social media to share their condolences.  “This loss is particularly painful for many,” the fire department said, noting that the news resonated across the Moncks Corner area.  Moncks Corner is in Berkeley County, roughly 30 miles northwest of Charleston.  Moncks Corner and the Rural Fire Department didn’t immediately share additional details with McClatchy News on May 15.

In an cover story interview with Glamour UK on Monday, the ""Let You Love Me"" singer opened up about the planning behind her top-secret wedding to the filmmaker, 47.  ""[The wedding was planned] in two to three days, when I was out of cycle, which is what I call it when I'm not in album cycle mode,"" the 32-year-old singer told the outlet. ""His kids were there, and I really wanted them to be a part of it. It was either then or we had to wait for ages.""  She continued, ""I didn't want to do it without my stepkids there. So, we just figured it out, and we did it. And it was perfect.""  Rita Ora and Taika Waititi.

Her parents were on Zoom.  ""It was a dream,"" she said.  Ora — who publicly confirmed the marriage in January — also elaborated on her decision to keep the wedding private.

I had a moment of reality recently, where I realized all the stress and anxiety I had in my twenties – I survived it,"" she said. ""Not being swayed or convinced or second guessing myself.

The Bachelor alum and Coming Out Colton star, 31, wed Jordan C. Brown, 38, in front of 200 guests in a romantic ceremony at the Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley on Saturday.  The three-day affair, planned by Ashley Smith Events, kicked off with a family dinner and welcome party on Friday night, before a full day of wedding festivities began Saturday morning.  ""The day of our ceremony, we have a disco-themed pool party,"" Underwood told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview ahead of the couple's big day. ""It's going to be a fun wedding,"" he adds, ""I'll say that!""  For their nuptials, the couple wore custom Tom Ford suits.

As guests made their way to the ceremony where a choir and orchestra performed, they were greeted by a beautiful photo display designed by the couple.  ""One thing that's really important to both of us is that we've created this, we're calling it 'our loving walk,'"" explains Underwood, who appeared on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor before revealing in a 2021 interview on Good Morning America that he is gay.  ""It's inspired from a coffee table book that I was gifted after I came out called Loving and it's images of men in love throughout history.

""Next to them will be love letters from queer people in the 18th and 19th century that were forbidden or they had to send in secret.""  Olivia Rae James  Adds Brown: ""It's really cool.
