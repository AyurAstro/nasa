Invalid email Something went wrong, please try again later.  Sign up for the Hot Topics newsletter for hot style and sex tips  Two women who made a name for themselves as Hugh Hefner‚Äôs favourite Playboy Bunnies have been feuding for years.  Since the Playboy Mansion closed its doors a number of years ago, we have learnt that life inside wasn‚Äôt as glamorous as we were made to think it was.  Former Playmates have shared tales of carpets encrusted with dog excrement, unhygienic-sounding group-pleasure sessions and shady methods of payment.  READ MORE: 'You don't need to be pretty to be a sex worker ‚Äì you have to be smart'  While Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson were regularly photographed together and seemed to get along, they‚Äôre no longer talking.  Holly began dating Hugh in 2001 after she attended one of the weekly pool parties at the mansion and Kendra started dating the magazine publisher after she worked his 78th birthday party in 2004.  When E! cameras were allowed inside the wrought iron gates to film the series for The Girls Next Door, the group ‚Äì which also included Bridget Marquardt ‚Äì became recognised as more than just Hugh's girlfriends.  (Image: WireImage)  Holly, Kendra and Bridget were the stars of the reality series, which premiered in August 2005 and ran for five seasons.  But while they seemed to get along during and after the filming of Girls Next Door, their relationship quickly fell apart.  Even though Holly and Bridget were Kendra‚Äôs bridesmaids when she walked down the aisle in 2009, during a 2012 interview with CNN, Kendra said she was ‚Äúnever even really friends‚Äù with the pair.  And this isn‚Äôt the only time she‚Äôs spoken out about her relationship with the former Playmates.  ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, it‚Äôs a very awkward situation ‚Äôcause it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre The Spice Girls,‚Äù Kendra said on Fox 5‚Äôs Good Day New York in 2015.  (Image: Getty Images for Leather & Laces) (Image: Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)  ‚ÄúWe dated an 80-year-old man at the same time. It‚Äôs very awkward. [Holly] probably wants to distance herself from that situation. God bless her, she should. It‚Äôs embarrassing because I saw some things that she probably doesn‚Äôt want me to talk about.‚Äù  In the same year, Holly alleged in her 2015 memoir Down the Rabbit Hole that despite appearances, she and Kendra‚Äôs relationship was rocky from the start.  ""Hungry from her own 'team,' Kendra desperately tried to make each new Playmate who arrived at the Mansion her friend ‚Äî and her friend alone,‚Äù she wrote.  ‚ÄúAt 19 years old, Kendra was stuck with a 9PM curfew, a 78-year-old boyfriend, and a stricter set of rules than she had ever had at home.  ‚ÄúAnd now, adding insult to injury, she was finally realising that she wasn‚Äôt as special as Hef made her believe. She was just another blonde girlfriend ‚Äì and life at the Mansion wasn‚Äôt all she imagined it to be.‚Äù  (Image: Getty Images North America)  The drama didn't end there ‚Äì as it seemed Holly felt betrayed after hearing Kendra thought they weren‚Äôt friends.  She addressed it in her memoir, revealing that she ended up texting Kendra to address how she really felt, calling her a ""coward"" and ""the fakest person [she'd] ever met"".  Holly concluded: ‚ÄúAfter that, I deleted her number from my phone. Kendra and I haven't spoken since, and I have to say, I don't miss her.""  In an interview with Us Weekly at the time, Kendra slammed the book, saying ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that someone can‚Äôt be appreciative of what something like that has given them.‚Äù  Over the years Holly and Kendra have continued to have a back-and-forth over how they feel about their time in the Mansion and what they think of each other.  (Image: FilmMagic)  The last time either of them addressed their fallout was in 2022 when Holly appeared on the Juicy Scoop podcast.  She said that originally, she ‚Äúloved Kendra"" and felt like the pair had a sibling rivalry while in the Mansion.  But when Kendra was filming her reality show Kendra on Top in 2015, things apparently shifted.  ‚ÄúThings got weird with me and Kendra and I felt like [the producer] was encouraging that, like, he wanted us fighting, he wanted the drama,"" she said.  ‚ÄúHe wanted me to come on her show and, like, brag about how much money I was making in Vegas, so she'd get a little poke in the a** to take more jobs to make her show more interesting.""  Yikes, sounds like there's no love lost there then...

While relations seemingly remain icy between Harry and some members of the royal family (here‚Äôs looking at the Prince and Princess of Wales), anyone who watched coverage of the Coronation could see that Harry was clearly getting on with many members of his family. Even so, according to multiple outlets, Harry and wife Meghan Markle haven‚Äôt heard from the royal family since news broke of their ‚Äúnear catastrophic car chase‚Äù involving paparazzi earlier this week in New York City.  People reports that ‚Äúthe royal family has not reached out to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex since the incident occurred on Tuesday night.‚Äù (Adding fuel to this fire, the couple‚Äôs fifth wedding anniversary was yesterday, so there apparently has been no acknowledgement of that, either.) The Telegraph reports that Harry and Meghan are ‚Äúfrustrated‚Äù by ‚Äúthe lack of personal contact‚Äù from his family, with the outlet reporting ‚ÄúThe lack of personal contact, as well as Buckingham Palace‚Äôs refusal to publicly acknowledge or comment on the incident, is understood to have frustrated the couple, who friends suggested may have hoped to garner more support, particularly on a personal level.‚Äù  (Image credit: Getty)  (Image credit: Getty)  The incident occurred after Meghan was honored at the Ms. Foundation‚Äôs Women of Vision Awards in Manhattan Tuesday night; she brought Harry and mother Doria Ragland along as special guests.

In addition to the new season‚Äôs excitement, fans were also surprised by an Instagram post that featured the couple in a white and black ensemble. Online users assumed that the two got married or engaged and stated that he had a wedding because his ex Chrishell Stause got married.  Fans react to Jason Oppenheim and Marie-Lou Nurk's recent online post (Image via marielounurk/Instagram)  However, Jason debunked the wedding rumors by responding to Marie-Lou‚Äôs Instagram post. He wrote:  ‚ÄúClearly these photos are confusing people. Sorry about that. We did not get married.‚Äù  He added that the photos were from an event the couple attended a few days ago.  Netizens pointed out that Selling Sunset newbie Marie-Lou Nurk changed the caption after wedding speculations  On Friday, Selling Sunset‚Äôs newest guest Marie-Lou Nurk shared an Instagram post, featuring her and Jason Oppenheim‚Äôs photos.  In the first picture, the two were seen running while holding hands. Marie-Lou donned a white feathered mini dress and Jason wore a black suit with a white shirt. The photos and her caption left netizens wondering whether the two got married.  Marie-Lou‚Äôs initial caption read:  ‚ÄúHere's to a lifetime of adventures.‚Äù  As the wedding speculations filled the comment section, she changed the caption to, ""You always make me smile.""  Just below the caption, Jason commented, stating that the photos were confusing people and that they were not married.

While the ladies initially thought the new girl in Jason‚Äôs life was just a fling, he admitted to ex-lover Chrishell Stause that he was serious about Marie-Lou.  Selling Sunset cast pulled Jason‚Äôs leg over the age gap between him and Marie-Lou  The news of Jason Oppenheim dating a younger model came out in the open months before the premiere of Selling Sunset season 6. In episode 3, he brought in Marie-Lou to the Oppenheim office to introduce her to his colleagues.  Interestingly, the cast included three ladies whom Jason had dated in the past. He and Nicole Young were in a relationship 13 or 14 years ago, while he dated Mary Fitzgerald before she met her husband Romain. The latest was him and Chrishell Stause, as they were in a relationship in season 5.  When Jason brought in Marie-Lou into the office, Selling Sunset cast members started pulling his legs. Chelsea Lazkani started the age gap conversation by asking the model her age. Marie-Lou said 24 and then corrected it to 25 as it was her birthday. Chelsea further pulled Jason's leg by asking his age. In response, he said he is 45.  Once the couple left, the ladies made fun of their age gap. Throughout the season, the fun banters about their age were featured. In episode 7, Jason confessed to Chrishell that he was serious about his new girlfriend.  The ex-couple went out for dinner, when Chrishell spoke about G-Flip ‚Äînow married, the two were dating at the time. Chrishell stated that she and G were ready to adopt a baby and Jason could babysit from time to time. In response, he quipped that he and Lou would do it together.  Chrishell Stause replied:  ‚ÄúLou? She‚Äôs not gonna be around by the time I adopt someone.‚Äù  Looking at Jason‚Äôs expression, Chrishell was surprised to learn that he was serious about Lou.

Evelyn is one half of the husband-and-wife photography team of Keith and Evelyn Woodard.  First Light Carrantuohill, from The Woodard Collection.  We‚Äôre looking out windows as we speak, in Co Kerry, at mountains that the pair have immortalised on walls globally, thanks to interior designers snapping up The Woodard Collection for homes and corporate spaces alike.  Because in the past month, Evelyn and Keith have channelled their two decades together as high-profile wedding snappers into a whole new energy flow as in-demand interiors artists.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been passionate about interiors ‚Äî at one point we had nine couches in the house,‚Äù says Evelyn.  ‚ÄúBut as photographers, both Keith and I have a good eye naturally, and know what works.‚Äù  Keith and Evelyn Woodard.  ENTRY SPACE  Back to the notion of ‚Äújust turning up‚Äù.  The scene for Evelyn and Keith‚Äôs life ‚Äî and ultimately work ‚Äî partnership, was set in 1996.  That was when the pair first spotted one another in Evelyn‚Äôs local post office, in Faha, just outside Killarney, Co Kerry.  Then, he was a 35-year-old father of three, newly separated from his wife.  Evelyn was 22 and both were immediately smitten, but initially thought the other was married.  ‚ÄúKeith had moved into the area and had been living here with his three kids when I met him,‚Äù says Evelyn. ‚ÄúHe was so tanned I thought he might be Italian ‚Äî until he opened his mouth to speak! I was so disappointed to discover he was only from the UK,‚Äù she jokes.  The Dingle Train from The Woodard Collection.  Prior to becoming a photographer, London-born Keith had played tournaments throughout Europe as a professional golfer, with the likes of Nick Faldo.  Keith had come to Ireland on a golfing holiday in 1984. He married an Irish woman and was manager of Ballybunion Golf Club.  It was his golfing career that led to Keith‚Äôs photography career, which developed into a successful wedding photography business. ‚ÄúKeith literally started out by taking photographs of golf courses,‚Äù says Evelyn.  MARRIAGE SPACES  Evelyn ‚Äî who formerly worked in business and corporate travel ‚Äî and Keith themselves exchanged vows in Baltimore, Co Cork, in 2003. They have a son, Marc, 21, and Keith‚Äôs sons and daughters ‚Äî Nick, Jason, and Siran ‚Äî from his previous marriage.  One day, Keith asked Evelyn to help him out at a wedding. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how I got into photography,‚Äù she says.  Evelyn Woodard.  The bride and groom chose many of Evelyn‚Äôs shots, and the rest is history. High-profile nuptials they covered together over the years included the wedding of Michael Flatley and Niamh O‚ÄôBrien.  Keith Woodard.  OUTDOOR SPACES  Evelyn is quick to point out that Keith has helped her hone her photography skills. ‚ÄúI had never considered myself artistic at all, but even when Keith would photograph golf courses, I would walk the golf courses with him,‚Äù she says.  The Woodard Collection demonstrates how the couple‚Äôs work together is ‚Äúevolving‚Äù, she adds. ‚ÄúThe collection shows how we approach work from different angles,‚Äù says Evelyn.  Travel is another passion they share. ‚ÄúWe love Italy, France, and Lanzarote ‚Äî they‚Äôre our favourite countries,‚Äù says Evelyn. ‚ÄúKeith‚Äôs daughter Siran has lived in Lanzarote for the past 10 years, and we were recently there for her wedding ‚Äî but we just consider all of the west coast of Ireland as the most beautiful place in the world.‚Äù  The Way She Moves from The Woodard Collection.  INDOOR SPACES  The Woodard Collection includes not only a gallery of their photography of landscapes and seascapes, but also offers a bespoke service including room mock-ups to clients worldwide. ‚ÄúI definitely like to visualise what something will look like when I‚Äôm designing a space and I think a lot of people ‚Äî particularly women ‚Äî are the same,‚Äù says Evelyn.  HEALING SPACES  Photography is also healing, both as a pursuit and as an element of our spaces, I suggest. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing like it,‚Äù agrees Evelyn. ‚ÄúEspecially with our abstract works. We want to evoke a feeling of taking someone back to a time or place. If you‚Äôre stuck in an office, it‚Äôs wonderful to have something that transports you.‚Äù  A particularly healing image for Evelyn is the sea.  A piece from collection in a modern dining room.  Evelyn was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2015. Following treatment, she recovered ‚Äúeight years ago now, and all is good‚Äù, she says. ‚ÄúThe sea is so healing and such a healing symbol, I find. When I was sick, I felt there was nothing in the world like it ‚Äî to be outside, near the water.‚Äù  The photographer is a fan of ‚Äúslow living‚Äù principles: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a worldwide movement but I feel since the pandemic we‚Äôre paying more attention to it in Ireland. We need to take stock. We can‚Äôt just say ‚Äòyes‚Äô to everything. Things just turn up. Things figure themselves out.

The couple, from Leamington Spa in Warwickshire, met on a dating app 7 years ago and had their first date at a street food event at Coventry Cathedral.  ""We bonded over a love of food and hatred of bananas,"" said the couple.  The couple got engaged at Rydal Water in October 2021.  Amy said: ""We have always loved the Lake District, and we decided to have our first family holiday with our daughter in the Lakes.  ""Although we had spoken about engagement rings previously, and I'd shown Rich which one I liked, I still wasn't expecting it.  ""I was looking at the ducks with our daughter, and I heard Rich clear his throat and say: 'I know you've been waiting for this for a long time'.  ""I remember being so happy I was crying, and there was a lot of laughter.""  The pair got married at Cote How with an intimate wedding without guests.  They said they had a 'perfect' day with 'clear skies' and 'bright sunshine.'  One of the highlights of the wedding was when their favourite song, Islands in the Stream by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, started playing in the background.  Amy said: ""It's always been one of our favourite songs and never fails to make us smile.""  She added: ""We had our elopement picnic outside at Cote How and it was so lovely to peacefully sit outside in such a beautiful part of the country and take it all in, just the two of us.

Hosted by ABC7's Judy Hsu and Ravi Baichwal, ""Our Chicago: Changing the Narrative,"" takes a look at several leaders in Chicago making history and changes in their community for the better.  We hosted our special from the beautiful Zhou Brothers Art Center located in the historic Bridgeport neighborhood.  The half hour program airs Saturday, May 20th at 6pm, with an encore presentation on Sunday May 28th at 2pm.  Grace Pai and the TEEACH Act  Grace Pai, the executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, made history in 2021 when she led a successful campaign to require Asian American history to be taught at all Illinois public schools, making Illinois the first state to do so.  ""We looked at the school code. We looked at what are the requirements on histories that have often been left out,"" Paid said.  With its historic passage, the Teaching Equitable Asian American History Act (TEAACH) ensures that every public elementary and high school student in Illinois learns about the contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to the economic, cultural, social and political development of the United States.  Chicago's First Filipina Alderwoman, Leni Manaa- Hoppenworth  Newly elected 48th Ward Alderwoman- Leni Manaa-Hoppenworth, will be the first Filipina and queer woman of color to sit on city council.  ""When we are creating policy on things that will impact the whole city of Chicago, it matters if somebody is at the table,"" Ald. Manaa-Hoppenworth said.  She is the daughter of Filipino immigrants who came to the states to become nurses. Manaa-Hoppenworth is a lifelong Chicagoan, living and working in the 48th Ward for more than 20 years alongside her husband and three adult children. As a progressive Democrat, she has been an active force in her community for years, including co-founding the organizations Indivisible Illinois and ILVOTE.  Joffrey's Japanese Company Dancers- Yumi Kanazawa and Yoshihisa Arai  Yumi Kanazawa, born in Tokyo, Japan, and Yoshihisa Arai, born in Hiroshima, Japan, are both company dancers at Chicago's prestigious Joffrey Ballet. Since joining The Joffrey Ballet in 2016, Kanazawa has performed in many ballets and contemporary works including Wheeldon's ""Swan Lake"" and ""The Nutcracker"".  ""Joffrey Ballet is such a dream company for so many people,"" Kanazawa said. ""And it's such a big achievement to be able to be here.""  Arai began his ballet training when he was 10 years old with the International Ballet Academy and has also had a leading role in ""The Nutcracker"" as well as appearing as the Prince in ""Cinderella."" In 2018, he choreographed ""Firebird Suite"" for The Joffrey Ballet Studio Company. The special showcases the beauty of their dancing and explore their shared culture.  Suzanne Yoon  Suzanne Yoon has 25 years of experience in finance and has been recognized by Mergers & Acquisitions, Wall Street Journal and Chicago United.  In 2017, the Chicagoan decided to create her own business, Kinzie Capital Partners, making her one of the only women in the country to lead a private equity firm.  ""I felt like if I didn't do it, and didn't try, I would regret it,"" Yoon said. ""And I'm sure that was a lot of what was going through my mom and dad's heads when they were leaving Korea to come to the States.""  Vietnam Refugee, Restaurateur and Autism Advocate - Thi Tram Nguyen  Thi Tram Nguyen was born in Vietnam during the war and, at the end of the conflict, fled the country for a better life at age 8. Her Naperville restaurant, Chez Franois Poutinerie, has a two-fold goal: to introduce poutine to area residents and provide employment opportunities to developmentally disabled adults.  ""A lot of people come for the poutine, but they're going to come back for the mission,"" Nyugen said.  In early February, she was given the Trailblazer Award by Turning Pointe Autism Foundation for her advocacy, and she just launched a 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Friends of Franois which is committed to providing free job and social skill training to individuals with disabilities.

Earlier this week, other Georgian officials welcomed a decision by Russian President Vladimir Putin to restore air transport links between the two countries, even as the US and the European Union urged the government in Tbilisi to observe sanctions imposed on the Kremlin over the invasion of Ukraine.  Russia‚Äôs first commercial flight in four years landed in Georgia on Friday, spurring anti-Russian protests and stoking concern thawing relations may jeopardize the Caucasian nation‚Äôs efforts to join the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    A Georgian Airways plane landed in Moscow earlier on Saturday, according to the Tbilisi airport spokeswoman Nino Tsivtsivadze.  Zourabichvili also responded to reports that the Kvareli Lake resort in eastern Georgia is hosting a wedding organized by family members of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  The wedding party will not take place in Georgia, the president said in her address, adding that the family had left the country following the marriage registration.

If you are a recent graduate, parent of a graduate, or grandparent of a graduate, congratulations!  It is a wonderful and important milestone that calls for celebration. When I worked in the Registrar‚Äôs Office, graduation was our ‚Äúparty.‚Äù We were quite involved in the ceremonies and details. One sure signal that it was time for graduation was the blooms on the Magnolia trees and all the U-Haul trucks and trailers around town.  Email newsletter signup  The set-up in the Grove is always impressive and I recall wiping the chair seats as leaf blowers were also employed in the effort to dry and clean the seats for the morning ceremony.  Parents, before you put away the checkbook thinking that you are done and have paid the last tuition payment, may I share some reasons why you won‚Äôt be able to put away that checkbook or credit card.  First, there could be the possibility of said graduate needing to put down a deposit on an  apartment or perhaps a down payment on a house near their new place of employment. No more fraternity or sorority houses. That‚Äôs where your checkbook can once again be useful.  And just when you think your offspring has settled into a nice residence, a new job, and is  adulting, along comes ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù The spouse who now makes your graduate a couple and they want a wedding. And that wedding could really eat away at your checkbook‚Äôs balance.  After the wedding, you find yourself acknowledging that you have indeed acquired another child that you love as your own. One you appreciate what he/she brings to the relationship and supports and cares for your offspring. Wonderful! Your family has expanded to include another family, one that you must now share your offspring with.  From there, if you are lucky, you may welcome a grandchild. And let me tell you, you are freer with that checkbook/credit card than you have ever been. What fun to spoil this little one who completes the family circle and has captured your heart forever.  If you are the graduate, after the celebration of graduation is over, you begin your journey into adulthood. You are now employed hopefully in a job that you find rewarding. You have a nice residence, with a nod to your parents‚Äô willingness to assist you.  You have now accepted that for your career to progress, you must put your shoulder into the effort. You are indeed now an adult. Along comes that person that completes you and you marry. Again, your parents rose to the occasion to make the wedding memorable. And before long, your family expands to include a son or daughter. You are happy and life is good.  So, I have explained to you the cycle of life after this ceremony called ‚Äúgraduation.‚Äù It is indeed an end to the educational process, the more carefree side of your offspring‚Äôs life.  And it is the beginning of the life cycle. It is only after this milestone, that you will look back and define your timeline.  I also remind you all, the parent and the offspring, to savor each and every moment. Celebrate every occasion big and small ‚Äî birthdays, holidays, family gatherings.  And remember that graduation was a defining moment. The celebration that set you all on this path.  Congratulations!

I have the freedom to do what I want and look how I want, so I decided to have some fun with my hair. I didn‚Äôt appreciate her criticism.

You can remind her that you work in a field that allows you freedom of expression, and you chose to exercise that freedom. She has the right to her opinion, and you have the right to do what you want.  Point out that you have never made disparaging comments about her hair, and you would appreciate her extending you the same courtesy.  DEAR HARRIETTE: I‚Äôm going to the wedding of the daughter of a woman I grew up with. I haven‚Äôt seen them for years because I moved away when I went to college.  I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm feeling like this is almost like a class reunion when people stand around and look each other up and down and judge them on how the years have treated them.  Am I being harsh? Yes. But I have gained at least 50 pounds since I saw them last. I know how to dress myself and all, but I know they will be shocked when they see me. Heck, I‚Äôm shocked when I look in the mirror!  How can I prepare myself for what they will do or say? I am feeling extremely uncomfortable about facing people. I‚Äôm thinking I should just send a gift and skip the wedding.  Uncomfortable in My Skin  DEAR UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY SKIN: Guess what? Just like at a class reunion, you will most assuredly not be the only one who has gained weight since the last time you got together.  By all means, go to the wedding. Dress your best and check your attitude.  You are attending the most joyous occasion for your friend‚Äôs daughter. Focus on that. All eyes will be on the bride. When someone‚Äôs gaze lands on you, smile and talk to them.  Don‚Äôt say anything about your body. Ask them about their lives. Tell them about yours. Enjoy yourself. You can compliment people on things you like about their presentation or their stories.  If someone skittishly talks about how they look now, admit that you were a little uncomfortable, too, but you are so glad you showed up.

Deborah, Deborah and Su Hyeok‚Äôs relationship took a step further as they went from hating each other to realizing that they had been each other‚Äôs support system since they met. Moreover, both of them received a wedding invitation from Su Hyeok‚Äôs ex-girlfriend, Yu Ri. Su Hyeok was out of sorts after he received the invitation, so Deborah couldn‚Äôt tell him that he didn‚Äôt need to feel so hurt because Yu Ri was two-timing him. A few days before her wedding, Yu Ri called Su Hyeok because she missed him. Deborah knew she had to stop him because she couldn‚Äôt see Su Hyeok being any more miserable than he already was.  Spoilers Ahead  Will Su Hyeok Keep His Promise To Deborah?  Deborah had to attend a friend‚Äôs engagement, and Su Hyeok had agreed to tag along with her to make things less uncomfortable for others as Ju Wan was going to attend as well, and also to make Ju Wan jealous. However, as they are on their way to the engagement ceremony, Su Hyeok tries to bail on her to meet Yu Ri. Deborah lets him go at first but later stops him because she is worried that he might get hurt more. She doesn‚Äôt tell him the real reason, but she urges him to keep his promise to go to the ceremony. They get into a fight over it, but Su Hyeok won‚Äôt back down. He decides to go and meet Yu Ri but also promises Deborah that he will attend the engagement ceremony as well. Deborah goes to the ceremony as she had already promised her friend, and she gets ridiculed over her breakup with Ju Wan, as she expected. Meanwhile, Su Hyeok meets Yu Ri, who is drunk. She called Su Hyeok after running away from her boyfriend while trying on wedding dresses. She is scared and anxious, but seeing her in this state, Su Hyeok becomes calm and collected, as he needs to handle her. Yu Ri and Su Hyeok needed closure in their relationship so that Yu Ri could stop hating Su Hyeok, and he could stop regretting losing her.  Su Hyeok and Yu Ri talk things out and say everything that was left out. Both of them are finally free from the burden of their breakup and wish each other well. Yu Ri notices that Su Hyeok has changed a lot, and he also realizes the same and wonders if it is because of Deborah. He goes to the engagement ceremony just in time for Ju Wan to arrive as well. Su Hyeok not only makes Ju Wan jealous, but the rest of the women are jealous of Deborah as well. However, they do not declare that they are dating, and Deborah just introduces him as a friend. Their chemistry is so good that even Yu Jeong feels that something is really going on between the two. Their plan works, and Ju Wan starts messaging Deborah. They end up meeting each other, and Deborah feels relieved after talking to him. It puts her heart at ease knowing that he was never the right guy for her, and neither was she the right woman for him. Meanwhile, her sisters, Bo Mi and Jin Ho, are having a good time as their young love blooms. Su Hyeok has been happier since he sorted things out with Yu Ri and is flirting more with Deborah. Both of them don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on between them, but they are too afraid to tackle that question.  Why Does Sang Jin Reject Woo Ri?  Deborah and Su Hyeok go on a movie date with the excuse of doing research. It was Su Hyeok‚Äôs idea, and lately, he has been coming up with many innovative ideas to spend time with Deborah. They accidentally run into Su Hyeok‚Äôs parents, but neither of them is awkward. Su Hyeok‚Äôs mother is happy to finally see her son with a woman. Su Hyeok never talks about his parents, but he tells Deborah that he has a stepfather. He is on good terms with his stepfather, but seeing his mother get divorced affected him deeply. He became reclusive at the time, and since then, he hasn‚Äôt been able to express his feelings freely because it made him anxious. However, he has decided to change himself now. Meanwhile, Sang Jin finally finds the courage to clear things up with Woo Ri over her one-sided crush on him. Woo Ri has been hinting at him for quite some time, and even though he likes her, he finds it wrong to date her. He is way older than her and is also divorced. He rejects her even before she confesses her feelings. On the other hand, Su Hyeok won‚Äôt stop flirting with Deborah and even asks her to pretend to be his girlfriend at Yu Ri‚Äôs wedding. When he went to meet Yu Ri, her fiance saw them together, so he lied about being high school friends and said that he would bring his girlfriend to the wedding.  Sang Jin and Su Jin are also at Yu Ri‚Äôs wedding, as they are mutual friends. They meet their old friends at the wedding, but they start mocking Sang Jin for his divorce and keep pestering him to give them the reason. Sang Jin doesn‚Äôt know how to respond to them, so Su Jin comes to his rescue. She mocks all the married couples in return and leaves the wedding hall with Sang Jin. Sang Jin had been trying to talk things out with Su Jin, but she never gave him a chance. He finally has a chance now, and he speaks up. Right before their divorce, Sang Jin‚Äôs business was on the verge of going bankrupt, and he was struggling to pay debts to many people. He wasn‚Äôt mentally well enough to spend romantic time with Su Jin. Su Jin feels upset and realizes that she is also at fault. Sang Jin couldn‚Äôt rely on her when he was going through a tough phase in his life, but she blamed him for all the wrong reasons. However, this conversation leads them to resolve all their hard feelings toward each other. Su Jin apologizes to him, and they are back to being friends.  Su Hyeok‚Äôs flirting game is going well, and he is giving Deborah every reason to get flustered. He compliments her when she says that she doesn‚Äôt feel confident about herself. He is also subtly hinting that he likes her, but Deborah is not getting it. She still wants to believe that Su Hyeok is just a good friend. However, at the end of Episode 12 of Bora! Deborah, Deborah finds out something that she thinks is too good to be true. While going through an old collection of pictures from another friend‚Äôs wedding, she sees Su Hyeok in one of the pictures. At her friend‚Äôs engagement ceremony recently, Su Hyeok mentioned how he fell in love at first sight with Deborah when he saw her at a wedding a few years ago. Now, Deborah can‚Äôt help but wonder if his story was true and not really made up.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZnVnaXRpdmVzLmNvbS9ib3JhLWRlYm9yYWgtc2Vhc29uLTEtZXBpc29kZXMtMTEtMTItcmVjYXAtZW5kaW5nLTIwMjMta2RyYW1hLXNlcmllcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-01-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T10:00:00","In January, I attended my first ever wedding. Later, I mentioned the event in passing at my publisher‚Äôs office. ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù someone said. ‚ÄúYou wrote a whole book about a wedding before you‚Äôd been to one?‚Äù  At that stage I had signed off on the final proofs of my second novel, The Happy Couple. Matrimony structures the plot; the first chapter opens with the couple getting engaged, and we follow them as the ceremony draws near. Why choose this setup when I‚Äôd never attended a wedding? Because I thought it would make a good book. To me, marriage is like extreme sports: I‚Äôm thrilled for those who partake, and have zero interest in joining them.  Marriage is a nifty narrative device. It brings together people who don‚Äôt normally meet, and occasions heaps of conflict. Also, it‚Äôs accessible. Everyone knows at least the basics of how their culture gets hitched. We acquire this familiarity as much from art as from life. That‚Äôs how I could write a novel about a wedding without ever having been to one. I researched some of the finer points, but I was largely able to rely on the knowledge I‚Äôve absorbed from decades of media immersion, from books and poems, from paintings and song lyrics and movies.  What will become of the marriage plot in art and literature as the actual marriage rate declines? It‚Äôs a question we‚Äôve been asking for decades; Jeffrey Eugenides‚Äôs 2011 novel The Marriage Plot offers a postmodern spin on the issue. Its heroine, reading English at Brown University, has to choose between two different men while studying virtuoso marriage plotters Jane Austen and George Eliot.  Marriage rates have since plunged even lower. That young people are tying fewer knots has triggered angst in certain quarters, though it‚Äôs hardly surprising. It‚Äôs hard enough these days for most young couples to rent a flat, never mind spend hundreds of pounds on a cake. But the real conservative bugbear isn‚Äôt that fewer people can afford to get married; it‚Äôs that fewer people actually want to. That fewer people are entering long-term romantic relationships, or seeking public validation when they do commit. That fewer people are judging themselves against traditional measures of success, or longing for a nuclear family.  When we look at post-wedding life in Austen‚Äôs novels, the success rate of marriage seems mixed at best  For the avoidance of doubt, I‚Äôm not suggesting that couples who marry can‚Äôt think for themselves. Actually, marriage nowadays is a much more active and informed choice than it was a few decades ago, precisely because it‚Äôs no longer the default. Those with personal, specific reasons are still getting married ‚Äì people like my newlywed friends. But the number of people who marry in order to conform is dropping off.  It follows that the traditional marriage plot will change in art as it has in life. The popular idea is that 19th-century female novelists romanticised marriage ‚Äì Eliot, the Bront√´ sisters, and, above all, Austen. A ‚ÄúJane Austen ending‚Äù is supposedly a happily-ever-after. But when we look at post-wedding life in Austen‚Äôs novels, the success rate of marriage seems mixed at best. Besides a handful of exceptions (the Westons in Emma, say, or the Crofts in Persuasion), most spouses are either bickering or dead. Yes, we‚Äôre generally told in the final chapter that the heroine‚Äôs post-nuptial happiness will last ‚Äì but Austen‚Äôs love of irony warns that we shouldn‚Äôt necessarily take the narrator‚Äôs conclusion at face value.  In 20th-century anglophone literature, the theme of marriage still dominates ‚Äì but rather than the events leading up to a wedding, we‚Äôre more likely to see what happens next. Marital (and extramarital) relations lie at the heart of James Joyce‚Äôs Ulysses, DH Lawrence‚Äôs Lady Chatterley‚Äôs Lover, Virginia Woolf‚Äôs Mrs Dalloway and the work of Toni Morrison, a committed Janeite who devoured Austen‚Äôs novels throughout her childhood. While not predominately concerned with marriage, Morrison‚Äôs novels nevertheless present a similarly nuanced portrayal of the institution. As with Austen, there‚Äôs the good (marriage as an exercise of agency between enslaved people in Beloved), the bad (Mavis‚Äôs abusive husband in Paradise), and the ugly (literally all the couples in Song of Solomon).  Then there are the groundbreaking portrayals of same-sex relationships, with all their realistic flaws, in the work of authors such as James Baldwin, Djuna Barnes and Jane Bowles. While such depictions still don‚Äôt dominate mainstream art, they‚Äôve certainly become more accessible in the 21st century. Brandon Taylor‚Äôs second novel, The Late Americans, centres on a gay friendship group where no single character must ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù their entire community; the tension in Douglas Stuart‚Äôs Young Mungo and Shehan Karunatilaka‚Äôs The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida comes as much from community strife as from forbidden love between two men.  From the UK publication of Kristen Arnett‚Äôs novel With Teeth to Todd Field‚Äôs film T√°r, starring Cate Blanchett, 2022 was a year of believable, therefore-sometimes-disastrous same-sex marriages. Meanwhile Akwaeke Emezi‚Äôs novels and Liv Little‚Äôs recent debut Rosewater take the beauty of queer love as their undisputed thematic core.  skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Bookmarks Free weekly newsletter Discover new books with our expert reviews, author interviews and top 10s.

Well, it depends on the author. One can still write a convincing novel with wedlock at the centre: Monica Ali did so excellently in Love Marriage. But this testifies more to Ali‚Äôs dramatic talents than to the contemporary importance of marriage. Show a character caring about something, and the audience will care, too ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs a birthday party, a frisbee contest, or a wedding. Novelists will probably always be able to persuade us that marriage is important to their characters. But they‚Äôll have to do the work. They can no longer rely on the reader bringing that assumption to the page.  I did not write my second novel about marriage with a rabid desire to tear the whole thing down. I am not aiming to inspire a wave of divorces, though of course I‚Äôll take it as a compliment if I do. But I did want to approach my fictional wedding with non-judgmental curiosity, tailoring the plot to the characters‚Äô peculiarities rather than forcing a ready-to-wear outcome. I considered what made sense for my protagonists, what they‚Äôd want, how they‚Äôd behave. Once I‚Äôd worked all that out, the rest was just typing.  That‚Äôs what I want for real people, too: an awareness of what‚Äôs right for them, and the resources to bring it about. Marriage can only benefit from continuing to become less of an obligation and more of a choice. Romance itself need not be a prerequisite for personal fulfilment; we were all, in my view, put on this planet to do whatever the hell we want. The more willing we become in real life to accept unconventional happy endings, the more emboldened novelists will feel to bring them to the page.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIzL21heS8yMC9yZWFkZXItaS1saXZlZC13aXRoLWhpbS13aHktYS1oYXBweS1lbmRpbmctZG9lc250LWhhdmUtdG8tbWVhbi1tYXJyaWFnZdIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9ib29rcy8yMDIzL21heS8yMC9yZWFkZXItaS1saXZlZC13aXRoLWhpbS13aHktYS1oYXBweS1lbmRpbmctZG9lc250LWhhdmUtdG8tbWVhbi1tYXJyaWFnZQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Get the latest news from Peaky Blinders straight to your inbox  Family feuds are among the most volatile situations which can all too frequently end in violence. Petty squabbles can quickly get out of hand and escalate to attacks on the streets.  Hurt pride and damaged egos can often overrule any sense of diplomacy or a desire to resolve things peacefully. This year we have covered a number of criminal cases involving long-running disputes including rows within the same family as well as rivalries between two separate packs.  Read through our roundup below which includes a trio showoff brothers compared to the Peaky Blinders, sisters-in-law who plunged a wedding into chaos and a 'public act of war' which resulted in the murder of a dad.

The 46-year-old performed a U-turn and then drove over the victim again in Garrison Lane, Small Heath.  Previously, Hassan had arranged for his friend to marry his former sister-in-law but regretted the move and launched a campaign of harassment as he tried to control her. In one incident he removed her from the property and attacked her.  A couple of days later he met with his friend to hash out their differences but they ended up arguing. Hassan grabbed his friend's beard, who in-turn pulled the handbrake on the car to get out. It was then that he was ran over.  Hassan of Rollaston Road, Dudley, was convicted of attempted murder as well as pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving and harassment. He was sentenced to 21 years.  Showoff Solihull brothers told 'you are not the Peaky Blinders' amid family feud  (Image: Birmingham Live)  Abbas brothers Ali, Zain and Bilal together with relative Mohammed Javed caused havoc on Coventry Road, Small Heath as they targeted a family member following a long-running feud. They turned up in a Volkswagen Golf, some armed with weapons, and started shouting: 'We're here to kill you' and 'we're going to f*** you up'.  Javed drove the Golf back and forth at speed before Zain Abbas got into the victim's Mercedes van and drove off. Two people suffered minor injuries as they were struck by vehicles in the incident.  The Abbas brothers, of The Crescent in Solihull, and Javed, of Coleshill Road, Marston Green, admitted affray and were sentenced to 12-month community orders. Zain Abbas and Javed also pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and were banned from the roads for a year.  Judge Richard Bond compared the family to the notorious Birmingham gang who were associated with Small Heath in the 1890s but he told them: 'You are not the Peaky Blinders '. Outside Birmingham Crown Court the defendants posed for pictures in front of a luxury black car before leaving.  Mum of nine put on tag after taking 'revenge' on sister-in-law at wedding  (Image: Birmingham Live)  Halima Ahmed threw a plate at her sister-in-law Zainab Ahmed at a wedding in Small Heath leaving her disabled. They got into a row at the Bia Lounge Wedding Hall having fallen out a few years earlier.  Zainab, 57, threw a biscuit at Halima, 55, who launched a flask of coffee which fortunately missed. Halima then tossed the plate which Zainab was able to deflect away but to the cost of her arm which suffered a deep cut resulting in ongoing problems.  Halima, a mum-of-nine, of Dirleton Road, Newham, in London, admitted unlawful wounding. She was spared prison, partly due to her poor physical health and the impact it would have on her youngest children. She was instead sentenced to 12 months suspended for 18 months, which included a 16-week electronically monitored curfew between 8pm and 6am.  How bitter family feud escalated to violent murder of dad on his birthday  Hassan Tasleem and Gurdeep Sandhu murdered taxi-boss Mohammed Haroon Zeb in a 'public act of war' amid a bitter feud between two rival families. They killed him in a drive-by shooting as the 39-year-old dad-of-four pulled up outside his home in Queens Cross, Dudley, shortly after 12.30am on January 31, 2021.  Tasleem pulled the trigger of a revolver five times from a Volkswagen Golf driven by Sandhu, who slowed down to put him in position. Mr Zeb, who was killed on his birthday, was not thought to be involved in the wider feud which had included previous acts of violence and another murder.  Tasleem, 25, of Richmond Road, Dudley, and Sandhu, 25, of Blowers Green Road, Dudley, were convicted of murder, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and perverting the course of justice. They were both sentenced for life and a minimum 30 years in jail.  Shamraz Ali, aged 21, of Tanfield Road, Dudley, was convicted of perverting the course of justice and sentenced to five years.

With the new trending flavours on the market, intending couples are spoilt for choice, but they need to be careful when choosing.    Fatia Hassan, the Marketing Manager of Cafe Javas says that many non-traditional flavours can be incorporated into a wedding cake.    ""For example caramel and coconut, chocolate fudge and vanilla, red velvet, and others. The couple decides to use their favourite flavours in harmony,"" she says.    There is also the option of having a different flavour for each cake tier.    ""Some rich flavours like chocolate fudge can be overwhelming so another way to present them is in the form of cupcakes or slices for guests. Alternatively, there can be smaller size tiers alongside the main cake,"" she reveals.    Other desserts like ice cream alongside the cake are great, but the couple needs to have practical ways to keep it frozen.    ""You cannot expect the ice cream to stay in its form for two hours, but instead there are macarons as an alternative form of dessert,"" she advised.    The intending couple should start looking for their wedding cake service provider as soon as the wedding date is set and must book a cake-tasting session with their provider.    ""They should strive to create rapport between themselves and the service providers so that they communicate their desires well,"" she says.    Hassan says that majority of the trending cake flavours are delicate and need to be consumed a few days after the wedding because the cake is usually freshly baked and has no preservatives so it might go stale if poorly kept for long.    She says for the few days it is still available refrigerate it for better preservation.    The Bride and Groom expo 2023 will be awash with the best wedding cake service providers, from whom a couple can choose.

"wedding","2016-11-24","Not Discerned","{""Bihar"", ""Bihar"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T02:10:20","I was never a fan of marriage rituals, especially those borrowed from Bollywood. Juta chhupana (hiding the groom‚Äôs shoes) was not a part of marriage ceremonies in my family till Hum Aapke Hain Kaun became a wedding template for Indians.  I was in principle against the concept of demanding money from my elder sister‚Äôs groom for a pair of shoes he had already paid for. So, when my cousins insisted on hiding my brother-in-law‚Äôs mojari, I decided to guard it instead. My cousins had the last laugh as they negotiated the shoes for Rs 5,000 and divided it among themselves. My failed attempt to protect the shoes became a family joke, but I never regretted my decision to not be a part of that ‚Äúextortion‚Äù bid. My non-participation was my will.  That year was 2005. The next wedding in my family took place over a decade later, in the month PM Narendra Modi made the demonetisation announcement. My brother‚Äôs wedding was fixed on November 24, 2016. That wedding, I spent almost entirely waiting in bank queues in my hometown in Bihar, hoping to withdraw Rs 10,000 per day from four different banks.  I watched my brother from a distance as women, mostly married aunts and cousins, applied haldi on his face and body. My mother, given her ‚Äòwidowed‚Äô status (my father had passed away in 2011), did not want to take part in the ritual and I, the unmarried elder sister in charge of organising the wedding, had several other things to manage ‚Äî decorators, gen sets, halwais, bandwallahs and wedding shopping.  Not many missed me. They needed a byahta (married woman) to perform the rituals and my sister was the obvious choice. My single status left them confused. Should I be allowed to take part in the ceremonies? I, too, didn‚Äôt volunteer, perhaps in the same fix as my mother when it came to marriage rituals. How could I convince her when I lacked clarity myself? Being single isn‚Äôt easy and explaining your status to others is worse. It‚Äôs this awkwardness, I guess, that pushes most single women away from crowded family functions.  On the day of the wedding, my sister decided to stay home to prepare for the bride‚Äôs welcome the next day. My mother had already declared that she won‚Äôt go with the baarat and I volunteered to stay with them. There were too many relatives ready to ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù us at the wedding.  In the afternoon, as the baarat preparations began, an uncle told me we could withdraw Rs 25,000 by showing the wedding card at the bank.  Advertisement  I ran to the nearest branch, but a crowd had already gathered there, a wedding card in each hand. I don‚Äôt know how many of those cards were fake, but the bank soon ran out of cash. I was worried about getting late for the baarat. I wanted to see if my brother‚Äôs sherwani had been altered correctly and if the mojari matched it. I wanted to be there when he wore the maur (headgear) and protect him from overenthusiastic aunts trying to ward off evil eyes with extra coats of kajal.  By 5 pm, a bank employee handed me a bundle of Rs 500 notes and I ran to my home, barely 500 metres away. At the door, my uncle told me the baarat departure had been advanced by an hour due to traffic issues. Standing on the stairs, sweating on a cold November evening in a cotton salwar-kurta, I felt like an outsider at my brother‚Äôs wedding. I hugged him and slipped the cash into his pocket. The baarat left with our relatives. My sister and mother stood at the door, teary-eyed.  Looking at myself, I felt cheated. ‚ÄúYou said you didn‚Äôt want to go,‚Äù she said, holding my hand. My eyes fell on our hands. Those were the only palms without henna colours. I guess this time my non-participation was everyone‚Äôs will.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvc2luZ2xlLWFuZC1zaW5nbGVkLW91dC04NjIwMzQ1L9IBVmh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvc2luZ2xlLWFuZC1zaW5nbGVkLW91dC04NjIwMzQ1L2xpdGUv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The son, surnamed Lai (Ë≥¥), fell to his death from a 10th-floor residence in Taichung owned by a man surnamed Sia (Â§è).  The mother told a news conference that Sia, an assistant at a land administration company owned by Lai‚Äôs father, on May 4 invited Lai out, promising that he would ‚Äúteach him how to handle his real estate.‚Äù  A woman speaks at a news conference in Taichung on Friday at which she accused a man of tricking her son into a same-sex marriage to gain legal rights to his inheritance. Photo: Tsai Shu-yuan, Taipei Times  However, Sia took Lai to the Household Registration Office in Beitun District (ÂåóÂ±Ø) to register themselves as a same-sex couple, the mother said.  Lai died less than two hours after the marriage certificate was issued, she said.  Sia‚Äôs actions suggested premeditation, as he had asked Lai to transfer the deeds for the land to the company, she said.  The Taichung District Prosecutors‚Äô Office said that it has listed Sia as a suspect in the case, adding that he posted bail of NT$300,000 after detention was deemed unnecessary.  The Civil Code stipulates that same-sex marriages give partners the same legal rights as other marriages, including inheritance rights.  A lawyer for the mother, surnamed Hsu (Ë®±), told the news conference that the marriage was ‚Äúabsurd,‚Äù as the two had only met twice, with the first time being last month.  Lai‚Äôs mother said that her son had recently started university and had been looking for a girlfriend.  The witnesses to the marriage had been two random people, she said.  The prosecutors‚Äô office said that an autopsy had been conducted on May 12 and it was awaiting the report.  A funeral parlor said that despite Lai falling 10 stories, his body was largely intact, with only one broken arm and little sign of blood, Chinese-language media reported.  Lai inherited 30 plots of land from his paternal grandfather, who was also his biological father, the reports said.  The grandfather had slept with Lai‚Äôs mother, an immigrant from China who was married to one of his sons, they said, adding that the father, who died last month, had adopted Lai.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL3RhaXdhbi9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDIzLzA1LzIxLzIwMDM4MDAxNjXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","0101-01-01","Not Discerned","{""Beverley"", ""UnitedStates"", ""female""}","2023-05-21T05:00:00","The owners of Grade II*-listed Yorkshire stately home Birdsall House have applied for planning permission to convert a service wing ‚Äòuntouched since the 1940s‚Äô into a nightclub for wedding guests.  The Honourable James and Lady Cara Willoughby submitted an application for their scheme to North Yorkshire Council in April, with Lady Cara describing the transformation of the kitchen, servants‚Äô quarters and stores as a ‚Äòmodern nightclub‚Äô.  A bar, sprung dancefloor and toilets would be installed in the basements of the North-East Wing, with an outdoor hospitality area also added. The space would be aimed at guests of weddings and private events, and would not be open to the public.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  The estate near Malton has been in the Willoughby family‚Äôs ownership since the 16th century, and the Elizabethan house was remodelled in 1749, with more wings added in 1776 and 1872.  Birdsall House is an Elizabethan hall near Malton  The North-East Wing‚Äôs domestic offices fell out of use after World War Two, during which the house was requisitioned by the army, and the number of staff employed in the kitchens then declined significantly. Other than the installation of heating and electrics, the rooms have remained almost untouched ever since.  A heritage statement submitted by the family‚Äôs consultants reads: ‚ÄúThis historical and architectural character of the house and grounds is largely that of the late 19th century, as devised by Anthony Salvin. His scheme of works included the extension and remodelling of the North-East Wing.  ""As seen today, the exterior of the North-East Wing dates to the late 19th century; the interior is of similar date though some fixtures and fittings are early 20th century. Most of the east face of the North-East Wing sits below ground level, with some self-set trees/shrubs and mature yews obscuring views of the block from the front.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  ""The proposed development includes sympathetic conservation, restoration and interpretation of the North-East Wing‚Äôs interior, keeping most of the historic fixtures and fittings, to create a unique hospitality space which complements the House‚Äôs fledgeling events business. In doing so, these private, unutilised, unheated spaces ‚Äì that have been and will continue to disintegrate - will be made accessible for the first time to visitors and support the economic sustainability of the estate.‚Äù  Lady Cara Willoughby  The project involves the creation of new entrances, the lowering of the ground level to reveal the original east facade, and installation of steps and access ramp.  According to the heritage report, there were 25 servants at Birdsall in 1861, but by 1921 this had dropped to 11. There was a butler, housekeeper, cook, ladies maid, governess, nurse, footmen, valet, page, gardeners, grooms, housemaids, kitchen and laundry maids.  The North-East Wing was rebuilt with extended service quarters for the eighth Lord Middleton in the 1870s, as he had 13 children and regularly entertained large house parties. The estate suffered during the world wars, when the 11th Lord Middleton had to pay crippling death duties, and after 1945, the area was used only for storage.  Advertisement Hide Ad  Advertisement Hide Ad  The service wing contains storerooms, larders, a dairy, game chiller, main kitchen, scullery, servants‚Äô halls, housekeeper‚Äôs office, laundry and wine cellar, with an ice house outside.  Under the Willoughby family's ownership, Birdsall has always been a 'party house' where guests gathered to hunt and shoot. Pictured in 1926 are Middleton Hunt Ball guests, including Lord Hotham of Hotham Hall near Beverley.  The report adds: ‚ÄúAt present some evening events must take place within a marquee which is not only expensive, but also takes people away from the main house and all that it has to offer. The proposed work intends to remove the need for a marquee, by providing an attractive and accessible area within the existing envelope of Birdsall House. The repurposing will bring back into use a part of the house that has not been used since the 1940s; during which time only the most basic of maintenance has taken place, leading to fabric deterioration.‚Äù  The bar will be in the former laundry and later meat larder and scullery. Original features such as the early 20th-century iron cooking range and Belfast sinks will be preserved. A dancefloor will be built over the kitchen‚Äôs stone flags. The vegetable store, which has a hatch window for deliveries of produce, will be reinstated and become operational again.  The application is currently under consideration.

"wedding","2021-05-21","Not Discerned","{""NewDelhi"", ""Delhi"", ""India""}","2023-05-21T06:40:24","New Delhi, May 21 (IANSlife) Indian weddings are renowned for their grandeur and cultural significance, deeply rooted in traditions that have been passed down through generations. However, as society evolves and modernises, so does the institution of marriage and the roles played by families in Indian weddings. In recent years, a discernible shift has taken place, redefining the dynamics and responsibilities of families during this momentous celebration.  The International Day of Families, observed on May 15 each year, serves as a meaningful occasion to not only acknowledge the importance of families but also to examine their role in shaping cultural practices, such as weddings, within specific contexts. In Indian society, where weddings hold immense significance and where the wedding market is a $50 bn+ industry, it is crucial to explore the evolving dynamics of families within this realm. Let‚Äôs take a deeper look to understand the changing dynamics and emerging trends:  Embracing Individual Choices:  Traditionally, Indian weddings were initiated, decided and planned by parents and elders, with limited inputs from the couple. However, in contemporary Indian society, there is a growing emphasis on individual choices and preferences. Couples are increasingly empowered to make decisions not only regarding choosing their partners but also around their wedding ceremonies, guest lists, their choice of wedding venues and vendors as well as every possible detail around their special day. Families are happily adapting to this paradigm shift by embracing the desires and aspirations of the couple, encouraging personal autonomy while providing guidance and support as we see an increasing focus on prioritising the couple‚Äôs happiness in the celebration.  Collaborative Planning:  Gone are the days when wedding planning was solely the responsibility of the bride‚Äôs family. Today, families on both sides actively participate in the planning process, creating a collaborative and inclusive environment. Parents and siblings of the bride and groom discuss ideas, share responsibilities, and work together to organise a memorable event. There is also an increasing trend of many events being shared between the families. This collective involvement fosters stronger bonds between families and promotes a sense of unity, as they collectively embark on the journey of celebrating love and commitment.  Changing financial realities have prompted a re-evaluation of spending areas  Indian weddings have long been known for their lavishness, with elaborate ceremonies, opulent decorations, and extravagant feasts. However, changing financial realities have prompted a re-evaluation of spending areas. So while on one side many families have been opting for intimate and budget-conscious celebrations we also do continue seeing higher-budget weddings the common thread in all is prioritising personal experiences. This shift has resulted in a more balanced and inclusive approach, where families come together to contribute their resources, equally distributing the financial burden, easing it for both sides, and ensuring a memorable wedding without compromising on quality. We have also observed that couples financing their own weddings is becoming quite common in India, especially amongst millennials. Our data survey revealed that almost 40 per cent of them have contributed in one way or the other in the new normal.  Redefining customs:  Owing to the cultural shifts, families are becoming more open to the ideas and preferences of all. This is also leading to a shift in societal norms and traditions. These days families are redefining customs as per the preferences and convenience of their loved ones. For instance, our September 2021 data survey reported a 76 per cent surge in the demand for non-saaya wedding dates. Even though this surge was primarily driven by the pandemic and cancellations, it has stayed snd it depicts the change in the mindset of the new generation. This shift is also evident in multiple other customs such as the division of gifting between groom and bride‚Äôs family, acceptance of a woman priest, and letting go of traditions like Kanyadaan and Bidaai.  Blending Traditions with Modernity:  While families adapt to changing dynamics, they also strive to preserve their cultural heritage. The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture involves finding a delicate balance between honouring traditions and embracing modernity. Families are re-imagining rituals, incorporating new elements, and experimenting with innovative ideas while staying rooted in the essence of their cultural practices. This harmonious blend of tradition and modernity reflects the evolving Indian society, where families celebrate their customs while embracing the winds of change.  The changing role of families in Indian wedding culture reflects the larger shifts happening in society. With a focus on individual choices, collaborative planning, financial prudence, gender equality, and cultural evolution, families are redefining the way weddings are organised and celebrated. These changes not only foster stronger bonds between families but also empower individuals to embrace their uniqueness. As Indian weddings continue to evolve, the changing roles of families serve as a testament to the adaptability, inclusiveness, and resilience of Indian society while continuously reminding us of the fact that no celebration is complete till you have your family to celebrate it with.

Not only did many consumers have piles of those iconic 20% off coupons just waiting to be spent, but many people realized that finding a replacement store for low-cost household goods would be easier said than done.  But as much as the closure of Bed Bath & Beyond has been a blow to everyday consumers, it's been problematic for engaged couples. That's because Bed Bath & Beyond was a popular place for couples to register for wedding gifts.  But if you're tying the knot, you're not out of luck. There are plenty of other options for creating a wedding registry. You'll just want to explore your choices carefully and make sure you understand the return policy for each.  1. Macy's  Macy's carries a range of kitchen gadgets, linens, towels, and other items that are perfect for couples who are buying a home for the first time or moving into a new one. Those who register at Macy's can benefit from a newlywed discount on the purchases they make off of their own registries and discounts on select product categories.  As far as returns goes, you can take items you received off of your registry back to Macy's up to 90 days past your wedding date or past the date those items were purchased -- whichever is sooner. From there, you can get store credit or exchange unwanted gifts for new purchases.  2. Target  Target is a great place to register for wedding gifts because the big-box giant has a massive selection of products to choose from. You can register for not just kitchenware and sheets, but furniture items, lamps, throw blankets, rugs, and other household accessories.  Plus, Target will give you a 15% off coupon you can apply to any leftover items on your registry that remain unpurchased once your wedding date passes. You can also return registry items for up to a year.  3. Amazon  There are plenty of good reasons to register for wedding gifts on Amazon. First, you can enjoy a 20% completion discount, which allows you to buy unpurchased items from your registry for less money. You can also return unwanted registry items within 180 days.  Amazon also offers a group gifting feature so that if you want to register for higher-priced items, your guests will be allowed to contribute money toward them. You can also have guests contribute to gift cards you can use on Amazon to buy just about anything -- perhaps some new swimwear for your upcoming honeymoon, or an e-reader to take on your trip.  Shopping at Bed Bath & Beyond often meant racking up a lower credit card tab than shopping at other stores. You might not only miss Bed Bath & Beyond, but be disappointed that you can't use it for your wedding registry. But thankfully, there are other options you can look at so your guests don't have to rack their brains trying to figure out what gifts to give you.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29sLmNvbS90aGUtYXNjZW50L3BlcnNvbmFsLWZpbmFuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ2V0dGluZy1tYXJyaWVkLWhlcmVzLXdoZXJlLXRvLXJlZ2lzdGVyLW5vdy10aGF0LWJlZC1iYXRoLWJleW9uZC1pcy1uby1tb3JlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We Have Some Insight For You  The happy day has come to start wedding dress shopping. While it's an exciting time, there's also a lot to keep in mind when choosing your dress for the big day. For many brides, there are several factors to consider that can feel overwhelming. There are so many bridal shops to choose from that it can be a process trying to narrow things down ‚Äî plus, you want to start browsing with enough time to allow for alterations. The price point is another factor. Wedding dresses can be hugely expensive but, thankfully, they don't have to be. Have a very clear budget in mind before you venture forth. And don't forget about the cost of alterations, as well as your veil and shoes.  If you're going dress shopping in person, keep in mind a few vital points. Firstly, note who you want to bring with you. A few close friends or family members who will support you and give you honest feedback are a lifesaver. Also, bring the underwear and shapewear that you hope to use on your wedding day, so you can get a clearer picture of exactly how the dress will look. Nude is best since it won't show through. Bring the heels you plan on wearing, so you can gauge hem length. It's also advantageous for dress consultants if you bring some images of your ideal dresses. Those visual guides can be hugely helpful in narrowing down a suitable selection.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvbWVuLmNvbS8xMjkwMDU4L3N0YXJ0LXdlZGRpbmctZHJlc3Mtc2hvcHBpbmctdGlwcy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

According to the participants of the protest, a wedding is taking place at the hotel ‚ÄúKvareli Lake‚Äù with the participation of Lavrov‚Äôs daughter Ekaterina Vinokurova and her husband. His brother is getting married, according to available data, and he is paying for the wedding.  Among the participants of the protest are members of the opposition groups: the political movement ‚ÄúDroa‚Äù and the party ‚ÄúNational Movement‚Äù.  Photo: Georgian edition of Radio Liberty    In addition to the fact that since morning there is a campaign in Kvareli, customers leave negative comments and ratings on the Facebook page of the hotel ‚ÄúKvareli Lake‚Äù.  Ekaterina Lavrova in Georgia?  This information has not yet been confirmed by any official agency. The administration of the complex refutes this information. They claim that there are no guests from Russia in the hotel, including members of the Lavrov family.  For the first time, information about the presence of the Lavrov family in Georgia was disseminated by the leader of the Droa movement, Elene Khoshtaria, and the TV company Mtavari Arkhi. Khoshtaria says that the couple signed in Tbilisi, and the party was planned in Kakheti.  Information about the signing is confirmed by photos shared on Facebook by Lavrov‚Äôs son Mika Vinokurov.  A journalist from the Mtavari TV channel called the Kvareli Lake Hotel to check the information. He introduced himself as an employee of a flower shop and said that the bouquet was ordered in the name of Ekaterina Lavrova. The hotel representative asked for time to check, then confirmed that a guest with that name was staying at the hotel.  However, after this information appeared in the press, the hotel denied the visit of Ekaterina Lavrova and published a special statement, which mentions that not a single guest in their hotel is registered under the name of Lavrov.  Ekaterina Lavrova officially uses her husband‚Äôs surname, Vinokurova, and even on Wikipedia she is mentioned under this surname.  The hotel and the territory adjacent to it are closed and no one is allowed to go there. But the hotel administration says that the reason is that the hotel is overcrowded and in such cases its territory is always closed.  According to the leader of the ‚ÄúDroa‚Äù Elene Khoshtaria, most of the guests came from Vladikavkaz through the Upper Lars checkpoint. ‚ÄúThey filmed videos on the road and shared them on social media,‚Äù says Khoshtaria.  As for Lavrov‚Äôs daughter and son-in-law, Khoshtaria does not know how they got to Georgia. However, she is sure that without the consent of the authorities and the security service of Georgia, this could not have happened.  Information also spread that the Russian guests were staying at another hotel in the Kakheti region, the Akhasheni Wine Resort, but this hotel also issued a refutation.  ‚ÄúWe will not allow liberal-fascist agitation‚Äù ‚Äì the reaction of the Georgian government  The chairman of the ruling Georgian Dream party, Irakli Kobakhidze, called the protest of part of society in connection with the arrival of members of the Lavrov family ‚Äúxenophobic‚Äù.  ‚ÄúWe predicted that as the tourist season approached, a new wave of xenophobic campaign would definitely begin, and now it has come true,‚Äù Kobakhidze said.  ‚ÄúXenophobia is not in the nature of Georgian society. This is an offshoot of the liberal-fascist agitation, and I urge everyone to refrain from doing so. There is no place for xenophobia in Georgia.‚Äù  He said that there are double standards on the part of the opposition:  ‚ÄúYou remember their attitude after 2008, when the wedding of Mikhalkov‚Äôs son took place in Georgia, then [with protest] the then President Mikheil Saakashvili personally arrived at the event. We all remember the excited positions of the fascist liberals at that time. Today, the same people are coming out with a xenophobic campaign.  These are double standards that testify to political goals. Their goal is escalation, and the main provocateurs here are Khoshtaria, Melia and others.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI wonder what kind of connections Elena Khoshtaria has, who will be the first to know about the arrival of Russian guests in Georgia,‚Äù Kobakhidze said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL2phbS1uZXdzLm5ldC9kYXVnaHRlci1vZi1sYXZyb3YtaW4tZ2VvcmdpYS1hdC10aGUtd2VkZGluZy13aGlsZS1zaGUtaXMtdW5kZXItc2FuY3Rpb25zLXByb3Rlc3QtYWN0aW9uLWluLWtha2hldGktYW5kLWFycmVzdHMv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Nothing comes easy for the fan-favorite couple, though, and the merriment surrounding the nuptials was diminished slightly by the murder of Carlos‚Äô father days earlier. Following the ceremony, T.K.‚Äôs uncle also passed away, ending his own life amidst a battle with Huntington‚Äôs disease . These are issues the newlyweds are going to continue to deal with when 9-1-1: Lone Star returns for Season 5, and Tarlos actors Ronen Rubinstein and Rafael Silva spoke about what‚Äôs next for their characters.  While we witnessed the terrible effect Carlos‚Äô grief had on him following the shooting of his father Gabriel (Benito Martinez), we did not see T.K. learn about his uncle‚Äôs passing, in which Robert (guest star Chad Lowe) enlisted the help of his brother Owen (Rob Lowe) to help him end his life. Ronen Rubinstein told EW he hopes we‚Äôll get to see that conversation between Owen and T.K.:  I really hope they start next season on the next day. I want to get into it. I want to see him find out from Owen, right? But when will that be? I'm not sure if he'll be completely comfortable talking about it right away, especially after his son just got married. Owen and TK have been sharing bad news for four seasons now, so maybe he wants to give him a little bit of a break. I'm very interested to see what that secret does to Owen. That's probably going to F him up pretty good.  How the Strand-Reyes family continues to handle those deaths ‚Äî and particularly Owen losing another brother ‚Äî was also one of the questions I had after the season finale . T.K. didn‚Äôt know Robert very well, but his reaction to Owen‚Äôs role in the death, if his dad even chooses to share that, is going to be very interesting.  Rafael Silva weighed in on his character‚Äôs state of mind as well, saying there‚Äôs no way Gabriel‚Äôs murder doesn‚Äôt change everything for Carlos going forward. He told the trade:  Carlos has changed ‚Äî but how? Is he still a police officer? Has he abandoned the force, or is he in it more than ever? Is he neglecting? Is he accepting? Is he angry? Is he depressed? Is he seeing a therapist? Has he gone crazy? Has he tried to take this matter into his own hands? I'm excited to see how Carlos deals with grief.  Also at play, Ronen Rubinstein said, is how T.K. and Carlos are there for each other as husbands, and he acknowledged that his character is going to be afraid of what might happen to Carlos.  Hopefully it won‚Äôt all be grief and trauma, though, because they‚Äôre officially married now, and if any couple is deserving of some newlywed bliss, it‚Äôs Tarlos. That‚Äôs a big thing that Rafael Silva said he‚Äôs also looking forward to in Season 5, saying:  But I'm also excited to see who Carlos is as a husband. I'm also excited to see if TK knocks on Carlos' door and is like, ‚ÄòHey, you ready to have a kid yet?

A new study in America has revealed more than 70 per cent of soon-to-be spouses have cheated on their partner while indulging in bachelor and bachelorette night festivities.  The New York Post has reported a survey of 6000 people - conducted by Bonus Finder - found that an overwhelming majority of almost husband‚Äôs and wife‚Äôs used the night as a last night of freedom and engaged in usually frowned upon activities like flirting, sexting or sleeping with someone else.  The survey found the main act of cheating came in the form of lap dances, which 33.1 per cent of people said they had received before their wedding, while 21.3 per cent of people said they had kissed someone that wasn‚Äôt their partner.  Bachelorette parties are also known as hens nights in New Zealand. Photo / 123RF  Meanwhile 11.2 per cent of people said they had slept with someone other than their partner.  Speaking to the US news outlet, Bela Gandhi, founder of Smart Dating Academy said the reason why people indulge in the activities at their pre-wedding party can come from a lot of different factors, ‚ÄúThese events are often fuelled by alcohol, controlled substances, peer pressure, and a lack of communication between partners.‚Äù  She added, ‚ÄúIt just goes to show what people think is OK culturally at these events, versus having these conversations with their partners.‚Äù  Bachelor and Bachelorette parties are also known as stag and hens nights in New Zealand and are a celebration of a person before they get married.  The party is seen as a ‚Äúlast night of freedom‚Äù however it‚Äôs more a space for the hen (bride) or stag (groom) to celebrate their upcoming nuptials with their friends and bond with them. The parties can last a night or a weekend and can happen anywhere from the week before the wedding to months before.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmV3LXN1cnZleS1zaG93cy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNzAtcGVyLWNlbnQtb2YtYW1lcmljYW5zLWNoZWF0LWF0LXRoZWlyLXByZS13ZWRkaW5nLXBhcnR5LzdZT0hCVk1WQU5DRkRDMkZYTFE1S09MN01RL9IBpAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvbmV3LXN1cnZleS1zaG93cy1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNzAtcGVyLWNlbnQtb2YtYW1lcmljYW5zLWNoZWF0LWF0LXRoZWlyLXByZS13ZWRkaW5nLXBhcnR5LzdZT0hCVk1WQU5DRkRDMkZYTFE1S09MN01RLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But what if I tell you that now you can say ""I do"" or tie the knots in space?  By 2024, a space travel company called Space Perspective plans to revolutionize the wedding market by delivering space weddings. Couples will travel for six hours to the edge of space where they would exchange vows in front of the Earth's curvature, according to the company's plans.  Eight passengers and one pilot will be able to travel on the six-hour Spaceship Neptune trip in cozy, reclining chairs. But it can also be altered to accommodate unique demands.  The Neptune spacecraft from Space Perspective is distinguished by its dedication to giving couples a secure and tranquil experience. Space travel is as safe as boarding a regular airplane with a 19 kmph gradual rise.  The spacecraft Neptune is launched into orbit by the company's SpaceBalloon. It then uses renewable hydrogen to propel itself without the need for rockets or leaving a carbon footprint. With no rockets or related carbon footprint, the spacecraft is driven by renewable hydrogen, providing an environmentally friendly trip to the stars.  Additionally, it has enormous porthole windows, which will make a unique setting for wedding photos. The windows of Neptune are ""the biggest windows flown into space"" & have a unique anti-UV coating in addition to being made of highly durable material.  What is Space tourism and Possibilities India might have it  For individuals seeking to create a genuinely one-of-a-kind and unforgettable event for their wedding day, this new endeavor is an exciting development. Many people have always found the thought of traveling to space fascinating, and now it is practical for couples to do so on their wedding day.  The six-hour Neptune journey can carry passengers 100,000 feet above the Earth before lowering them back to it. It will start official operations in 2024 and as per reports they have sold around 1,000 tickets already.  Photo Credit: Twitter  But do you know the cost and waiting list for it?  It is $1,25,000 (INR 1 crore) and the waiting list to get married among the stars, according to Jane Poynter, co-founder of Space Perspective, is already light-years long.  Two former Biosphere 2 crew members created Space Perspective to investigate the feasibility of closed ecological systems to sustain human life during space voyages. Biosphere 2 is an Earth system scientific research facility located in Arizona.  Anyone who is medically qualified to fly on a commercial airline can experience space travel thanks to the Neptune spacecraft's modest liftoff speed of 12 mph.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYXRpdmVwbGFuZXQuY29tL3RyYXZlbC1ndWlkZS9zcGFjZS13ZWRkaW5nLWlzLW5vdy1wb3NzaWJsZS13aXRoLXNwYWNlLXBlcnNwZWN0aXZlLWtub3ctdGhlLWNvc3QtY29tcGFueS1ldGMtMDA4MDk3Lmh0bWzSAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmF0aXZlcGxhbmV0LmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL3RyYXZlbC1ndWlkZS9zcGFjZS13ZWRkaW5nLWlzLW5vdy1wb3NzaWJsZS13aXRoLXNwYWNlLXBlcnNwZWN0aXZlLWtub3ctdGhlLWNvc3QtY29tcGFueS1ldGMtMDA4MDk3Lmh0bWw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The caramel-toned beauty and her filmmaker hubby secretly tied the knot in a low-key ceremony sometime in 2022. Following the revelation of their nuptials, the songstress slowly satisfied the public‚Äôs curiosity with little details about her love story.  After months of mystery, the ‚ÄúHow We Do‚Äù hitmaker recently dived into the dynamic duo‚Äôs romance, sharing new information about the lovebirds‚Äô journey down the aisle. Keep reading to learn more about the elusive couple.  Rita Ora Reveals Her Wedding To Taika Waititi Did Not Follow The Conventional Route  In a recent heart-to-heart discussion with ‚ÄúGlamour UK‚Äú for the magazine‚Äôs cover story, the ‚ÄúSoul Survivor‚Äù singer got candid about her relationship with the Hollywood icon. The chart-topper, who refused to reveal the couple‚Äôs wedding date, confessed the pair did not have a formal proposal.  ‚ÄúWell, honestly, there was no real getting down on one knee. It was more like, ‚ÄòI want to marry you. Let‚Äôs just do it,'‚Äù the entertainer explained, noting that she favored the lovebirds‚Äô decision to skip the engagement phase.  Despite being known for serenading thousands at her concerts, the Bambi Award winner admitted she disliked having an extravagant wedding ceremony. Sharing her thoughts on the matter, the 32-year-old stated:  ‚ÄúSome women like to feel that real special attention that day. And everyone‚Äôs different. And for me ‚Äì I think with my job, it is all‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs very attention driven ‚Äì I wanted to keep it private because my life and my career aren‚Äôt.‚Äù  Because the English songwriter wanted a low-key ceremony, her preparations for the wedding were tied to two crucial factors ‚Äî her career and Waititi‚Äôs two daughters from a previous marriage.  Opening up about their importance to the ceremony, the entertainer said: ‚ÄúThe wedding was planned in two to three days, when I was out of cycle, which is what I call it when I‚Äôm not in album cycle mode. And his kids were there, and I really wanted them to be a part of it.‚Äù  The MOBO Award recipient continued, ‚ÄúIt was either then or we had to wait for ages. I didn‚Äôt want to do it without my stepkids there. So, we just figured it out, and we did it. And it was perfect.‚Äù  Still raving about her ‚Äúdream‚Äù wedding, the ‚ÄúBody on Me‚Äù artist explained that her sister made it to the ceremony while her parents gave their blessings via Zoom. Meanwhile, the groom‚Äôs guest list only included his two daughters, which Ora claimed was ‚Äúamazing‚Äù for the filmmaker.  All About The Teen Choice Award Nominee‚Äôs Wedding Dress & Second Ceremony Plans  For her big day, the 32-year-old rocked a stunning wedding dress from one of her favorite designers, Tom Ford. The songstress revealed that she always dreamt of involving the famous stylist in her ceremony after falling in love with one of his earlier outfits.  According to Ora, she had never forgotten the white lace dress and full-length veil ensemble she saw at Ford‚Äôs 2018 fashion show. As fate would have it, the same attire was present when she shopped for her wedding dress.  ‚ÄúI went to Tom Ford‚Äôs shop to see if they had any wedding dresses. And they had this one wedding dress. So bizarre. I‚Äôm not even joking; it was on my mood board. Not that I‚Äôm crazy,‚Äù the entertainer exclaimed. ‚ÄúBut it was the one dress I wanted, and it was there, ready. And it fitted. It was meant to be.‚Äù  Aside from the luxury brand founder, the ‚ÄúYou Only Love Me‚Äù singer confessed that none of her friends knew about her wedding to Waititi. The 32-year-old told her pals after the ceremony. However, no one seemed shocked about her decision.  ‚ÄúNo one knew. No one was surprised. They were like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so happy for you. And when can we just throw a big rager?'‚Äù the caramel-toned beauty explained. Regarding the possibility of a second wedding ceremony, the Glamour Award honoree had no specific plans.  ‚ÄúMaybe sometime this year. We haven‚Äôt even thought about it,‚Äù the chart-topper confessed. ‚ÄúBut by the time we throw it, it‚Äôll be old news. My friends won‚Äôt care anymore.‚Äù  This isn‚Äôt the first time the ‚ÄúFifty Shades of Grey‚Äù star has shared important details about her nuptials and love story. Earlier in February, the sensational songstress flaunted the wedding ring she was given by Waititi on ‚ÄúThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.‚Äù  Raving about the large emerald stone jewelry, Ora confessed: ‚ÄúI just wanted it to feel really right, and so I may have taken him to the shop, and I may have pointed out exactly what ring I wanted.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlYmxhc3QuY29tLzQ4ODI4Ny9yaXRhLW9yYS1naXZlcy1pbnNpZ2h0LWludG8tdG9wLXNlY3JldC13ZWRkaW5nLXRvLXRhaWthLXdhaXRpdGktd2hpY2gtc2hlLXBsYW5uZWQtaW4tanVzdC1kYXlzL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-07-14","Not Discerned","{""Venice"", ""Veneto"", ""Italy""}","2023-05-20T08:04:49","Hello from my very own sofa, which of course those of you who watched Scotland Sings will be well acquainted with!  So much has happened in the past week since we spoke that I‚Äôm having a hard time believing it‚Äôs only been seven days.  I very excitedly boarded my flight to Venice from Dallas for the big society wedding we had been invited to.  I can‚Äôt remember the last time I was in Venice but I‚Äôm thinking it might have been around 45 years ago on a school trip with Ellon Academy. Anyone who was on that Italian school trip please correct me if I‚Äôve got my wires crossed.  I remember St Mark‚Äôs Square and the Doge‚Äôs Palace from the 70s but not a lot more.  I don‚Äôt suppose on a school trip we could have afforded a trip on a gondola and this time around we didn‚Äôt feel the need, we just watched other people on theirs. That‚Äôs not to say we didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time on the canals.  When we landed in Venice we went to find a taxi and realised that wasn‚Äôt so easy.  Water taxis were the way to go and being a true Scot I had no intention of paying for a private one if I could pay substantially less for the public one.  Here is a warning, if you ever go to Venice just suck it up and pay the price or you will spend hours on a boat and end up having to drag your cases from where you are dropped off.  On the way back to the airport suffice to say we booked a private water taxi which was expensive but was so enjoyable and just seemed such a fitting way to finish a wonderful trip.  We stood up with the wind in our hair and I sang every Italian song I know as we bumped across the water. I think the boat driver was pretty amused and deafened by the time we got there!  Anyway back to day one! Once we finally arrived at our hotel we didn‚Äôt have too much time to chill as the first event of the wedding which was a pre-wedding dinner was that evening.  We were whisked away by water taxi to an incredible venue, to eat fabulous food and drink cocktails.  The great thing about a pre-wedding party is that you get to meet everyone the day before so we spent a lot of time chatting to members of the bride and groom‚Äôs families.  I had packed a case for myself and for Gordon before I headed to America to make sure that we had all the outfits for each party with us.  Otherwise the smart velvet jacket that Gordon wore that night would have been forgotten and I couldn‚Äôt have trusted him not to turn up in an Arsenal hoodie!  This party went well into the night but like Cinderella on the stroke of midnight we slipped away to the boat as tomorrow was the big day.  As the time for the ceremony approached we were yet again taken in boats down the Grand Canal. The scene was just perfect, like something from a Hollywood movie. And this time I‚Äôd packed a dinner suit for Gordon so he looked fabulous.  Chloe Stroll, the bride, is one of my singers. Her manager rang me from New York during Covid and asked if I would take her on.  We did some online lessons in the early days and then eventually started to work regularly in person. It soon became obvious to me that she is special.  Walking down the aisle  Hopefully we will be bringing out her music very soon so I will proudly get to share her with the world.  We have become very close over the past couple of years and when she walked down the aisle with her dad looking exactly like a fairytale princess, I couldn‚Äôt hold back the tears.  The groom, Olympic snowboarder Scotty James, was looking every bit her Prince Charming as he waited at the end of the longest aisle I‚Äôve ever seen.  It‚Äôs not surprising that the image of Chloe and Scotty walking back down the aisle made the front cover of Italian Vogue.  Day Three dawned and we all congregated for a more relaxed get together although I‚Äôm amazed we were all still standing.  What a wonderful weekend was had by all. I was so grateful to be a part of such an event but now I need to sleep for a week.  I did however have the energy for a quick trip to say Happy Birthday to Auntie Agnes!  Have a good week,  Yvie x","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzYW5kam91cm5hbC5jby51ay9mcC9saWZlc3R5bGUvNTc0MTA4Ni95dmllLWJ1cm5ldHQtcm9tYW5jZS1pcy1pbi10aGUtYWlyLWZvci1hLXNvY2lldHktd2VkZGluZy1pbi12ZW5pY2Uv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-15","14:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T07:53:30","By Francis Ewherido  Last Monday was my 24th wedding anniversary. When I went into marriage 24 years ago, it was a mystery. Twenty-four years later, I am not close to unravelling the mystery called marriage. I have gained a lot experience as a participant, a counsellor and an observer, but I remain a student. That is why I am quick to correct anyone who calls me a marriage expert. I acknowledge that I have accumulated a body of knowledge on marriage, but I remain a learner.  Marriage is not an institution where you pound your chest that you have mastered the art. It is an endless sea of water. I see marriage the way I see surfing. Your knowledge of the art and commitment are crucial, but there are other factors outside your control for its success. When Joseph found out that Mary was pregnant with the child Jesus, the marriage was effectively over, but for God‚Äôs intervention. I sincerely believe in the God factor in the sustenance of marriage. But there are atheist whose marriages lasted for decades till one spouse died, how did such marriages endure? I do not know. But I know that the God factor has helped to keep my marriage alive.  Also, no single spouse can pound his/her chest for the success of his/her marriage because only one spouse cannot make a marriage work, no matter how good he/she is. I met a woman who went into marriage with a firm resolve to make it work. She did everything possible to make her marriage work, but it failed. If your spouse wants out, the marriage is as good as over. That is why everyone whose marriage is still on should stay humble.  You are only one of the contributory factors; you are not all in all. You cannot look down on others whose marriages failed. Even if you are an atheist, you must acknowledge the contribution of your spouse. Without his/her continuous consent, there will be no marriage. When a 99 year old Italian man filed for divorce of his 96-year-old wife of 77 years, the marriage ended. The wife had an affair over 60 years before, but the man only stumbled on the evidence at that time. When he confronted her, she owned up to the affair. Swiftly, the man filed for divorce.  In 1998 the 38 years marriage of Frederik Willem de Klerk (last President of apartheid-era South Africa) to his wife, Marike de Klerk, collapsed due to his infidelity. But former US President, Bill Clinton, committed the same adultery, and his wife, Hilary Clinton, forgave him and the marriage lives on till date. I am just trying to drive home the point that some factors that are responsible for your continued married status are beyond you. Clinton was lucky to escape. Notwithstanding, infidelity remains a major reason for marital breakups.  Money is another major reason why marriages breakup. These days, many girls say on social media that they cannot be in a relationship with a broke man. Money is crucial in marriage, but it is not all in all. The marriage of Bill Gates and Melinda Gates broke up after 27 years together. The same thing happened to Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos after 25 years of marriage. Both men were at different times the richest men in the world. Yet money did not save their marriages. Marriage is a wonderful institution created by God. I cherish it and at the same time look at it with suspicion and trepidation. It can be so slippery. You have to be permanently on the alert. Inertia can lead to doom.  Time has flown by in the last 24 years. It makes me to ask if we have actually lived together for 24 years. Facts do not lie. My first generation of children are in their 20s. They were born after marriage, so we are 24 years old in marriage.  I see marriage as two sides of a coin. The people going into it are good, bad and ugly. They bring all these traits into marriage. A marriage where one or both spouses are totally good is utopian. Such marriages do not exist. Even if they did, I am not sure I will be interested. Conflicts and the unexpected are parts of life and by extension marriage. What is important are mechanisms to resolve conflicts and weather the storm. For me, during conflicts, do not overstep boundaries: I have seen spouses call their other half fool, idiot, agbaya, mumu, short devil and other acidic words. Somehow, they resolve their differences and life goes on. But I am not sure my marriage would endure such acidic words. My wife and I are two strongly opinionated people, so disagreements are inevitable, but knowing each other‚Äôs sensitivity, we are careful, but hurtful words, not abuses, do ‚Äúleak out‚Äù sometimes. I know I have said to myself (I dare not say it out because it would make reconciliation more difficult):‚Äùwetinsef? Anywhere cloth like, make e tear (let whatever wants to happen, happen). But even as I say it inwardly, I add, ‚ÄúGod, na joke I dey o! Forgive me o!‚Äù  I do not belong to the school that makes rules that the sun must not set or dawn meets an unresolved disagreement. I am not mechanical. I dey vex my vex complete, then I carry eraser clean am.Married people should not take critical decisions in the heat of anger. Decisions taken in the heat of anger have ended some marriages. Even when there was window to remedy the situation, pride stood in the way. Sometimes pride for spouse when don see you finish nor make sense to me.  While growing up, one of the sayings my mother used to mold us was: ‚Äúyou see, in this life if you look in only one direction, your neck will become stiff, so look in all directions.‚Äù This has been very useful to me in marriage and in life generally. If you remember only the good things done for you, you are‚Äùeserinone(Someone who remembers only today‚Äôs good deeds).My wife does get on my nerves and drives me up the wall sometimes (and vice versa). But I never forget that she has stuck to me through thick and thin, in sickness and in health. I read the story of a marriage which broke up recently. The woman‚Äôs only reason was that she was tired of the marriage. I went through the same health challenges as her husband and my wife was a rock all through. When I remember her steadfastness, her faith even when I lost faith and thought I would not pull through, letting go becomes easy. I am not perfect, so I expect no perfection from my wife.  But I still believe forgiveness by spouses should not be taken for granted. Do not cross the red line. That is taking your luck too far. After 24 years, we know the no go areas. They should not be crossed. But every wrongdoing cannot be sacrilege. That is why your core values should be well spelt out at the beginning and in the course of the marriage.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZhbmd1YXJkbmdyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3dlZGRpbmctYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktcmVmbGVjdGlvbnMtMy_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy52YW5ndWFyZG5nci5jb20vMjAyMy8wNS93ZWRkaW5nLWFubml2ZXJzYXJ5LXJlZmxlY3Rpb25zLTMvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

It is a lie that causes many brides-to-be weeks, sometimes months, of unnecessary stress as they try to unearth ‚Äòthe one‚Äô.  Because there is no one perfect outfit ‚Äì and it‚Äôs time we all admitted it.  As I‚Äôm planning a woodland wedding for next June with my partner of ten years, part of the difficulty with finding the one is that our sense of style is forged by opposing forces and, at 30, I‚Äôve got the matriarchs of my family to thank for that.  My nana, 83, is all pea coats, cigarette trousers and dainty cardigans, whereas my mum, 59, honed her style on the streets of London‚Äôs Camden and the King‚Äôs Road in the 1980s.  It was these two clashing matriarchs I decided to take shopping when I began the search for that elusive, perfect wedding dress.

Nana wanted lace and beads galore, and if there was anywhere she‚Äôd find her dream dress it would be here. However, styles with all that detailing are too much for me as they bulk out my curves. Upon seeing the embroidered dress (opposite), she did admit it was ‚Äòvery me‚Äô.  Dress, ¬£3,200, Temperley London  Mum wanted me to choose this embroidered dress for my big day. It was the only one that got her excited. Part of me thinks if I hadn‚Äôt tried it on, she would have.  I discovered that despite really loving this gorgeous dress, I felt worried that it didn‚Äôt look ‚Äòbridal‚Äô enough (after all, no one wants to blend in with their wedding guests). Shockingly, my inherited and conflicted style is slowly starting to understand what it wants and, it turns out, much to Nana‚Äôs delight, it‚Äôs a touch of classic. But where to find it?  'Too busy!'

A tulle shrug was ‚Äòtoo busy‚Äô but a dress with tulle wing-style shoulders bigger than my head got the thumbs-up. I agreed. It was sleek, flattering and oh so different! I‚Äôll be back to try this one on again.  Mum wanted to go off-piste with Halfpenny‚Äôs separates, picking an off-the-shoulder corset top with a densely ruffled skirt (above). I think she was going for a punky Vivienne Westwood vibe.

But when that sheer piece of fabric was placed on my head, I felt like a princess!  Nana wanted a dress decked in intricate lacework or laden with beads. This dress elicited a very passionate response: ‚ÄòNow that‚Äôs the kind of bride I want my Stephanie to be!‚Äô she bellowed, all teary.

The then-three-year-old was a page boy alongside Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire and William Ward, while his younger sister Princess Charlotte, two, was one of four flower girls for Pippa's big day with James Matthews, which took place on 20 May 2017 at St Mark's Church, Englefield. To mark Pippa's sixth wedding anniversary, we've looked back at one funny moment between Kate and her kids which was caught on camera.  ¬© Getty Kate was pictured leading the page boys and flower girls into the church  Before the bride arrived and cameras caught sight of Pippa's stunning lace Giles Deacon wedding dress and handmade Maidenhair Fern tiara, her sister and maid of honour Kate helped shepherd the young bridal party inside the church.  But even the short journey from the car to the doors was enough to catch sight of the Princess' parenting skills as she calmed the children down ahead of the ceremony ‚Äì a task she had previously admitted worried her.  Dressed in cream shorts and a white collared shirt, Prince George was spotted making his way through the other page boys and flower girls to the front to grab hold of his mother's hand. He then held onto Charlotte, who looked cute in a Pepa & Co white dress with a pink sash, with his other hand. Watch the moment Kate tried to keep the group, led by George, quiet in the video below‚Ä¶  WATCH: Princess Kate shushes Prince George at Pippa Middleton's wedding  At the Queen's garden party just days before the wedding, Kate told one guest that she was ""a bit worried"" about how her children would behave while carrying out their starring roles.  Pippa and James got married on 20 May 2017  Partygoer Andrew Bates said: ""[Kate] said that they were all really looking forward to her sister's wedding at the weekend but she was a bit worried about how her children might behave. She said she was hopeful that they would be good but you never know at that age.""  After the ceremony, Kate's efforts to make sure her children were behaving were visible once again. She followed behind newlyweds Pippa and James down the path while trying to keep hold of Charlotte's hand, but the tot was too engrossed in emptying the petals out of her wicker basket to listen.  ¬© Getty Princess Kate was Pippa's maid of honour  As they gathered outside the church, the Princess crouched down to share a few words with Charlotte before George came wandering over to his mother waving around his basket in the air.  Pippa and James and their guests then headed off for a lavish reception at nearby Englefield House, a romantic Elizabethan manor where movies such as The Kings Speech and 2012's Great Expectations were filmed.  Guests had been asked to bring a change of clothes for the adults-only evening reception, which started at 7.30 pm at Bucklebury Manor. Set on 18 acres, the grade II-listed Georgian house where Carole and Michael Middleton live served as an idyllic backdrop for the reception, which was attended by about 350 guests.

"wedding","2023-05-20","Not Discerned","{""Chelmsford"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-21T05:00:59","One chaperone service will look after your dog during the ceremony and reception and take it on two walks to 'shake off nerves' during the big day  Gary Jude remembers the first time he photographed a dog at a wedding. It was 2018, in the Essex countryside, and the bride and groom had brought their pet beagle to the reception.  'They were quite outdoorsy people,' he says. 'The dog had on a wax Barbour jacket.' Jude wanted to take group pictures, but the beagle wasn't looking at the camera. 'I had to try to get this dog's attention. I thought, well, I might do what I do with my dogs at home, and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but I went‚Ä¶'  At this point, he takes a deep breath and then makes a string of incomprehensible, high-pitched noises and gurgles. Apparently, the dog loved it.  'He started doing a head tilt and everyone was cracking up.' The 39-year-old wedding photographer might have been 'in a room of 50 people that I'd never met and doing stupid baby dog talking', but he enjoyed himself nonetheless. 'I'm a massive dog person.'  These days, canine-friendly weddings are big business. More venues let dogs attend ceremonies and receptions  Lucky for him, then: last year Jude photographed 40 dogs at one wedding.  The bride and groom had rented a field in North Devon and let guests bring their pets. 'There were dogs running around everywhere,' says Jude.  'I was in my element.' Still, the pet-positive day was not without its issues. Halfway through the groom's speech, one of the hounds cocked his leg against a table in the marquee. Luckily, the bride was fixed on the groom and didn't notice.  These days, canine-friendly weddings are big business. More venues let dogs attend ceremonies and receptions; wedding photographers have dedicated 'dog' sections on their websites, and dog groomers offer pre-wedding pooch pampering.  Smarty Paws, in Nottingham, sells a gold package from ¬£250: dogs have their fur clipped, nails trimmed, ears cleaned and, according to the website, 'cologne applied, if you wish'. (Jude, for what it's worth, didn't have dogs at his own wedding because it was 2013 and the venue didn't allow it.  He was, however, permitted to have a trained barn owl called Rosie swoop down the aisle and deliver the wedding rings ‚Äì swings and roundabouts.)  In 2018, professional dog trainer Lizzie Benge set up Here Comes The Hound, a chaperone service for dogs at weddings.  Benge, 39, is based in Kent, but she and her business partner Claire travel around the country to work the wedding canine circuit. Their services aren't cheap: a full-day package costs ¬£550.  So what do you get for your money? First, Benge offers a pre-wedding 'consultation' with the bride, groom and dog, to get to know the animal and find out what the couple want.  On the wedding day, Benge will look after the dog throughout the ceremony and reception, drive it between venues, get it to cooperate during photos and take it on two walks  Then, on the wedding day, she will look after the dog throughout the ceremony and reception, drive it between venues, get it to cooperate during photos, and give it two hour-long walks ‚Äì one in the morning and one in the afternoon ‚Äì 'to shake off the big-day nerves'.  She also can, if requested, release the dog down the church aisle with the wedding rings attached to its neck.  And, for an extra ¬£100, there's an overnight service, 'including sofa cuddles, yummy dinner, sleepover fun, a morning-after 90-minute walk and taxi back home or to the honeymoon holiday home'. Last year,  Benge worked at 16 weddings; she promises all the dogs behaved immaculately.  Naturally, I have a lot of questions. How does Benge get the dogs to behave for photographs? 'We come armed with squeaky toys, balls and treats.'  How many dogs can she look after in one go? It depends on how big and well behaved they are; she once chaperoned three labradors, with the aid of a colleague.  Which breed is the most popular? 'Cockapoos are everywhere. Or some variation on poo: cavapoo, shih-poo.' Are there any breeds she hates working with?  'I would never say no to any type of dog,' she says, diplomatically, before adding:  'I wouldn't particularly want to work with chihuahuas. Only because they're normally quite nervous. People want them in their day, but I'm not really sure that chihuahuas want to be a part of their day.'  I WOULDN'T WANT TO WORK WITH CHIHUAHUAS ‚Äì THEY'RE NERVOUS  And the biggest questions of all: why would someone want their dog at their wedding? And why would they pay north of ¬£500 to do it?  Lockdown, probably. If the country was already dog mad, spending endless hours trapped with our dogs has only made us dog madder.  Between March and September 2020, 2.2 million dogs were bought in the UK; by 2021, Britain's canine population had risen by more than ten per cent. And, thanks to working from home, so many of those lockdown puppies grew up never being on their own.  'It's a double-edged sword,' says Benge. 'I think it's lovely that people care so much about their dogs. But I also believe that, from the animals' point of view, they need to learn to be left by themselves.'  Still, your wedding isn't an ordinary day, and, if you want your pet there, you may as well do it in style.  That said, there are some animals that Benge thinks are best left at home ‚Äì wedding day or not. When I ask if she would consider expanding business to chaperoning cats any earlier displays of diplomacy are abandoned.  'No!' says Benge, laughing. 'I just don't think that's a good idea.'

A second replied: ""There is no such thing as too strict. There are millions of colors. Pick any of them but white. Too strict would be banning white dress shirts.""

""We were going try to save up money this year to get married next year, but it was looking like nan might not be here. First, we decided to do a pretend wedding where we dress up and get the staff pretend to be the vicar. But then we decided to do it properly - with her walking me down the aisle,"" Bianca was quoted as saying by Metro.  She added that the decision to marry in the care home was sudden and it resulted in a rush to get everything together in time.  The couple were helped by the care home staff and their loved ones in organising the wedding. Bianca said their budget was low but they could borrow things from others  ""We didn't have a lot of money so we asked if we could borrow things from people - and the outcome was so, so overwhelming,"" she said.  On the big day, a generous friend lent them his car and Bianca borrowed her dress from a local hospice. They also got marquees, chairs and a gazebo from friends.  ""Getting married in a care home isn't something you do - so everyone on the day was really shocked at how beautiful it looked,"" said Bianca.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aW1lc25vd25ld3MuY29tL3ZpcmFsL2NvdXBsZS1ob2xkLXdlZGRpbmctaW4tY2FyZS1ob21lLWZvci1icmlkZXMtYWlsaW5nLWdyZWF0LWdyYW5kbW90aGVyLXRvLXdhbGstaGVyLWRvd24tdGhlLWFpc2xlLWFydGljbGUtMTAwMzkxNDUz0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzbm93bmV3cy5jb20vdmlyYWwvY291cGxlLWhvbGQtd2VkZGluZy1pbi1jYXJlLWhvbWUtZm9yLWJyaWRlcy1haWxpbmctZ3JlYXQtZ3JhbmRtb3RoZXItdG8td2Fsay1oZXItZG93bi10aGUtYWlzbGUtYXJ0aWNsZS0xMDAzOTE0NTMvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The beef, chicken, or fish-plated dinners have gone by the wayside in favor of non-traditional options like a taco food trucks or pasta bars. But surely the crown jewel of the wedding dining experience, the wedding cake, will endure the test of time, right? It seems less and less likely over time as folks reject many of the nuptial rituals and look for customized dessert menus.  Engaged couples are also likely to reject wedding cakes because they are astronomically expensive, costing $350 on average, says Brides. And the tiered masterpieces that have been a staple in weddings also have a reputation for being a tad flavorless and boring, not to mention generic. For a while, that meant the soon-to-be-wed would go for modern cake styles, favoring bold floral decorations, distinctive techniques like stucco frosting, and unique flavors such as pumpkin spice latte cake with cream cheese frosting. Now those are very common and read as just as nondescript as their predecessors. And as the general trend in weddings is that most couples want each aspect of the wedding to be catered to their unique tastes and interests, the traditional wedding cake is out in favor of more quirky, memorable dessert options.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTI4NzU3OC9sZXRzLWhvbmVzdC13ZWRkaW5nLWNha2VzLW92ZXIv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lifestyle influencer Cora Breilein recently shared how she'd made her answer to the question 'can I bring a date?' crystal clear in the invite, specifying that they would not be including a plus-one option for guests as they wanted their wedding to be ""intimate"".  In a screengrab of the guideline shared in a TikTok post, Cora's guests were advised: ""If your partner is invited their name is included on your Save the Date and formal invitation."" This rule, unfortunately, didn't go down too well with everyone.  Cora, who goes by the username @corabrei, revealed: ""Lost a 7+ year friendship over not inviting a bf I never met.

"wedding","2023-05-20","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-20T15:32:36","A group of Cape Hatteras Elementary third-grade students made a remarkable and unexpected discovery of a 17th-century wedding ring while on a field trip to the new Lost Colony Museum and Gift Shop in Buxton.  Scott Dawson, museum owner and author of The Lost Colony and Hatteras Island, engaged the 18 students and their teacher Jordyn Fenner with a few interactive activities during their visit, and that included an opportunity to sift through some of the residue of previous archaeological digs from a site in Buxton.  ‚ÄúWhen we do archaeology in the field, we get the big artifacts, and we catch the really small stuff through a mosquito screen so we can sift through it later,‚Äù said Dawson.  Archaeological digs have been conducted several times a year at an undisclosed Buxton site since 2009, under the guidance of renowned experts from around the globe.  The timeframe of the artifacts is determined by the layer of subterranean turf where they are found, and the bucket of small pieces that the students sifted through was from the 1610s-1640s.  Among the tiny animal teeth and fish vertebrae, the students discovered a few new treasures.  ‚ÄúThey ended up finding a musket ball, and a blue Venetian bead, and a piece of silver which we think is part of a wedding ring,‚Äù said Dawson. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not unusual to find a musket ball or a bead, but a wedding ring is something else entirely.‚Äù  The small half-sliver of metal had a portion of a setting intact, and while Dawson recognized the find as a rare ring, he contacted Professor Mark Horton of England‚Äôs University of Bristol ‚Äì one of the top archaeologists in the world ‚Äì to confirm the discovery. ‚ÄúHe wrote back and said ‚ÄòI think it could be a ring‚Äô‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs sterling silver, and that‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs Native American,‚Äù said Dawson.  ‚ÄúThe kids took [the project] very seriously, so it‚Äôs exciting that they found something so unusual.‚Äù  The Lost Colony Museum officially launched in the spring of 2023 as an initiative to share Hatteras Island‚Äôs distinctive place in the familiar story of the early English colonists.  Filled with hundreds of artifacts, documents, and interactive displays that share insights from global experts, the museum uncovers the major role that Hatteras Island and the original Croatoans had in the English‚Äôs initial visits and later colonization of America.  ‚ÄúWe should be more famous than Plymouth Rock,‚Äù said Dawson. ‚ÄúWe are Manteo‚Äôs hometown. So we‚Äôre trying to be a little more inclusive, and to tell the story from a new, native perspective.‚Äù  The museum also aims to erase a decades-old myth that no one knows what happened to the Lost Colonists of Roanoke Island, who disappeared in 1587 after carving the word ‚ÄúCROATOAN‚Äù into a palisade ‚Äì an indication that they were heading south to Hatteras Island.  Per Dawson, there were multiple English journeys to the Outer Banks prior to the Lost Colony, with the first English visitors landing in modern-day Buxton in 1584. Manteo was actually from Hatteras Island, and instead of warring with the colonists, Manteo served as an ambassador, making two trips across the pond to build relationships with the new English arrivals, and earning a Lordship in the process.  ‚ÄúThe English made multiple journeys to Hatteras Island before [the Lost Colony], so having a story where we don‚Äôt talk about what happened in 1584, 1585, and 1586 is like telling the story about the Titanic, but leaving out the iceberg,‚Äù said Dawson. ‚ÄúPeople would wonder how the Titanic sank, and would debate how it [disappeared], but it‚Äôs a fact that we already know.‚Äù  Since opening, the museum has continually expanded, with a new display case arriving soon, and donations being collected for a second display case to showcase the many local artifacts. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good problem to have when you have so many artifacts that you need two cases,‚Äù said Dawson.  And while the CHES third grade class was the very first school group to visit the museum ‚Äì making a remarkable discovery to boot in the process ‚Äì Dawson hopes that they won‚Äôt be the last.  ‚ÄúI would like for all the Dare County Schools, and any school really, to come and visit, but especially our Hatteras Island [students],‚Äù said Dawson. ‚ÄúThis is their heritage, and if they come away knowing a little bit more about how important Hatteras Island and the Croatoans were in history, it is very much worth it.‚Äù  For more information, and how you can help:","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL2lzbGFuZGZyZWVwcmVzcy5vcmcvaGF0dGVyYXMtaXNsYW5kLWZlYXR1cmVzL2NhcGUtaGF0dGVyYXMtc3R1ZGVudHMtZGlzY292ZXItYS0xN3RoLWNlbnR1cnktd2VkZGluZy1yaW5nLXdoaWxlLXZpc2l0aW5nLXRoZS1uZXctbG9zdC1jb2xvbnktbXVzZXVtL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","2023-05-21T06:34:49","By Josh Katzowitz, WCI Content Director  Need to get caught up on the first two parts of our From Fourth Year to the Real World series? Here‚Äôs part 1 which introduces the ones we follow and part 2 which tells the tale of them transitioning from medical school to residency.  In the months before their friends and family joined together to raise a toast in appreciation and optimism, Ariel was super stressed about the party that was to celebrate the marriage between her and Danny.  It was her intern year, so her medical training was already intense and sometimes overwhelming, and the couple owe hundreds of thousands of dollars in combined student loan debt. Ariel‚Äôs father had agreed to pay for their April 2023 wedding celebration, but she was mostly the one to plan it and to try to keep it within the $80,000 budget.  Ariel felt herself in a downward spiral, caused by the stress of the party, the steep learning curve of her intern year, and the guilt that her retired father was the one paying the bills.  ‚ÄúIt was horrible,‚Äù Ariel said. ‚ÄúThe crux of the problem was the financial stress on my dad. Knowing he could handle it but still feeling bad and burdening him with such a large amount of money in such a short amount of time. I went to therapy every week in that two- or three-month time frame.‚Äù  Growing up, Ariel didn‚Äôt care about having such a grand wedding, but when her wealthy father a year earlier had given her a choice between him paying off the remainder of her medical school loans (about $90,000 worth) or an extravagant wedding, she chose the latter. In the leadup to it, she began having doubts.  ‚ÄúI thought it was such a waste of money,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf he had paid for school, even if it was $20,000-$30,000 more, I would have been fine with it.‚Äù  Ava and Patrick also had separate awakenings this year. In the month leading up to her intern year in 2022, Ava, even with a new job and impending imposter syndrome on the horizon, was calm. You could have even described her as ‚Äúchill.‚Äù A year later, Ava can‚Äôt believe how na√Øve she had been.  Meanwhile, a year ago, Patrick‚Äôs wife had just welcomed their third child into the family, and with an enormous amount of student loan debt, a new house in a new part of the country, and a $14,000 IRS refund check that seemed to be lost in the mail, his life was full of stress‚Äîand this was even before he started his new job. Now, even with a fourth child on the way, Patrick has never been more comfortable with his financial standing and what he sees as his family‚Äôs future.  In the time since WCI last caught up with the four medical-students-turned-interns, they‚Äôve all made incredible strides in their lives, in their careers, and in their finances. Their attitudes, though, run the gamut from unprecedented comfort to unyielding burnout. For all of these interns, the last year has been filled with bumps and bruises, and yet, all of them have survived their first year of residency intact. They can all smile about it now.  The First Year of Residency  In February 2022, we started a new series called From Fourth Year to the Real World where I write about a quartet of graduating medical students who have begun their residencies.  Since they‚Äôre completely transparent with how much they owe and how much they make‚Äîand with how they‚Äôre mapping out their financial futures‚Äîwe aren‚Äôt using their real names. We check in with these newly minted doctors occasionally, and today, they‚Äôre reminiscing on their intern years and how they utilized their new resident‚Äôs salaries while, in their own words, they began learning how to adult.  Here‚Äôs a quick introduction to the ones we follow:  Ariel and Danny: This newly married couple owe close to $400,000 in student loans, and they‚Äôve just officially joined their lives (if not their financial accounts) together in matrimony. They earn about $100,000 together, and they‚Äôve come through a stressful year while maintaining their individuality.  Ava: For the first time in her life, Ava made a solid salary (she earned $60,000 as an intern, and that will bump up to $65,000 in her second year), but she‚Äôs learned plenty about herself in the past 12 months. She‚Äôs not a big spender, and the new money was nice, particularly since she doesn't have any student loan debt. But she also nearly burned herself out during her intern year.  Patrick: He won‚Äôt become an attending until he‚Äôs in his mid-30s, and Patrick owes nearly $500,000 in medical school loans. Patrick will soon be a father of four boys, and he juggles his parental responsibilities with his wife, Brittany, who makes more money than him as a nurse.  Ariel and Danny Bonded Together While Maintaining Some Separation  There‚Äôs little doubt that Ariel and Danny are comfortable with their new financial status. She‚Äôs enjoying her annual pass to one of the country‚Äôs top-notch amusement parks, and Danny bought season tickets to the local major college football program. They sit together on the couch of their $1,900-per-month apartment on this day, and they look at ease. They have jobs. They have friends. They can do what they want when they want because they have money and because they‚Äôre not currently having to pay off student loan debt.  They‚Äôre married, so they‚Äôre bonded together. But they‚Äôve maintained separate accounts. No joint checking, no joint savings, no joint brokerage account. One pays for groceries, and the other reimburses them through Zelle.  There have been discussions about possibly opening an account to which they both have access, especially now that they received $13,000 in wedding gifts (at the moment, that total is in Ariel‚Äôs account). But they eat separate dinners‚ÄîAriel will make a big batch of chicken that she then can use for lunch over the next few days; Danny is more content with a ground beef offering that he might scarf down all at once. And their money is isolated as well.  ‚ÄúHaving checks with the same name, that would be nice,‚Äù Danny thought aloud. Said Ariel: ‚ÄúMy aunts and uncles think it‚Äôs strange. But we have different habits. I‚Äôm not bothered by his. He‚Äôs not bothered by mine. We make the same amount of money. We just don‚Äôt need to put it in the same pile.‚Äù  Maybe the decision to keep their finances separate is generational. Born in the mid-1990s, they‚Äôre among the youngest millennials, and perhaps that generation is more apt to remain financially independent from their spouse. Or maybe it has something to do with how they were raised.  Danny‚Äôs father was a truck driver‚Äîhe‚Äôs still working in his mid-60s on overnight shifts‚Äîand his mom was a stay-at-home spouse before finding work as a grocery store cashier. His family didn‚Äôt have wealth. Danny worked while he was in college, and he lived at home to save money. He comes from a blue-collar upbringing.  Ariel‚Äôs father, meanwhile, was rich.  Danny made it clear before they were married that his student loan debt was his alone. He didn‚Äôt want Ariel‚Äôs money (or, indirectly, her father‚Äôs wealth) to pay off what he owed. Even though they both make the same amount of money as residents (together, they earned $98,000 as interns), they are simply more comfortable with this setup.  How and when to pay off those student loans is still a question. Thanks to the federal government‚Äôs student loan holiday and the frozen interest rates, Danny has been making $0 payments. When student loan payments resume, potentially later in 2023, he figures he‚Äôll pay about $370 per month. He‚Äôs considering trying for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. It might not be worth it for Ariel since she‚Äôs only in a three-year residency and might not want to work for the government or a nonprofit. But Danny‚Äôs residency is a year longer, and he might add on a fellowship that could take him 50%-60% of the way toward PSLF and getting his loans forgiven 10 years after he graduates from medical school.  Otherwise, the two are secure. Ariel is budgeting (and up until the wedding, she was actually sticking with it), but they‚Äôre not aggressively saving. They‚Äôre contributing to their 401(a) retirement plans‚Äîunfortunately, they‚Äôre not getting a match from their employer‚Äîand they‚Äôre contemplating opening Roth IRAs.  ‚ÄúI have a cushion now,‚Äù Danny said. ‚ÄúIf anything comes up, we can afford it. If the car goes out, we can afford it.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd we have that $13,000,‚Äù Ariel reminded.  The two have newfound financial freedom, and they don‚Äôt have to answer to anybody (not even each other). They‚Äôre joined together in matrimony, and they have separate accounts. They‚Äôve worked hard, and they‚Äôre not necessarily looking to skimp.  ‚ÄúI hear all the attendings say that we‚Äôre going to be a two-physician household,‚Äù Ariel said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs just spend the money now.‚Äô‚Äù  In a Better Spot Than Ever Before  Spending money now? Yes, Patrick knows a little something about that.  Though Patrick and his wife Brittany have maintained an emergency fund of at least $5,000 in his first year of residency, the costs continue to get more intense. Patrick grew up in a household that was always worried about money (he heard his father vomiting from stress in the middle of the night, and if he would have asked his dad for a snack at a gas station, ‚Äúthere was no way in hell that was going to happen‚Äù).  But now, he can realistically say that he‚Äôs in a more comfortable financial spot than ever before.  Patrick earned $58,500 last year (that‚Äôll increase to $64,000 for second year), and‚Äîthanks to her full-time salary, her signing bonus, and her moving stipend‚ÄîBrittany made about six figures at her nursing job in the past year. Yes, their student loan debt of $460,000 is still sitting there untouched, but Patrick hasn‚Äôt felt pinched by paying their bills and splurging on the occasional vacation.  As he‚Äôs talking, his second-oldest child is playing with the remote control to the ceiling fan, popping his head in and out of view of the computer‚Äôs camera. Patrick is working nights this week, so he‚Äôs taking care of his two youngest kids. But childcare is still expensive, and it‚Äôs about to cost the family even more when Brittany has their fourth child and transitions to part-time work in the next several months.  Their oldest child is in kindergarten, and though there‚Äôs a childcare center right in their neighborhood, that convenience costs $3,000 per month. They‚Äôve eschewed that and instead pay a babysitter $20 per hour for two of the kids and $25 if she‚Äôs watching all three. That costs them $300 per week, but even more stressful is the fact that they‚Äôve already burned through a few babysitters this year until they found the right fit.  Patrick figures he averages fewer than five hours of sleep per night with Brittany getting even less. When she‚Äôs on an overnight nursing shift, she gets home at about 8am, falls asleep by 9, and then awakens at 2pm to pick up the oldest from kindergarten.  Stress, exhaustion, and burnout? Yes, Patrick and Brittany know a little something about that.  ‚ÄúWe are burnt out,‚Äù Patrick said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not sustainable any longer.‚Äù  Patrick, though, remains appreciative and optimistic.  Although the family will lose some of her salary when Brittany transitions to part-time work, Patrick plans to moonlight as much as possible a year from now when third year begins. If he covers one inpatient unit for the weekend, he can make $2,000. Do that a couple of times per month, and he‚Äôs suddenly replaced Brittany‚Äôs income (and maybe she can even stop working altogether). Plus, when he‚Äôs a third-year, he can arrive at work an hour early and make $160 to see a new patient or $80 to follow up with one who‚Äôs already established. He can stay two extra hours after his shift and earn the same money. He can eventually conduct ED admissions while working from home and make $115 per hour through the wonders of telehealth.  ‚ÄúOnce third year rolls around, I‚Äôd be fine working from 7am to 8pm if I need to 2-3 days a week and do 2-3 weekends a month,‚Äù Patrick said. ‚ÄúIf my wife is still working, we‚Äôd have more than enough money. But it has not been nearly as stressful as I anticipated it would be. We have that surety of a stable income.‚Äù  But what about his loans? For now, it‚Äôs all in deferment, but he‚Äôll likely try for PSLF eventually. While he‚Äôs in residency and a possible fellowship, he figures he‚Äôll end up paying close to $9,000 a year. By the time he can apply for PSLF, he‚Äôs hoping about $240,000 would be forgiven.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not scaring me nearly as bad it was before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBefore, it was this huge number; how can I attack it? But once you get looking at the attending salaries, you realize that as long as I don‚Äôt upgrade my life extravagantly, I could pay this off pretty reasonably within 5-10 years. I‚Äôll finish residency at 36, so I‚Äôd be in my 40s when I pay them off. I‚Äôd probably be getting greedy; I‚Äôd want a nicer house and a Tesla. But it‚Äôs those extravagant wants that you need to check.‚Äù  Growing up, his parents worried about where the next paycheck was coming from, and no matter how hard they worked, they didn‚Äôt have much earning potential. They didn't have much room to breathe. Patrick has a different mindset.  No. 1, he‚Äôs not scared of intense labor. In college, he worked at a moving company, and sometimes he put in 80-90 hours per week of schlepping furniture around. No. 2, he knows that in a few years, he‚Äôll be earning hundreds of thousands of dollars.  That‚Äôs why his future is so freeing.  ‚ÄúWe still have to exercise some restraint,‚Äù Patrick said. ‚ÄúThere are things we want that we‚Äôre not getting right now. But that‚Äôs different than saying, ‚ÄòShoot, the credit card bill is running up. We have to pay for this soon, but we don‚Äôt have the money.‚Äô That‚Äôs a different feeling than us saying, ‚ÄòOh, we can‚Äôt buy a hot tub yet.‚Äô‚Äù  Patrick and Brittany have never been at a point where they have this little amount of financial stress. But a new baby is coming. The mortgage on their 1,800-square foot house still needs to be paid. Diapers and baby wipes could be as much as $200 a month. Baby formula is astronomical.  Yes, Patrick, who knows residents who can earn up to $200,000 of extra income, has grand plans to moonlight as much as possible by the fall of 2024. But the specter of true physician burnout is never far away; it can still pop in and out of view before you realize what's happening. Patrick still needs to figure out a way to make space in his life to relax and spend time with his growing family. He still needs to figure out a way to breathe.  What Ava Didn‚Äôt Know About Life and Medicine  When looking back at her first year of residency, Ava takes in a deep breath, reminisces about her mindset only 11 months earlier, and exhales in wonder at how little she knew about what was to happen.  Ava was supposed to move into a newly built apartment only a few days before she started her first rotation of intern year. She was fine with that. But the move-in date kept getting pushed back, and eventually, she realized that she was going to be homeless unless she acted soon. With a week to go before she started her neuro-radiology rotation, she began frantically searching for another apartment to sublet.  The stress of her intern year never subsided.  ‚ÄúI was,‚Äù Ava says now, ‚Äúa little bit na√Øve.‚Äù  Ava grew up as a world traveler, living in wealthy countries like Oman and the UAE and in poorer areas in Bolivia and Venezuela. Her family avoided a lifestyle of big spending and they saved their money, habits that have followed Ava into her mid-20s. She‚Äôs in a better financial position than most, because thanks to a half-scholarship to medical school and her parents‚Äô willingness to cover the rest of her tuition and living expenses, she has no student loan debt.  Her parents didn‚Äôt teach her much about money, but she is still utilizing their indirect lessons on saving. She‚Äôs putting 5% of her salary into her Roth 401(k), and she gets a match from her employer. One paycheck a month goes toward paying her rent. The other is hers to spend and save. She likes seeing at least $5,000 in her checking account, so even though she might occasionally buy a $300 dress or spend $200 on a haircut, she‚Äôs still driving the same 2016 Volkswagen she‚Äôs owned since college. She‚Äôs also never had to ask her parents for money, and for that, she feels proud.  Those relatively sparse spending habits allowed her to buy a $2,000 plane ticket so she could spend a month in her native Argentina in 2022. She‚Äôs going to Mexico on vacation soon, and when we spoke, she was in the process of planning a trip to Portugal ‚Äîafter her $1,600 plane ticket, she‚Äôs budgeted $2,000 for two weeks as Ava and two of her pals drive the Iberian peninsula coast while avoiding fancy hotels and dinners.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a big spender,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never had a big budget to spend. And if I‚Äôm working 12 hours a day on six-day work weeks, I don‚Äôt have time. That‚Äôs been helpful, too.‚Äù  Well, that intense workflow has been helpful in some ways. In other ways, though, it‚Äôs forced Ava to reckon with her work-life balance and how to navigate her intern-year burnout.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize how sheltered I was in medical school,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMedicine is really glorified in medical school, and you start residency and you think, ‚ÄòThis isn‚Äôt as magical as I thought it was going to be.‚Äô‚Äù  This year, Ava has learned about the failures of the healthcare system; how some people don‚Äôt have access to care; the insurance costs of medicine; and how difficult it is to find, build, and sustain relationships when you‚Äôre not working. She learned a $3,000 mistake when she went to an urgent care this year for help with a gastric ulcer. She was shucked into the real world without an apartment, where she‚Äôd work long hours and then collapse into bed after she got home. Her one-year relationship with a boyfriend fell apart.  At the same time, she likes residency more than she enjoyed medical school. She‚Äôs made connections with patients. She‚Äôs been motivated by them. She‚Äôs felt rewarded by them.  ‚ÄúYou have this incredible opportunity to be by people‚Äôs side at their most vulnerable,‚Äù Ava said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly rewarding. That‚Äôs what has kept me motivated.‚Äù  Like all the fourth years who have now spent a year in the real world, Ava has grown as a doctor and learned more about herself as a person. She and Patrick battled through burnout. Ariel sought weekly therapy. Danny had to reckon with the economic help he received from his father-in-law.  They‚Äôve all lived to talk about it, and their transformation as doctors and as people since the last time we caught up with them is striking.  They‚Äôve got money in the bank. They can enjoy their lives away from work, or they‚Äôre trying their best to learn how. They‚Äôre appreciative and optimistic, and they‚Äôre grateful that the journey ‚Äîand all of the unforeseen barriers that are sure to keep coming their way ‚Äîwill continue.  Make sure to get caught up on part 1 and part 2 of our From Fourth Year to the Real World series.

They had previously advertised the wedding on social media, including the date, and we wondered if we would be invited. We weren‚Äôt, which was totally fine because of our limited budget.  Then, two weeks before the wedding date, we received an email inviting us to watch it virtually. We already had plans that night, but because we care for this family, we tried to bend things so we could watch it. Unfortunately, the video feed for the reception was all goofed up. We couldn‚Äôt really see it, and then we just got a replay reel at the end.  What would you say the suggested gift amount is in that situation?

Miss Manners: Why is it rude to wash your hands in the kitchen? Advice | Miss Manners: Can I dance in the aisle while my husband sits? For a normal wedding, I think it‚Äôs $200, but that is a bit out of our league, and the whole thing was very hodgepodge. My husband wants to send $25, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an insult.  GENTLE READER: It is if you send it in cash. But the monetary equivalent, in the form of an even minimally thought-out present, will be far less obvious in its intended message. Which is, of course, that a virtual wedding was not worth a higher price of admission.  DEAR MISS MANNERS: My mother has an active social life, with multiple friendships that have lasted decades. I have been assured that I have met these ladies, but that I was ‚Äújust a baby‚Äù at the time.  I have been blessed with two children in the last two years, and these kind ladies give my mother presents for my children. My mom brings some present from them practically every other week.  Some presents become a beloved favorite toy, while others miss the mark. That‚Äôs to be expected of gifts from strangers. My mom then urges me to write thank-you notes to her friends.  These are unsolicited gifts from strangers. I have two young children and I do not have the time to sit down and write thank-you notes to people I don‚Äôt know.  I feel that these gifts are actually meant for the grandmother to give the grandchild ‚Äî not for the mother and the child, with the grandmother acting as a delivery service. Thus, I feel that if my mom wants them to receive a thank-you note, she should be the one to write it.  GENTLE READER: Has it become so commonplace to explicitly solicit presents that we have become resentful when people give them spontaneously ‚Äî and for the sheer pleasure of it?  Never mind; Miss Manners knows the answer all too well.  Yes, these inconsiderate strangers are using your children as a conduit for expressing their affection for your mother. How rude.  If you really want the presents to stop, by all means, make your mother look bad and cease writing thank-you letters. But know that since the relative success rate of these presents is fairly high (although it should not matter), you will also be punishing your children.  The good news is that if you just hold out a couple more years, your children will be old enough to write the letters themselves. Then you can have the pleasure of nagging them.

"wedding","2023-05-20","16:00:00","{""Redding"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:27:02","A beautiful wedding at Meadowbrook Ranch last Saturday when Taylor Collins and Chase Bunn were married. For years I have driven past the bronze bucking horse statue as we drove to and from our Susanville ranch when the cattle were shipped to the mountains. This was the first time to be on the ranch, and it was amazing. It is much larger than what we see from Highway 36E as we drive up the hill. We were at the far eastern end of the meadow with a creek flowing past, and Angus cattle grazing in a pasture to the south of where the wedding was held. Across the creek were beautiful bluffs rising to the north.  It was an outdoor wedding, and the sun was hot at 4 p.m. but it wasn‚Äôt raining like the previous week when we were at the Junior Livestock Auction.  Years ago I attended a wedding when the bride arrived in a horse drawn carriage, however Taylor arrived in a viper red Peterbilt 389 with brushed black strips, powered by a high-torque X15 hooked to an 18-speed, a 280 inch wheelbase, and it lowered when stopped. The truck license plate was ‚ÄòMrs Cone.‚Äô Bruce and Kellie Cone of Cone Trucking, Redding, had loaned Mike Collins the beautiful truck for the wedding. Their arrival had a rhythmic sound coming from the truck. It was awesome!  For newcomers to Tehama County, grandfather Mike Collins has a truck and has hauled livestock across the nation, as well as known for the delicious meals at many brandings and social functions. Mike and Teri also have a fence building company as does the groom.  When we arrived, the guestbook on table was near a stock trailer where gifts were placed. Then we were asked to sign a cloth square for a quilt that will be made.  The officiants of the wedding ceremony were JB Stacy and James Miller. Best man was Garret Boyd, with groomsmen Jack Simonis, Jake Cunningham, Ben Urricelqui, Kent Johnson, and Zack Cunningham.  Ring bearers in white shirt, red suspenders and Levis were Meyer Cunningham and Ayker Fitze.  Maid of Honor was Sami Stabile and Matron of Honor was Alek Fitze. Bridesmaids in burgundy gowns were Kilee Birt, Macey Bunn, Madison Waelty and Courtny Grames.  Three little girls in white dresses were the flower girls. The tiniest was Stevi Birt, daughter of Brian and Lynsie Collins Birt, with Quincy and Karsyn Cunningham, cousins of the groom.  Taylor is the daughter of Jenifer and Bryon Waelty. She has been a Chamber Ambassador and I see her at Good Morning Red Bluff each month. She works at Summit Funding.  Chase is son of Wade and Gwen Bunn, and has Bunn Fencing.  There were many children at the wedding and there was a Bounce House for them to enjoy, while we enjoyed beverages or bottled water in the shade.  When Linda Walker and I started to bring our chairs over to the shade. James Boyd rescued us and carried the chairs.  Our table was near the dance floor and bridal table, where I had an opportunity to visit with Mike‚Äôs 93-year-old aunt Joy White from Yuma, Arizona. Guests at the wedding had also come from Florida, Oklahoma, Nevada, Colorado, Idaho and multiple other states.  Mike‚Äôs kitchen crew prepared the delicious beef dinner. Taylor and Chase greeted each guest as they handed the dinner plates to usWhat a clever idea, to be able to greet everyone and we could say ‚ÄúCongratulations‚Äù to them!  It was a beautiful wedding.  Teri Collins used social media to express her thoughts and say thank you.  ‚Äú‚ÄùThe Lord saw fit to bless us in so many ways, that we would like to take the opportunity to Thank some of the most amazing people for helping bring Taylor & Chase Bunn‚Äôs day from a drawing on paper to reality‚Ä¶.to the cooking crew that kept their promise to Taylor for keeping Mike out of an apron: Tony & Linette, Casey & Clint aka Big Fella, Larry & Dolores, John & Candie, Greg & Jenny, Roy & Casey, Alex, Katlin, Amy, Nichole, Felicia & John. Last but not least, Lee Shope for everything he did the whole week before the big day. The Cline family for giving us one of the most beautiful places in Red Bluff to celebrate a dream come true.

"wedding","1921-01-24","Not Discerned","{""Newark"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T10:05:30","Doug Stout  Guest Columnist  On June 17, 1919, First Lieutenant Frederick Fleek Wright boarded the U.S.S. Antigone at the port of St. Nazaire, France for his return to the United States. He arrived in New York on June 28. On July 29, he received his discharge from the Army and returned to his job at the First National Bank in Newark.  On Monday evening, Jan. 24, 1921, Frederick married Mary Elizabeth Carl at the Second Presbyterian Church in Newark. ‚ÄúThe bride,‚Äù according to The Newark Advocate, ‚Äúis the only daughter of Mr. Louis F. Carl of West Church Street. She was a student at Ward Belmont school [in] Nashville, Tennessee.‚Äù  Mary‚Äôs mother, Fannie, had passed away but was from a well-known family in Newark. Fannie was born in Newark in 1866 to Eli and Jemima Hull. Eli became a major developer in Newark. She had a much older brother who was a minister, and a younger sister that the Hulls had adopted, Laura Mae. Laura married William Wehrle, the cofounder of the Wehrle Stove Company.  In 1888, Fannie married Louis Carl. Louis was employed by the Logan Gas Company and eventually became the head of that business. Mary was born in 1898, their only child.  Tragedy struck the family 10 years later when they were living at 116 West Church Street. Fannie was raking and burning leaves in the yard when her dress caught fire. She was severely burned and died of her injuries on Dec. 17, 1908, just two days before her 20th wedding anniversary. According to family historian Gill Miller, ‚ÄúLittle Mary was, of course, in the custody of her father, but was cared for by mother‚Äôs sister, ‚ÄòAunt Laura Wehrle,‚Äô who had had only one child who died immediately post-birth in 1905.‚Äù  But Mary and Frederick's wedding day in 1921 was a happy one, according to the article that covered the prestigious families in the social column of The Advocate.  The colors for the wedding were described as a ‚Äúdeftly harmonizing rainbow‚Äù with ‚Äúcolors [of] green, gold and lavender. The altar was banked with a profusion of gorgeous palms and ferns, while large garlands of southern smilax were used in every available space. Loops of the smilax caught on the pews outlining the aisles. In the bower of greenery on the altar, candlelight glowed from numerous tall silver candle sticks. The bridal gown was of white chiffon velvet, fashioned with the short skirt and [a] full-length panel train that was caught at the shoulders. The only trimming was a touch of real lace. A great shower of a bouquet of orchids, lilies of the valley, and white sweet peas completed the costume.‚Äù  The family names mentioned in the column were a veritable who‚Äôs who of Licking County at the time.  The newlyweds left for the East Coast and took a ship to Europe. According to their passport application, the couple planned to return in about six months. They listed the countries that they wanted to see as Italy, Spain, Greece and France. Turkey was also listed but appears to have been crossed out.  The trip seems to have been successful. In March of 1922, the Wrights presented a program to the ‚ÄúMonday Talks‚Äù club at the library where Frederick was to present on, ‚ÄúThe Mediterranean Trip,‚Äù while Mary provided ‚Äúmusical selections.‚Äù  The trip also produced a son, Frederick Wehrle Wright. He was born in Newark on Dec. 3, 1921. Unbeknownst to the family, ‚ÄúLittle Frederick,‚Äù as he was known, would be the next soldier in the family.

"wedding","2023-05-18","15:00:00","{""Cleveland"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T09:24:00","CLEVELAND, Ohio ‚Äì I received this letter from Steve (not his real name):  ‚ÄúWe have been planning my youngest daughter‚Äôs wedding for the past year. A month before the wedding ‚Äì on the plane home from her bachelorette party ‚Äì she received a text message from a woman informing her that her fianc√© has been cheating on her. Wedding canceled.  ‚ÄúMy daughter‚Äôs heart is broken in half. Our family devastated. Her friends devastated. Wedding guests informed. Thousands of dollars in wedding expenses non-refundable. There are worse things, but this is hard. We will support and love our daughter to get through it.‚Äù  As I read Steve‚Äôs email, my first thought was, ‚ÄúWas the woman who texted the report of cheating telling the truth?‚Äù  I emailed Steve for more information. He wrote:  ‚ÄúThe text was from the woman my daughter‚Äôs fianc√© cheated with. We have since found out she contacted my daughter because she was trying to ‚Äòdo the right thing.‚Äô The fiance‚Äô told her his real name, so she curiously looked looked him up on Facebook and saw he was engaged to my daughter.‚Äù  THE COST OF A WEDDING  I called Reverend John Lentz of Forest Hill Presbyterian Church in Cleveland Heights, and read him Steve‚Äôs emails.  ‚ÄúMy heart breaks for her and her father,‚Äù said Lentz. ‚ÄúThey obviously did the right thing calling it off. That can be hard, because some of these elaborate weddings are planned two years in advance. It‚Äôs a huge industry and can be very expensive.‚Äù  Canceling a wedding can lead to embarrassment and a financial loss, even if it‚Äôs for all the right reasons.  A story by cleveland.com‚Äôs Jane Morice states the average cost of a wedding nationally is $30,000. In Ohio, it‚Äôs $26,000.  Lentz insists meeting with couples for counseling before he marries them. A few times, it was clear one of the people had substance-abuse problems.  ‚ÄúI refused to do the wedding,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI pushed for the person to go into counseling.‚Äù  Some of the couples didn‚Äôt get married. A few did, and it was disaster.  IN LOVE WITH THE IDEA OF A WEDDING  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no such thing as a perfect couple,‚Äù Lentz said. ‚ÄúBut there are obvious warning signs, and too often people ignore them. When there is physical, substance and other forms of abuse, you can‚Äôt go through with the with wedding.‚Äù  Steve‚Äôs daughter was already sharing an apartment with her supposed husband-to-be. They were splitting the rent. She convinced him to move out, and now she pays the rent. The temptation would be to get married anyway, or at least keep living together.  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt marry someone unless you can trust them,‚Äù said Bishop Roger Gries. ‚ÄúSo many times, I‚Äôve sat through sessions with a couple where one person believes, ‚ÄòI can change him.‚Äô Or the person thinks, ‚ÄòAfter we get married, she‚Äôll change.‚Äô People do that more often than you‚Äôd think.‚Äù  If a couple is fighting with each other and their families about nearly every detail of the wedding, that‚Äôs also a piercing warning siren.  ‚ÄúThey have these destination weddings,‚Äù said Gries. ‚ÄúI was asked to do a wedding on a Florida beach. I refused. Most of the family couldn‚Äôt afford to attend. The wedding should be about a man and woman coming together, growing together, helping each other. Start praying with each other before you‚Äôre married ‚Äì and then keep praying. God needs to be in the center of it.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt be in love with all the trappings and fantasies involved in the wedding. You can spend months, even a year, planning it ‚Äì and it‚Äôs over almost faster than you say, ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù  Gries has been a priest for 60 years. He says people can‚Äôt worry about how it looks or what others will think if they realize they need to back out of the marriage.  The big point of this story: It‚Äôs not the wedding that‚Äôs life-changing, it‚Äôs the marriage.  READERS: As I was writing this column, I was stunned by the cost of a wedding. Can you tell me what you‚Äôve paid for your own or for someone in your family? How about destination weddings? I‚Äôll use some of your feedback for my next column.

"wedding","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","{""Columbia"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-20T17:19:00","COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) - Aric Hutchinson wishes he could remember the crash, but he said he does remember his bride‚Äôs last words to him before the golf cart carrying them along a South Carolina beach road from their wedding reception was hit by a car driven by a woman who authorities say was drunk.  ‚ÄúThe last thing I remember her saying was she wanted the night to never end,‚Äù he said in an interview broadcast Friday by ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúGood Morning America.‚Äù  The bride, Samantha Miller, 34, was killed in the April 28 crash and Hutchinson and two other passengers were injured. A toxicology report showed the driver of the car, Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, had a blood alcohol level of 0.261 ‚Äî over three times the legal limit. She is charged with reckless vehicular homicide and three counts of driving under the influence causing death or great bodily injury. Komoroski is currently being held without bond at a local jail, according to Charleston County Sheriff‚Äôs Office online records.  In a statement, Komoroski‚Äôs defense attorneys, Chris Gramiccioni, Deb Gramiccioni and Nathan Williams, asked the public not to rush to judgment.  ‚ÄúOur court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light,‚Äù they said.  Hutchinson said he remembers waking up in the hospital and knowing something was wrong when he saw his mother‚Äôs face.  ‚ÄúI asked her, ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs Sam? Where‚Äôs Sam?‚Äô and that‚Äôs when she told me there was an incident and that Sam didn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù he recalled.  Hutchinson remembers Miller‚Äôs calmness on their wedding night despite all the stresses of wedding planning. Family and friends came from all over the country and everyone, including Miller, was so happy.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around it, that night, going from an all-time high to an all-time low,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty rough to try to comprehend.‚Äù  Being back at the home he and Miller shared is hard, ‚Äúbut also nice,‚Äù Hutchinson said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got Sam written all over the house,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs nice to be here and have good memories.‚Äù  Hutchinson said he doesn‚Äôt have anything to say to Komoroski at this time.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.‚Äù  In addition to the criminal case, Komoroski faces a wrongful death lawsuit alongside several businesses accused of overserving her on the night of the crash.  Four bars gave ‚Äúcopious amounts of alcohol‚Äù to a ‚Äúvisibly intoxicated‚Äù woman ‚Äî Komoroski ‚Äî last month before she drove 40 mph (64 kph) over the speed limit into a golf cart carrying the couple away from their wedding reception, according to a new lawsuit filed Wednesday by Hutchinson and his relatives.  A taqueria that had recently hired Komoroski is accused of negligence and recklessness. An unnamed Taco Boy supervisor coerced the new server into consuming ‚Äúa dangerous amount of alcohol‚Äù at an employee function before the crash, according to the complaint.  In a statement on its website, Taco Boy denied that an ‚Äúofficially organized employee function around drinking‚Äù occurred. The statement said video footage, staff interviews and sales receipts confirm that Komoroski, who has since been fired, did not enter the restaurant on the day of the accident.

Sin√©ad O'Leary and Brian McGrenaghan at Muckross Abbey  And it was during a summer stroll, back in the bride's home town, that they got engaged, four years later, on the shores of Lough Leane. ‚ÄúIt was a beautiful warm sunny day and we took a walk with our daughter Lyla-Rose, who was almost two at the time, and our son Jack, who was only eight weeks old,‚Äù says Sin√©ad. ‚ÄúBrian had the ring box tucked away under his jumper and when I was admiring the view he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.‚Äù  Sin√©ad O'Leary and Brian McGrenaghan with their wedding party  That June proposal led to a November wedding, three years later, as they exchanged vows a little further along the road, in the Muckross Park Hotel & Spa, holding their reception in the same five-star venue.  Killarney National Park created the picture-perfect on their big day, which was precisely what the couple wanted, as they could pay tribute to the bride's father, the late Paudie O'Leary, in a special way.

A bride who took her wedding caterer to the Disputes Tribunal said she received platters two hours late, was left with just one scantily-clad waitress serving 100 people and ‚Äúcountless excuses‚Äù.  The caterer, Tina Rae, feels she's been unfairly criticised online but is getting out of the wedding business for good.  Her business has 20 one-star reviews accusing her of cancelling events at the last minute, or providing sub-par platters.  Rae bought Fare Food Boutique Co, which provides catering services from a coffee cart, in October.  She was hired by the bride to provide food platters, some drinks, and bar services for her wedding on February 3 at a cost of $2000.  Supplied/Supplied Tina Rae's coffee cart at the wedding that ended up at the Disputes Tribunal.  After the wedding, bride Aleshia Scott posted a critical Google review and went to the Disputes Tribunal to seek a $1500 refund. She said Rae did not provide the services she paid for with reasonable care and skill.  The referee agreed and ordered Rae to pay before June 11. Rae said she was asking for a rehearing because repeated phone calls from the tribunal referee did not connect.  In a counterclaim, Rae sought $3500 for stress and derogatory comments she alleged caused her to lose work. The referee dismissed Rae‚Äôs claim because the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear it.  In her decision, the referee said she tried to call Rae‚Äôs cellphone number seven times over 35 minutes to connect her to the hearing, but Rae did not answer. The absence of one party does not prevent a hearing going ahead.  The referee said she accepted Scott‚Äôs ‚Äústraightforward and plausible‚Äù evidence.  Supplied/Supplied Scott‚Äôs bridesmaid, sister-in-law and celebrant having to work the bar.  Scott told the hearing she arranged for Rae to bring out platters for her guests at 4pm, but they didn't arrive until nearly 6pm, when the guests were about to start their main meal.  She had paid for three bar staff for six hours, but just one staff member was on site for several hours and they did not seem competent, resulting in her family feeling they needed to step in and serve drinks themselves, she said.  ‚ÄúI actually just had to try my hardest to ignore it, everyone told me not to worry but my bridesmaid, sister-in-law and celebrant had to work the bar,‚Äù Scott told Stuff.  Scott said she had put everything in writing for Rae so that the day would run as smoothly as possible and there would be no room for faults.  Glassware was not cleared away from tables as promised, and drink dispensers, barista-made coffee, tea, ice, lawn games, a dessert platter, a candy station and a generator were not provided as arranged, the referee said.  She acknowledged Rae had ‚Äúresourcing and illness issues‚Äù, but said it was her responsibility to have backup plans to deliver what she promised.  Scott‚Äôs Google review included issues with the way Rae‚Äôs staff were dressed, and Rae leaving with her daughter for two hours without telling anyone.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already a stressful day to begin with and to have my grandparents come up and ask me why that girl was dressed like that, it was embarrassing,‚Äù Scott told Stuff.  ‚ÄúOne of the young girls was wearing short shorts, a crop top and a crop top/bar and were all rude to the guests, we had many complain to us about their attire and their attitudes,‚Äù she wrote in the review.  Rae told Stuff she answered the referee‚Äôs calls but couldn‚Äôt hear anything, so asked for a rehearing.  Rae said, and put in a statement to the tribunal, that the wedding did not go as planned because two staff were sick with Covid and her daughter, who was one of the backup wait staff, started to feel very unwell in the extreme heat that day and she had to take her to hospital. The person who did work was called in at the last minute and had no time to dress differently.  She alleged some of the wedding guests were drunk and rude to the worker.  Supplied Rae was to provide bar services for guests, but sickness meant she was short-staffed. (File photo)  Rae told Stuff she agreed to stay two hours later to make up for the time she spent taking her daughter to hospital and was unable to do a hen party also booked for that night.  ‚ÄúLots of different things went wrong. It‚Äôs not an excuse, it‚Äôs just what happened. It‚Äôs been an absolute palaver. I will never do any other wedding ever, not even for friends.‚Äù  While she gave the hen party a full refund, she said the guests all went online to give her one-star reviews, which, along with Scott‚Äôs Google review, prompted another upcoming bride to cancel. The contract meant she was not entitled to get her non-refundable deposit back, Rae said.  That bride, Monique Sara, told Stuff she cancelled because she lost faith in Rae‚Äôs ability to provide the service she expected. She said she booked Rae based on photographs she saw of the platters online, which were taken before Rae bought the business.  ‚ÄúIt looked incredible but by the looks of things it was an old owner,‚Äù Sara said.  UNSPLASH Rae failed to provide platters for a 70th wedding anniversary at short notice but did pay a refund. (File photo)  Amanda Rait said she paid Rae $375* for two platters for her grandparents 70th wedding anniversary in January. However, Rae cancelled three-and-a-half hours before the event, which caused stress and disappointment. She received a full refund eventually, she said.  Rae said she had to cancel that event because she was assaulted the night before by people trying to steal her carts. She had two coffee carts previously and an ice cream cart that she bought and resold. She now hoped to sell the Fare Food Boutique Co cart and buy a smaller one to continue a smaller-scale coffee business.  Rae said the bad reviews had prompted rude messages and comments all over social media ‚Äì ‚Äúso much so we have ceased all business‚Äù.  ‚ÄúSo currently there is no way of being able to pay anyone due to the online harassment and dressing down,‚Äù she said.  *A previous version of this story incorrectly said Amanda Rait paid $750 when she paid $375.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L2J1c2luZXNzLzEzMjA4MTU5MS9jYXRlcmVyLW9yZGVyZWQtdG8tcmVmdW5kLWJyaWRlLTE1MDAtc2F5cy1zaGVsbC1uZXZlci1kby1hLXdlZGRpbmctYWdhaW7SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

At the rate the players are going this off-season, the team may need to consider hiring a wedding planner.  We already know that Sens captain Brady Tkachuk is getting married this summer to his partner, Emma Farinacci.  And now, in the past month alone, at least three other members of the Ottawa Senators have bent the knee to propose to their longtime girlfriends, all taking to Instagram to announce their big news to the world. In each case, their happy hockey teammates, past and present, jammed their replies with congratulatory messages.  Sens defenceman Thomas Chabot took a knee on a beautiful beach in Anguilla this week to propose to his longtime partner, Marion Pandreau.  Sens centre Jake Lucchini, who played 11 games for the Senators this season, also proposed this week to his girlfriend, Abbie Botz, back home in Madison, Wisconsin.

Needham House Hotel in the village of Little Wymondley, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, shut its doors earlier this month after the Home Office booked the property out completely for a year.  Jade Kolonics and her fiance Danny Neal were due to get married at the venue on August 25 and the couple were putting the finishing touches on their preparations.  Ms Kolonics said: 'Our invites have been sent and RSVP'd to, guests have booked hotel rooms - we have family coming down from all over - and now, only 15 weeks away from the big day, we have no venue, no food and no hotel rooms.  'I am beyond stressed and it has had a massive impact on my mental health.'  Jade Kolonics and her fiance Danny Neal were due to get married at the venue on August 25 and the couple were putting the finishing touches on their preparations  Nicola Harmel was supposed to be tying the knot at the hotel next summer but now wants to find another venue  Needham House Hotel in the village of Little Wymondley, near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, shut its doors earlier this month after the Home Office booked the property out completely for a year  Nicola Harmel was supposed to be tying the knot at the hotel next summer but now wants to find another venue.  She is demanding a refund by Needham House but bosses say they can still hold the ceremony as the hotel should be free by then.  Ms Harmel fumed: 'We have our wedding booked next August and no refunds can be made because they have the government contract for one year.  'Needham House said the wedding will go ahead. However, the Novotel in Stevenage had a one-year government contract and it's now one and a half years and they still haven't opened the doors to the public.  'I cannot risk having three months to go for them to say they are extending the contract. We need the money from the deposit to put on another location.'  HAVE YOU BEEN AFFECTED BY THE CLOSURE? Email: tom.pyman@mailonline.co.uk  Meanwhile, customer Lewis Male said: 'My partner and I are due to get married in July and had over 25 rooms booked at this venue for our wedding for family and friends travelling up from Somerset.  'We are devastated and not sure what to do at all.'  Rob Close has his wedding booked at Needham House in 2024 but was given a nasty shock when he saw the state of the hotel after driving there recently to seek assurances his big day could still go ahead.  The Needham House Hotel (pictured) closed up earlier this month after the Home Office booked it out in its entirety for 230 migrants  The hotel (pictured inside), whose website is no longer in use, has cancelled 11 weddings and two proms since it was forced to shut up shop  He jumped in his car after getting no answer on the phone and said: 'I found the hotel starting to be stripped down, furniture moved out the way and being organised into different areas.  'We had a meeting at the venue on May 4 to discuss upgrades to our package, booking further rooms, and layouts, with no inclination of anything like this happening.  'I have heard deposits paid for 2024 will not be refunded as this contract is only for a year and Needham House could still honour these bookings, despite no way of telling what condition the facilities and rooms will be in.  'We are devastated as it the perfect venue for us but we are yet to have even heard from them.'  Miss Kolonics is expecting a refund of several thousand pounds for the disruption and has luckily now found a new venue for her big day at Knebworth Barns.  She said: 'I don't know who is to blame - is it the Government for taking over the hotel or is it Needham House Hotel for accepting it?  'But it isn't great to be told that you can't have your wedding there at such short notice when we've paid thousands of pounds and had much of the preparation work done.  'The Hotel have offered us a full refund - although they are not giving us any kind of compensation. They have also helped find another venue.  'It's been really tough but I'm of a more positive outlook now and in a better frame of mind.'

"wedding","2023-05-13","15:00:00","Not Discerned","2023-05-19T16:51:51","We‚Äôve made it to the end of Wediquette Week and our final question packs a punch. This week we‚Äôve talked about the cost of wedding gifts, plus ones and fashion. Read all four installments here. But today‚Äôs question is a two-parter that involves firing someone, essentially.  Question: A) Can I disinvite someone from a guest list? B) Also, related, can I fire a bridal party member?  Answer A: As a rule, disinviting a guest is one of the biggest ‚Äòdon‚Äôts‚Äô when it comes to weddings. This is why it‚Äôs so important to think long and hard about your guest list in the first place. If budget is a concern, create an A and a B list. Work from the A list first, then if spaces come available, begin adding from the B list. Meanwhile, life happens and people have fall outs. If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs better to power through than to disinvite. There a few reasons for this: 1) No matter how upset the other party made you, disinviting them could create an unmendable rift. 2) Disinviting them could cause even more drama. 3) They might decide not to come without you disinviting them, so let the chips fall where they may, and it might work itself out. It could be beneficial to simply have a mature conversation (preferably in person or on the phone, but not via text or email unless it‚Äôs unavoidable, because you want the benefit of facial cues and body language) with the other party about what‚Äôs going on between the two of you. This could lead to mending the problem, a truce for the day of the wedding or, again, them deciding to sit this one out. If there are concerns over a person‚Äôs potential behavior at the wedding, this is also a good time to (maturely) address the situation.  Answer B: Any way you slice it, it can be tricky to fire an attendant. Also, there are a lot of reasons why you might want to and, since we don‚Äôt know the situation, here‚Äôs a general answer. It‚Äôs best to be direct and have a heart-to-heart. Again, this should happen in person or on the phone, but not via text or email unless it‚Äôs unavoidable, because you want the benefit of facial cues and body language. Approach he conversation with as much kindness and gentle grace as possible. A sample script is:  Get permission (this goes a long way): ‚ÄòCan we talk about the wedding?‚Äô  Indicate why you wanted them in your wedding in the first place: ‚ÄòI love you and you are one of my best friends, so naturally I want you to be a part of this wedding.‚Äô  Broach the problem: ‚ÄòBut, it seems as though [insert problem here using feeling statements].‚Äô (This could be anything from ‚Äòit seems as though life is really hectic and it‚Äôs hard to participate in a lot of the wedding activities,‚Äô to ‚ÄòI‚Äôve noticed tension between you and my sister‚Äô or whatever)  Say how this makes you feel: ‚ÄòI feel disappointed when I get an R.S.V.P. of yes and you‚Äôre absent, because I want to celebrate this time with you,‚Äô or ‚Äòit‚Äôs upsetting to me when I see you and my sister arguing.‚Äô Again, stick with whatever it is you feel when the problem occurs.  Give them an escape hatch: If you are having a hard time with [insert some aspect of the duties and commitments or clashing with the other attendants] I‚Äôm thinking it might ease the situation if you were to bow out of attendant duties.  Invite them to speak: ‚ÄòWhat do you think?‚Äô  Listen with an open heart and mind to what they have to say and be gentle, but direct with your responses. Be clear about your expectations. Give them an opportunity to respond. They may feel attacked, so let them vent and try not to get worked up in response. Most of all, be considerate and maybe also bring an offering of chocolate. Everything is better with chocolate.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bmV3b3JsZWFucy5jb20vd2VkaXF1ZXR0ZS13ZWVrLWNhbi15b3UtZGlzaW52aXRlLWEtZ3Vlc3Qtb3ItbWVtYmVyLW9mLXRoZS1icmlkYWwtcGFydHkv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Imaginechina  A group wedding for local young talent was held on the Huangpu River waterfront in Yangpu District on Friday to mark the so-called ""Internet Valentine's Day"" in China.  Eight couples, including university teachers, doctors and high-tech professionals working in the district, made vows under the witness of over 100 guests and received wedding certificates from government officials including Jiang Rui, head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau.

"wedding","2023-05-19","Not Discerned","{""SaintPaul"", ""Minnesota"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T16:51:15","Murder, mystery and romance have been in the air lately with a swathe of new Hallmark movie releases hitting the 2023 TV schedule . Though the channel is trying out some new titles like Curious Caterer, it‚Äôs also bringing back some major fan favorites. Among them is the latest installment in the Hannah Swensen Mysteries series (formerly Murder, She Baked). I was lucky enough to hear from Alison Sweeney about the latest installment Carrot Cake Murder. Ahead of the film‚Äôs release we talked weddings, ‚Äúprop‚Äù desserts, one reader-favorite cat and more.  As fans already know, Hannah (Sweeney) and her partner in crime solving Mike (Cameron Mathison) have been engaged for a while ‚Äì even during the course of events of the last franchise flick, Sweet Revenge. When I asked Ms. Sweeney about whether a wedding was imminent in her follow-up to the second Wedding Veil trilogy, she brought up what we know from Joanne Fluke‚Äôs books, but also joked about a body near a wedding cake.  Since Hannah hasn‚Äôt gotten married for real in the books, (except one time to a con artist that ended up being annulled lol), I can only imagine what her wedding would be like! I mean‚Ä¶ would she find a dead body underneath the cake?!  Speaking of cake, I‚Äôve always wondered how the cast manages to film all those dessert scenes without it impacting their waistlines, and Ms. Sweeney let us in on a bit of a secret: ‚Äúprop desserts.‚Äù Though there seems to be some eating involved, as the actress told CinemaBlend she often chooses which Joanne Fluke book she‚Äôd like to try next based on the recipes included in the books, keeping those sweets in check is part of the movie-making magic.  Yes - I often narrow down the books to consider what‚Äôs next based on the delicious titles. So many yummy recipes to choose from, and then lots of 'prop' desserts to avoid eating too much of [them]!  I guess one really can have their (carrot) cake and eat it too.  Sweeney and co. acquired the rights to the Fluke books ahead of the last film in the series, which led to the name change from Murder, She Baked to Hannah Swensen Mysteries. Despite some BTS complications related to the changes, the franchise is still going strong and Hallmark announced this week another one will be released in the coming months. The next film, A Zest for Death: A Hannah Swensen Mystery, will be based on the Joanne Fluke novel Lemon Meringue.  It's great news for the fans, as we have seen some murder mysteries canceled at Hallmark in recent months. There's so much more for the franchise to explore regarding Hannah's growth in mystery-solving as well as in her personal life, so I'm happy the movies were able to continue.  Sweeney previously told TV Insider the couple is ‚Äúnot very far into planning the wedding,‚Äù when the new movie picks up, so fans will likely be waiting for another Swensen sequel before they can get excited for a body at a wedding or -- let's be honest about what we're most excited about -- Hannah's choice of a dress.

The anniversary post comes just days after the 'How I Met Your Father' actress revealed that she follows a fasting diet in an effort to keep her slim figure as she explained that she she gets up ‚Äúreally hungry‚Äù but sustains herself with coffee.

And nothing makes or breaks a look quite like your choice of shoe. Your footwear has to complement your look while remaining relevant to the location and dress code, plus be comfortable enough to dance in until the wee hours of the morning.  We tapped a couple of experts for professional guidance on the matter. Stylist James Bianca believes the ideal wedding sandal is one that marries both beauty and comfort. Shawna Ferguson, a stylist and costume designer, said your choice of footwear should ‚Äúbe a cut above your go-to sandals that you throw on for brunch or to run errands, but should not be so eye-catching as to distract from the real focus of the event.‚Äù  Advertisement  While both of our experts shared that either flat or heel sandals are completely appropriate for casual or semi-formal weddings, Bianca personally prefers heels over flats for their ability to elongate the leg and elevate your overall wedding guest look. That said, they both strongly cautioned against stiletto heels ‚Äî block, wedge or platform heels are definitely the way to go. Bianca also recommended finding a shoe that can be securely strapped into place, further stabilizing your foot so you can dance the night away safely and comfortably.  Ferguson mentioned that neutrals and natural-fiber designs work beautifully for more casual daytime weddings while minimal strappy sandals can be dressed up for evening events. If you prefer a more eye-catching vibe, she said, ‚Äúsculptural heel details can be more playful than a standard platform.‚Äù  If you‚Äôre still at a loss, Bianca pointed out that you can always just go with a metallic. ‚ÄúGold and silver can act as neutral and gives you more value because you can style it with other looks throughout wedding season and beyond.‚Äù  Below, we rounded up a selection of wedding guest sandals per our experts‚Äô recommendations. They come in a wide variety of styles so you can be sure to find the one that best fits your personal aesthetic and be able to enjoy them time and time again. Best of all, each of these beauties is under $200, so you don‚Äôt have to worry about yet another crushing wedding season investment.

""Damn, he finally did it! He got married I never would've thought! They are so cute together,"" one fan wrote. Another added, ""Awwww congratulations!!""  Oppenheim set the record straight in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE: ""Lou and I quickly realized that our post on Instagram made it look like we had just been married.

""The truth is, we both knew from the beginning that I would have to move back because of my job, friends, and family being here,"" she wrote in response to a fan question on social media.

An example of this is OnlyFans. The app, which was created with the aim of having celebrities share exclusive content with fans who paid a subscription, went awry along the way and has ended up being a space where users of this platform publish explicit videos and fulfil the desires of their followers who pay a certain amount of money for them.  But the business doesn't always go smoothly, as in the case of Taila, a 28-year-old OnlyFans model who has shared her bizarre experience on the app.  Taila Maddison posa en sus redes sociales. Instagram  Stepfather is number one subscriber on OnlyFans: He's seen videos of me touching myself  Tailaha explained that thanks to the content she has published on OnlyFans she manages to earn more than 6,000 dollars from her subscribers, but it has not all been good news for the young woman, as she has discovered that one of her biggest followers is her mother's boyfriend.  ""I ruined my mom's marriage, I never planned telling this story on TikTok, but here we are,"" she said on TikTok.  ""So when I first started my website, I had this customer who was my number one customer, bought every single thing that I sent him, he was pretty much a follower since the beginning.  ""We would talk every day, he made custom requests, very specific things, and he also had a very specific user name on the website.""  According to Taila, the man had spent 500 dollars on her profile to see much more explicit content of the young woman and both had shared racy photographs.  Taila Maddison posa en sus redes sociales.

""When I caught him, he denied it to all of his friends, and obviously my mom got rid of him straight away.  Taila Maddison posa en sus redes sociales.

And with catering costs usually increasing with the more guests you invite, it can be frustrating if you have people that RSVP to your wedding and then don't show up.  To combat this problem, one bride has taken some extreme measures - as she's threatening to take her wedding guests to court if they RSVP to her special day and then don't show up.  The bride said her family can be ""flaky"" at times so she can't trust them to actually turn up even if they say they will, so she wants to make sure she can recoup the costs of catering and services if they decide not to come.  Image: Getty Images) Getty Images)  In a post on Facebook which was later shared to Reddit, she wrote: ""I love my family dearly but sometimes they are flaky. I'm getting married in October of 2024 and when I send out invitations, I want to put on the invitation that if they RSVP and don't come, I'm taking them to court for the cost of their portion of the food and services I paid for.  ""Is that tacky? Obviously, there's no cost to them if they RSVP and actually come.""  Commenters on the Reddit post were baffled by the bride's idea though, as many of them said her claims likely wouldn't stand up in court because RSVPing to an event isn't a legally binding contract.  One person explained: ""She would have to file each claim individually in small claims court. Each individual claim would get thrown out because there is literally nothing in contract law in any universe that would say an RSVP is a contract. And if any one of the defendants had given her a gift that would likely count as fulfilling their side of the bargain anyway.""  While another said: ""How can you be so clueless that you don't realise this is tacky?""  And a third posted: ""Step one on how to ensure there are zero guests attending your wedding.""  Meanwhile, another commenter said they could understand the bride's frustration after they had a family of six people RSVP to their wedding and not show up, which cost them around ¬£800. However, despite the incident leaving them ""upset"", they still wouldn't dream of taking the family to court.  They wrote: ""I had a family of six RSVP and not show up. Didn't have a great excuse either, just didn't want to come. We had a weekend of stuff going on so it cost me about $1,000 (¬£800). I'm obviously upset, but court? No.""  Do you have a story to sell?

In fact, the wedding stress in some extreme situations can end up impacting the couple and the associated families to such an extent that it winds up taking a toll on their health. And as the wedding date approaches, the worry just continues to mount and robs you of the actual wedding enjoyment. According to a survey by Zola (Wedding Registry Firm), 96% of couples acknowledged that planning a wedding is difficult, with over half of them describing their sentiments as ""very stressful"" or ""extremely stressful.""Hiring a wedding planner is the best move to make if you want to focus fully on your ""happily ever after"" and escape the burden and worry of wedding planning . Doing so will allow you to make the most of your wedding while leaving all the work to the planner. In fact, the planner will utilize your vision to make your dream wedding a reality. Since they will play a key role on one of the most important days of your life, finding a wedding planner who is knowledgeable, experienced, and shares your and your partner's vision is unquestionably vital.Although the market is flooded with wedding planners that does not necessarily mean that each option is a good fit for you. Check out their website and portfolio as a starting point to look over their past works in order to determine if they match your taste. Also, do not miss to look up their social media to get a hint of their aesthetics and style.Once that you have shortlisted a list of planners the next step involves meeting them in-person. Their work might look very enticing on their website or social media but does it appear to connect with your ideas and vision? Planning a couple of initial sessions with the planner will allow you to determine whether you and the planner are on the same page and if they would be a valuable addition to your wedding. Also, make sure to examine whether the planner understands your and your partner's needs and can turn your ideal wedding into a reality.Finding someone you actually enjoy working with is crucial because you will be in daily contact with your wedding coordinator until the big day. If you cannot discover common ground with a wedding planner despite their incredibly attractive portfolio, it is best to search elsewhere. Given that your planner will become a part of your family, it is essential to ensure that his sensibilities align with yours in every way to prevent any future conflicts.Going through the wedding planner's earlier work will not only give you ideas and inspiration for your own event, but it will also enable you to determine whether or not their style corresponds to your own. In addition, it will also provide you a sneak peek into their creativity and innovation. For your dream wedding to become a reality, it is crucial for your planner to understand your ideas and vision and have the imagination necessary to make them come true.Transparent communication between you and your wedding planner is the foundation of a dream wedding. The planner should be proactive and maintain frequent communication with you to keep you updated on the preparations and reduce your stress. As a result, it is recommended that you establish a mutual means of communication with your wedding planner as soon as you finalize one.A wedding planner who is not current on the latest wedding trends and fads won't be able to make your ideal wedding come true. Knowledge applies to all aspects of wedding planning, from selecting a seasoned venue to interior design and theme. In fact, given that weddings are a huge affair, unannounced problems are bound to take place. And when the entire plan falls apart, it all depends on the wedding planner's capabilities to come up with a constructive alternative.Weddings are mostly a once-in-a-lifetime thing. Embracing those moments of their lives, a couple wants everything to be perfect on their wedding day. In order to set aside all your wedding worries and make the most of the day, it is imperative for the wedding couple to hire a wedding planner.

The royal duo has become one of the most talked-about couples ever since rumors began circulating that they were dating. Fast forward to now, and they are happily married parents of two, celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary. While their romance was a whirlwind, the two have proven that they are meant to be!  As they quietly ring in five years of marriage amid turmoil surrounding their recent encounter with the paparazzi, let's look back at Harry and Meghan's romance for the ages.  July 2016: They Meet  The couple met in early July after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend believed to Violet von Westenholz, according to Katie Nicholl's book Harry: Life, Loss and Love. Von Westenholz's father is a friend of Prince Charles, which explains the Harry connection, and works for Ralph Lauren, which is how she met Meghan.  In their adorable engagement interview, Harry spoke fondly of their first meeting. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her [for the first time],""he shared. ""I was like, 'Wow, OK. I'm going to have to up my game here. I'm going to sit down and make sure I got a good chat.'""  Their second date immediately followed, the two meeting at Soho House London.  August 2016: Botswana Under the Stars  After those two dates in London, Harry was clearly smitten and invited Meghan to join him in Botswana, before he jetted to an AIDS conference in South Africa. She accepted the invitation.  ""I think about three, maybe four weeks later [after we met], I managed to persuade her to come join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,"" Harry gushed in their engagement interview. ""We spent five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure we had a chance to get to know each other.""  Harry would later source the main diamond of Meghan's engagement ring from the African country because it plays such a special role in their relationship. But we're getting ahead of ourselves...  November 2016: Prince Harry Releases a Telling Statement  After several rumors surrounding the Suits star and the red-headed royal led to Meghan being followed and harassed once she was back in Toronto to shoot the USA show, Harry took matters into his own hands. In a rare move, Harry released an official statement from Kensington Palace, both referring to Meghan as his ""girlfriend"" and condemning those harassing her.  ""It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm,"" the statement read. ""He knows commentators will say this is 'the price she has to pay' and that 'this is all part of the game.' He strongly disagrees. This is not a game -- it is her life and his.""  The telling moment of chivalry marked a new stage in Harry‚Äôs dating life, as Meghan became the first of Harry's girlfriends to be so publicly acknowledged.  Andrew Milligan - WPA Pool/Getty Images  September 2017: Meghan Declares Her Love  Meghan made a big statement of her own in the October issue of Vanity Fair. The actress spoke about her romance with Harry for the first time.  ""I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it's really simple. We're two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news,"" she told the magazine. ""And I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people's perception. Nothing about me changed. I'm still the same person that I am, and I've never defined myself by my relationship.""  November 2017: Engagement Confirmation!  After filming wrapped on Meghan‚Äôs final season of Suits, she was spotted moving across the pond days before her engagement news broke.

""Archie is enjoying, albeit a privileged lifestyle, a remarkably ordinary lifestyle. There hasn't been a team of maternity nurses and night nurses and staff on call to cater for their every whim,"" royal expert Katie Nicholl told ET in July, the same month that Archie's christening took place.  October 2019: A Royal Lawsuit  Harry and Meghan took a major step to protect their privacy when they pursued legal action against Associated Newspapers -- owners of the Daily Mail, MailOnline, Metro and more -- after the Mail on Sunday published a private, handwritten letter that Meghan wrote to her estranged father.  ""Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one. Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself,"" Harry said in a statement, alluding to his mother, Princess Diana's, death. ""I‚Äôve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces. We thank you, the public, for your continued support. It is hugely appreciated. Although it may not seem like it, we really need it.""  Harry and Meghan officially won the case in February 2021.

""So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed, I guess thank you for asking, because not many people have asked if I am OK. But it‚Äôs a very real thing to be going through behind-the-scenes.""  The reporter went on to ask if it'd be ""fair to say that [it's] not really OK and it's really been a struggle?"" and Meghan quickly replied, ""Yes.""  January to April 2020: A Step Back From the Royal Family  After spending the holidays away from the royal family, Harry and Meghan made the shocking announcement that they were taking a step back as senior members of the royal family.  In their statement, the couple said they would work to become financially independent and split their time between the United Kingdom and North America.  ""The queen is devastated by the decision, although she had been aware of their struggle the last few months and has been concerned for their well-being and happiness. Many family members were very disappointed with the Sussexes,"" a source told ET shortly thereafter, noting that some members of the royal family have called the move ""selfish.""  A royal family meeting soon followed, and eventually the couple reached a resolution that involved them losing their HRH titles and stripping Harry of his military appointments. Later, the Harry and Meghan were told that they could not keep the name of their charitable foundation as ""Sussex Royal"" due to their exit.  Before making things official, the couple went on one last U.K. tour, which culminated in a Commonwealth Day event. While they initially settled in Canada, in March, the couple made the move to Los Angeles. Harry and Meghan officially closed their royal office on April 1.  Summer 2020: Life in Los Angeles  Amid quarantine, the couple gave back and got involved in the Black Lives Matter movement.  ""They are busy and they are doing quite a lot behind the scenes, but you know, this is a couple that tends to operate 100 miles per hour. I think they're enjoying the lockdown and the fact that they've been able to take a bit of a breather,"" royal expert Katie Nicholl told ET. ""It's been a very, very busy year for them, and I think this is a moment to just take a breath, reflect, and I think that's what they'll be doing on their anniversary.""  In July, the couple moved to an 18,000 square foot home in Montecito, California, which they purchased for $14.9 million. Two months later, the couple officially became financially independent from the royal family.  November 2020: Meghan Reveals She Suffered a Miscarriage  In an op-ed for The New York Times, Meghan revealed that she suffered a miscarriage a few months prior.  ""After changing [Archie's] diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right,"" she wrote. ""I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.""  ""Hours later, I lay in a hospital bed, holding my husband‚Äôs hand. I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears,"" Meghan continued. ""Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we'd heal.""  February 2021: Baby No. 2  On Valentine's Day, Harry and Meghan announced that they were ""overjoyed"" to be expecting their second child.  Shortly after they announced that their family is growing, a palace spokesman told ET, ""Her Majesty, [the] Duke of Edinburgh, [the] Prince of Wales and the entire family are delighted and wish them well,"" referring to Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Prince Charles.  March 2021: The Oprah Sit-Down  In the wake of Harry and Meghan's baby news, and around the same time the couple made their royal exit permanent, CBS announced that the duo would sit down for a tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey.  When the interview aired, there were no shortage of bombshells. Among the biggest reveals were the fact that Harry and Meghan secretly got married before their royal wedding; that one member of the royal family expressed concern over what color Archie's skin would be; that Meghan was suicidal during her first pregnancy; that Harry's relationships with Prince Charles and Prince William remained strained.  Afterwards, Buckingham Palace reacted to the interview.  ""The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan,"" the Palace said in a statement. ""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning.""  ""While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately,"" the statement continued. ""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members.""  While Harry did speak to his father and brother after the interview aired, they were ""not productive"" conversations, according to Gayle King.  June 2021: Meghan Gives Birth  The couple welcomed their second child, and shared the joyous news in a statement.  ""It is with great joy that Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, welcome their daughter, Lilibet 'Lili' Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, to the world,"" the statement read. ""Lili was born on Friday, June 4 at 11:40 a.m. in the trusted care of the doctors and staff at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, CA. She weighed 7 lbs 11 oz.""  ""Both mother and child are healthy and well, and settling in at home. Lili is named after her great-grandmother, Her Majesty The Queen, whose family nickname is Lilibet. Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honor her beloved late grandmother, The Princess of Wales,"" the statement continued. ""This is the second child for the couple, who also have a two-year-old son named Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. The Duke and Duchess thank you for your warm wishes and prayers as they enjoy this special time as a family.""  Harry and Meghan added, ""On June 4th, we were blessed with the arrival of our daughter, Lili. She is more than we could have ever imagined, and we remain grateful for the love and prayers we‚Äôve felt from across the globe. Thank you for your continued kindness and support during this very special time for our family.""  July 2021: Prince Harry Announces Memoir  Penguin Random House announced that it would publish Harry's first memoir, a move that royal experts speculated would further the rift between Harry and his family.  ""I'm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become,"" Harry said in a statement. ""I've worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story -- the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned -- I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think.""  ""I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I've learned over the course of my life so far,"" he added, ""and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my life that's accurate and wholly truthful.""  In October 2022, Harry's memoir was revealed to be titled Spare, and the book was given a release date of Jan. 10. Additionally, it was announced that proceeds from the book will go to various charities including Sentebale and WellChild.  Netflix  December 2022: A Netflix Docuseries  Harry & Meghan, a six-episode docuseries, was announced and offered fans a rare peek inside the couple's life. As the first three episodes were released, the series' disclaimer said that members of the royal family declined to comment on the show, which the royals denied.  The episodes were full of new information about Harry and Meghan -- from Harry's secret Instagram account to Meghan's first meeting with William and Kate. Harry also compared his wife to his late mother, and the couple shared rare pics of their two kids.  After Harry and Meghan denied claims that the series was hypocritical, the last three episodes of the show were released. Those episodes detailed a yelling match between Harry and William, saw the couple speak about their devastating miscarriage, and showed Harry reflecting on his royal exit.  January 2023: 'Spare' Is Released  Harry held nothing back in his memoir, discussing everything from once taking mushrooms at Courteney Cox's house to dealing with his grandparents' death after his royal exit, to thinking of William as his ""archnemesis.""  Harry also wrote about his childhood trauma, his father's teddy bear, losing his virginity, his past relationships, his time in the military and his mental health.  Then there was the talk about Meghan, from how they met and fell in love, all the way to their royal family exit.  March 2023: Harry and Meghan Are Evicted  King Charles III told the couple to forego the home they kept in the U.K. since their 2018 wedding.  ""We can confirm the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage,"" a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan told ET.  Harry and Meghan have until early summer to vacate the property. It has not been confirmed who delivered the eviction notice, however, ET confirmed it was at the directive of the king.  ""Since Harry's book was released, relationships between Harry and Meghan and the family have never been worse. Charles is extremely disappointed in what was shared in the book,"" a source told ET. ""Harry was disrespectful to Camilla in the book and you can‚Äôt expect to act that way without consequences.""  On the heels of the news, the couple stepped out for the first time since Spare's release. According to pics obtained by Page Six, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex enjoyed a private dinner at San Vicente Bungalows in Los Angeles.  March 2023: Lilibet Has a Private Christening  The couple chose to christen their youngest child in a private ceremony at their Montecito, California, home. According to People, the ceremony had between 20 and 30 guests, which included Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, Lilibet's godfather, Tyler Perry, and an unnamed godmother. Despite issuing invitations to King Charles III, Camila, Queen Consort, Prince William and Kate Middleton, no royals attended the event.  Though the royals did not attend the christening, Lilibet and Archie later received official royal titles of ""prince"" and ""princess"" on the royal website that same month.  Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images  April 2023: Harry and Meghan Let Loose  Harry and Meghan enjoyed a parents' night out at the L.A. Lakers vs. the Memphis Grizzlies game, where they were spotted on the Crypto.com Arena's Jumbotron.  An eyewitness at the game told ET that the crowd was cheering loudly for the couple, in a very positive way, when they appeared on the Jumbotron.  ""They giggled when they realized they were on the big screen. They seemed really happy and were having a lot of fun,"" the eyewitness added.  May 2023: Harry Attends King Charles III's Coronation Without Meghan  As was previously announced, the Duke of Sussex attended his father's coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, May 6, without his wife by his side. Harry was only in London for just over 24 hours for the historic event. Meanwhile, Meghan stayed behind to celebrate their son, Archie's, fourth birthday.  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images Ms. Foundation for Women  May 2023: A Public Event Turns Terrifying  The couple stepped out at the Ms. Foundation Women of Vision Awards in New York City with Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland. They were all smiles with Meghan in a gold gown to receive an award at the event. But as they were leaving the occasion, things took a turn for the family.  ""Last night, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi,"" their spokesperson said in a statement to ET.  ""This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians and two NYPD officers,"" the statement continued. ""While being a public figure comes with a level of interest from the public, it should never come at the cost of anyone‚Äôs safety. Dissemination of these images, given the ways in which they were obtained, encourages a highly intrusive practice that is dangerous to all in involved.""  The New York Police Department's Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Julian Phillips also issued a statement to ET in response to the incident, saying officers ""assisted the private security team protecting the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. There were numerous photographers that made their transport challenging. The Duke and Duchess arrived at their destination and there were no reported collisions, summonses, injuries or arrested in regard.""  Backgrid USA photo agency claimed in a statement to ET that the ""freelance contributors... were covering the couple's stay in New York City, including the possibility of a dinner after an award ceremony."" The company alleged that the photographers ""had no intention of causing any distress or harm, as their only tool was their cameras.""

There is always a ceremony that is considered the ‚Äúwedding of the year‚Äù and, in 2023, it was the turn of Sofia Richie and Elliot Grainge‚Äòs union. The weekend festivities took place at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, south of France, and included guests such as Cameron Diaz, Benji Madden, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie, and Joel Madden.  The model and designer shared everything on her social media. She wore a trio of dresses created by Chanel for her rehearsal dinner, wedding ceremony and after-party. As Richie walked down the aisle with her dad, Stephen Sanchez was singing her favorite song: ‚ÄúUntil I Found You‚Äù.  Even though Sofia¬¥s wedding was iconic, there are many other cerimonies that were remarkable as well. So, here is more model‚Äôs weddings to die for.  Kate Moss  The supermodel Kate Moss got married to Jamie Hince, in 2011, in Costwold Village, England. Inspired by rock‚Äôn roll and Great Gatsby the party that lasted three days was full of A-list celebrities and fashion designers. Some of the guests were Naomi Campbel, Stella and Paul McCartney, Jude Law, Vivienne Westwood, Christian Louboutin and Marc Jacobs. Kate Moss wore a retro chic dress design by her friend and designer John Galiano.  Hailey Bieber  Hailey Bieber and Justin Bieber got married in 2019, in the Montage Palmetto Bluff hotel, in South Carolina, a year after the couple wedding in a private civil ceremony in New York.  For the rehearsal dinner, Hailey wore a Vivienne Westwood minidress, and a custom off-white wedding gown designed by her late friend and designer Virgil Abloh, with the phrase ‚ÄúTill death do us part‚Äù in the train, for the ceremony. For the wedding reception, she wore a Ralph & Russo dress with a halter neckline and also a Vera Wang slip dress with sneakers.  Usher, Joan Smalls, Justine Skye, Jaden Smith, Kris Jenner and her boyfriend Corey Gamble, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner and her daughter Stormi were some of the celebrities who attended the festivities. During the reception, Justin Bieber even sang ‚ÄúOne Last Only Girl‚Äù to Hailey Bieber.  Karlie Kloss  Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner were married in October in a small Jewish ceremony in New York. In that day, the supermodel wore a custom made Dior gown. The couple had a second wedding at Brush Creek Ranch, in Wyoming, with only 80 guests. Some of them were: Derek Blasberg, Diane von Furstenberg, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Mila Kunis, Princess Beatrice, Ivanka Trump and Serena Williams. The weekend was full of activities like karaoke, horseback riding, paintball and fireworks.  Lais ribeiro  Last year the Brazilian supermodel and Victoria‚Äôs Secrets Angel, Lais Ribeiro, got married to the former professional basketball player, Joakim Noah, in Trancoso, Bahia. The model wore a custom made dress by Galia Lahav and feets in the sand. Some days before the couple said ‚Äúyes‚Äù in a religious ceremony at Miguel Alves, Lais‚Äô hometown.  Some models like Candice Swanepoel, Sara Sampaio, Jasmine Tookes and basketball players like Derrick Rose, Taj Gibson, Thabo Sefolosha e Luol Deng were some of the famous names at the party.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-  The article above was edited by Mariana do Patroc√≠nio.

"wedding","2023-05-13","00:00:00","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T00:21:23","Annelore Harrell  Bluffton Today  It had been a lovely garden wedding, beautiful bride, adoring groom, beaming parents, and grandparents.  This was an intimate wedding of former college roommates, BFFs and immediate family who came from far and wide -- Washington state, and California, Alabama, and Florida -- to celebrate at the Davenport House in Savannah. After the all-too-brief-but-charming ceremony conducted by a friend authorized as a notary, the crowd left en masse for the reception at a nearby restaurant, a buffet dinner in a private dining room.  Not like the 1950s, with our church weddings and parish hall receptions.  Mostly we married where we had gone to services all our lives, knew the minister, and members of the congregation, and where the restrooms were in the way back of the church.  And we had receiving lines.  After the pastor pronounced them man and wife, the newly married couple walked down the aisle with bridesmaids and groomsmen trailing behind, only to swing around and go back for the photographer to take pictures in front of the altar while guests waited for them to finish and form a receiving line in the parish hall, the bride and groom, his parents, her parents.  We shook hands, gave air kisses and congratulations to the groom, never the bride, and as soon as possible melted into the crowd to nibble on petit fours and finger sandwiches served by the bride‚Äôs friends, all decked out in formal gowns. We tried to sip on a cup of punch made from ginger ale over lime sherbet without sloshing it all over our wedding finery. We watched as the wedding cake was cut and the bride offered her groom the first bite. We waited impatiently for the bride to throw her bridal bouquet to the single ladies.  We painted ""Just Married"" in soap on all the windows of the newlyweds‚Äô car and tied strings of tin cans to the rear bumper to make a racket as they drove away for their honeymoon.  And yes, we threw rice.  It was fun, and you didn‚Äôt need to take out a second mortgage to pay for it.  Oh, there were exceptions, elaborate receptions, unique, imaginative, like the time Robert and Dickie Roebling of Modena Plantation on Skidaway Island used their massive barn, built to house Aberdeen Angus cattle, as a wedding reception venue when their daughter Ellin married Donnell Watkins in 1950. With dinner tables in the stalls, champagne in feed troughs, and flowers in water buckets, plus an orchestra and buffet, it was quite an affair.  However, a wedding is a wedding.  Whether eloping at midnight to a justice of the peace over the state line, or indulging in a bizarre ceremony in a Las Vegas chapel, at the altar of a grand cathedral, or in a friend‚Äôs backyard, the questions remain the same.  Do you promise to love honor and cherish, For better or worse? For richer or poorer? Forever and ever?  Amen and amen.

'I think it will have to be a surprise for you, just wait,' she said with a wink, adding that their honeymoon would be in Bora Bora.  As far as why she is the one, Sean said that they very close.

He called Brando ‚Äúa joke‚Äù for the less-than-dapper way that Brando dressed for the part of Don Corleone.  ‚ÄúIf you were raised where I was raised, guys in the mob were very well dressed and very elegant,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe used to go to a barber shop and you‚Äôd see them being groomed.‚Äù  But Brando, he said, ‚Äúwas from a different world.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe looked like a monkey,‚Äù Gilbert said.  BRANDO‚ÄôS SCRIPT TROUBLE  Gilbert, then 32, landed the wedding usher role after doing an off-Broadway play called ‚ÄúRosebed.‚Äù  Gilbert, who took up acting after leaving the Army and studied at the famous Actors Studio, said that he had read the best-selling 1969 novel ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù before being cast in the film.  ‚ÄúWe all read the book,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe felt it was a very powerful story. Gangster stories really work a lot.‚Äù  Gilbert, who also appeared in ‚ÄúThe Usual Suspects‚Äù and numerous other films and TV shows during a long Hollywood career, said that Brando didn‚Äôt learn all his lines for ‚ÄúThe Godfather.‚Äù During filming, he said, dialogue was stuck to the chests of other actors, written on the ceiling or on cue cards.  Movie historians say that part of the reason was because ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù director Francis Ford Coppola was constantly rewriting the script and there was no time for Brando to learn the lines.  But according to Gilbert, Brando, another Actors Studio alum, ‚Äúwanted everything to be natural.‚Äù  MOM‚ÄôS WEDDING CAKE  The wedding scene was filmed at the so-called ‚ÄúGodfather house‚Äù at 110 Longfellow Ave. on Emerson Hill.  Many Staten Islanders were extras in the scene and the multi-tiered wedding cake was created by Oven Bake Shop in Port Richmond.  Gilbert said he spent three weeks on set and said that his brother still has one of the small dolls that decorated the wedding cake.  ‚ÄúI never had real lines,‚Äù he said of the scene. ‚ÄúI was there, walking around.‚Äù  He said he remembered jogging at a nearby school track during filming breaks.  Bride Connie Corleone was playing by Talia Shire, who was director Coppola‚Äôs sister.  Gilbert said that Shire considered the ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù wedding cake to be her mother‚Äôs wedding cake because her parents, Carmine and Italia Coppola, had eloped.

(Staten Island Advance photo)Staten Island Advance  Carmine Coppola did music for all three ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù films as well as for other Coppola movies including ‚ÄúApocalypse Now.‚Äù  Gilbert said one peculiar restriction was in place while the wedding scene was being filmed.  ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt allow us to dance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe couldn‚Äôt dance with the women. It was kind of strange.‚Äù  Gilbert said that when not filming the wedding scene, he and other extras acted as ‚Äúmob guys‚Äù in other ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù scenes.  ‚ÄúAll the extras were trying to get in front of the camera,‚Äù he said, adding that many of the background actors in the film were more mob-authentic than the lead players.  STILL GETS RESIDUALS  Gilbert said that a friend of his, Carmine Caridi, was in line to play hot-headed oldest Corleone son, Sonny, in the film.  But Caridi was nixed because, at 6-feet-3-inches tall, he was thought to be too tall to play opposite Al Pacino, who played Michael Corleone and is listed at 5-feet-6-inches.  James Caan played Sonny and was nominated for an Academy Award.  Caridi, however, later played Carmine Rosato in ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part II‚Äù and Albert Volpe in ‚ÄúThe Godfather Part III.‚Äù He is one of only a handful of actors to play two different roles in the ‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù films.  Veteran actor Ron Gilbert played a wedding usher in the landmark 1972 gangster movie ""The Godfather."" (Photo courtesy of Ron Gilbert)  Gilbert also said that there was obvious on-set ‚Äútension‚Äù between Pacino and actress Diane Keaton, who played his wife, Kay Adams. The two met on the film and would soon embark on a decades-long, on-off, romance.  ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt have to act,‚Äù Gilbert said. ‚ÄúThere was real tension between them.‚Äù  Gilbert said he still gets residuals from the film. When the 50th anniversary of ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù was celebrated last year, Gilbert said he received $50.  His name is also included on the cast list of ‚ÄúThe Godfather Trilogy,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúOver the years I have felt blessed to have been a part of that film,‚Äù he told Heart of Hollywood magazine.

When I first tried on my tux, I felt powerful and more like my queer self.  My Nanny's joy at seeing me and my partner in our tuxes helped me feel even more liberated.

When I came out as queer, it got harder. I started to question everything: Did I dress how I did because it was what I liked or because it was how I'd been told to dress in order to be desirable to men?  I realized patriarchal standards have been instilled in me since birth. Those standards are braided with my own need to be desired and loved.  But at 26, I wasn't dating a man, so I didn't feel the need to look feminine for the first time. I thought about how I genuinely wanted to present myself to the world.  I started small: a pair of short purple overalls, too loose to show off my breasts. I then went for sunset-colored Crocs, which a lot of people find ugly. Then it was an oversize orange-creamsicle button-up shirt ‚Äî too masculine to make it into my former closet.  But when I wore a tuxedo to my family member's wedding, that's when I felt truly liberated.  When my partner's cousin got married, I couldn't stomach the idea of performing femininity as I'd done so many times before  By 2022, the rituals of dresses, makeup, and heels had grown foreign. The wedding was black tie, and my partner, a nonbinary trans-masculine person, decided they would be wearing a tuxedo. I wanted to join them.  When we walked into Men's Warehouse, the nice lesbian in a striped, collared shirt and tie met our eyes right away. She knew we needed her. She wrapped a measuring tape around my waist, found a shirt big enough to fit my chest, and gently pinned cuff links into my sleeves.  When I looked at myself in the mirror in the tux for the first time, it felt like my queerness and burgeoning gender queerness were announced to the world.  My feet were sweaty inside the stiff dress shoes, but I felt powerful.  Without my partner by my side, I usually passed as a straight girl, but in my tux, men would see me and know that I wasn't interested. Women would see me and not expect me to perform the usual rituals of cis-heterosexual femininity with them: the curling of hair, the complaining about boyfriends. Other queers would see me and know I was one of them.  I couldn't wait to see our grandmother's reaction when she saw me in my tux  My partner and I loaded our backpacks and garment bags into the car and made the two-hour drive from Philadelphia to the Baltimore suburbs where my partner's grandparents lived. When my own family couldn't accept me, Nanny and PopPop welcomed me into theirs as another grandchild with unprecedented ease, and we visited them often.  Nanny had always loved all things fancy. She was also a few years into her dementia diagnosis. She often didn't know she was in her own home, but she remembered that she loved us.  We planned to get ready at Nanny and PopPop's house, lugging our garment bags inside for a pre-wedding visit. With so much of the familiar now unfamiliar to her, anxiety and fear clouded her days. Maybe being part of our fancy day would bring her joy.  When we walked out of the guest room in our crisp tuxes and matching blue pocket squares, she gasped and beamed with joy.  ""This is just wonderful!"" she exclaimed, a soft hand thrown over her mouth. She thought we were getting married right then and there in her living room, and she was thrilled to be included.  Raised in Southern Baptist Christianity, no one in my family celebrates my queer love. So I'll never forget Nanny's hands clapping together and the grin that stretched across her face when she saw my partner and me in our outfits.  At the wedding, I felt truly myself in my tux  When we got to the wedding, most of our family only quietly tolerated our visible display of queerness. But it didn't matter. My partner and I weren't asking for their approval or excitement. We already had the celebration we needed.  At the wedding, we twirled and spun around on the dance floor, taking up our own space, being exactly ourselves ‚Äî just the way Nanny liked us.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL3dvcmUtdHV4LWluc3RlYWQtZHJlc3MtZmFtaWx5LXdlZGRpbmctcXVlZXItMjAyMy010gFOaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zaWRlci5jb20vd29yZS10dXgtaW5zdGVhZC1kcmVzcy1mYW1pbHktd2VkZGluZy1xdWVlci0yMDIzLTU_YW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

As the couple's fifth wedding anniversary approaches, we've taken a look at some stunning throwback photos of the mother-of-the-bride shared by the couple in their Netflix docuseries Harry & Meghan. Released in December 2022, the series shared several never-before-seen glimpses inside the royal wedding, which took place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.  WATCH: Meghan Markle kisses King Charles in sweet behind-the-scenes wedding moment  After exchanging vows in front of the cameras, the newlyweds hosted private receptions at Windsor Castle and Frogmore House where they could celebrate with friends and family away from the public eye. One black-and-white photo showed Doria front and centre of the crowd as Elton John performed on the piano.  While everyone gathered around to watch the famous singer, Doria appeared particularly lost in the music as she gazed at Elton dressed in her pale green Oscar de la Renta dress with a matching coat decorated with white floral embroidery. ""I couldn't find my mom because she had just beelined to the stage to watch Elton sing,"" Meghan laughed in the documentary.  More snaps of Doria show her arriving at the wedding ceremony with Prince Harry's ushers Thomas and Charlie van Straubenzee, kissing her new son-in-law on the cheek and raising her hand and cheering alongside Queen Camilla and Prince William at the wedding reception.  Doria and Thomas Markle got married in 1979, but they divorced in 1987 and continued to co-parent Meghan. Thomas was originally expected to attend the royal wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle, but just days beforehand he suffered a heart attack and told TMZ he was staying in America for an operation. ""They [doctors] will go in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed,"" he said.  ¬© Netflix Doria was spotted raising her hands at the wedding reception  At the time, Meghan released a statement which read: ""Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.""  ¬© Getty Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married in May 2018  She later told Oprah Winfrey that she felt ""betrayed"" after it emerged that the retired lighting director had staged paparazzi photos ahead of the royal wedding.  ""When I asked him, he said, 'No, absolutely not [that he hadn't been talking to the tabloids],'"" Meghan revealed.  ¬© Getty Doria Ragland looked beautiful in an Oscar de la Renta dress  But when she probed her father further, saying that she and Harry had offered to try and ""kill"" the news story if he was in fact telling the truth, Thomas wasn't able to say that he was. ""I said, I just need you to tell me and if you tell me the truth we can help. And he wasn't able to do that,"" said Meghan.  ""I genuinely can't imagine doing anything to intentionally cause pain to my child, so it's hard for me to reconcile that,"" she said.

It's been over four years since Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas married. They welcomed daughter Malti Marie Chopra Jonas last year in January. She was born via surrogacy. The couple has often spoken about the wedding. In a new interview, when asked 'why did you want it (her wedding with Nick) to be so big', Priyanka said the wedding was ‚Äòbig in scale‚Äô but still 'very intimate'  She told CNN, ""Because I never said I was subtle. Everything I do is big. I am a bold person. It (the wedding) was big in scale, but it was just a 110 people. It was the closest people to me and my husband, and we kept it very intimate. But I wanted to get married in a palace, with a 75-foot train, why not?""  For the first Christian ceremony, Priyanka wore a custom Ralph Lauren gown that took a total of 1,826 hours to make ‚Äì complete with pearls, beads, Swarovski crystals and a 75-foot train. The gown also had some special touches, including eight words in hand-stitched embroidery, which read: Nicholas Jerry Jonas, 1st December 2018, Madhu and Ashok, Om Namah Shivay (a Hindu mantra invoking Lord Shiva), family, hope, compassion and love.  For the second Hindu ceremony, Priyanka had worn a red lehenga by Sabyasachi Mukherjee. From Sophie Turner and then-fianc√© Joe Jonas to Priyanka and Nick's parents, everyone attended the wedding in Rajasthan. The couple, who dated for seven months before marrying, had finished off the Hindu and Christian celebrations with wedding receptions in Delhi and Mumbai.  Priyanka, who now lives in Los Angeles with Nick and their one-year-old daughter Malti, was last seen in Love Again.

Justin Tyler Fox posted a TikTok video of his wedding ceremony, where he confessed to his wife-to-be, Raven, there was something special about her ring. The tiny little stone at the base of her massive engagement ring wasn‚Äôt just a regular accent stone. It was made out of her tooth!  During his vows, Fox thanked his bride for being there for him ‚Äúafter he figured it all out‚Äù and acknowledged her ‚Äúdeep doubled-sided dimples‚Äù and ‚Äúbeautiful soul.‚Äù In the video, he then asked, ‚ÄúDo you remember the day when I knew for a fact that I was going to marry you?‚Äù He proceeded to tell the story of how during a group hiking trip his adventurous bride attempted to follow his lead and jump across a creek.  While he made it across without a problem, Raven missed the jump and landed on her face, which resulted in her chipping her two front teeth. What could have been an embarrassing moment made the groom realize there was something special about his future wife.  The groom said the incident made him realize she would follow him to any place on Earth for every adventure and challenge they embark on together as husband and wife. ‚ÄúI just remember thinking that this girl has literally fallen for me,‚Äù he joked before revealing he took a ‚Äúspecial stone‚Äù from their hike to remember that day and had it embedded into her engagement ring.  As he continued his vows, Fox said Raven asked him about the small embellishment at the time of his proposal. ‚ÄúYou asked me, ‚ÄòWhat is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?‚Äô ‚Ä¶ I told you, ‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be,‚Äô and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs my confession. I picked that stone up from the top of the waterfall that day.

Her dad Andre ‚ÄúAndy‚Äù Leroux was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two-and-a-half years ago and doesn‚Äôt have much time left.  ‚ÄúAs he puts it, he‚Äôs on his way out,‚Äù Brittany said. ‚ÄúHe was moved over to the palliative care unit and he‚Äôs making his journey to leave this world.‚Äù  She and her fianc√© John Reh got engaged a while ago ‚Äî but with two young kids, wedding plans just kept getting kicked down the line.

She and John decided on Wednesday they would marry Friday in a small ceremony held on the grounds of the H√¥tel-Dieu Grace Healthcare Centre in Windsor, so her father could come.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it would come together, but it did,‚Äù said the bride.  She credits the support of her family and friends, as well as Transition to Betterness, the local charity helping keep her father comfortable, with making it all possible.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing what they did to help us have this day, so that I could have it with my dad before he passes,‚Äù said Brittany.  Her father, Andy, called it a ‚Äúvery, very exciting day.‚Äù  He said he was extremely happy to be able to be there to see it, and to see his family and friends at the ceremony.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy. It makes my heart tick real nice,‚Äù said Andy.  He brought his daughter down the aisle beaming with equal parts joy and pride ‚Äì rolling along side her in his wheelchair.  Brittany said she had to be mindful of the moment, so as not to let it pass too quickly.  ‚ÄúI had to force myself to think about it and stop and stay in the moment,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI was looking around at everybody and then I had to stop and look down at my dad‚Äôs hand‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the same hand that I grew up looking at.

I can‚Äôt have anything better than this.‚Äù  Before giving her away at the alter, Andy offered Brittany and John a bit of advice.  ‚ÄúLove one another, be kind to one another and respect one another more than anything you ever have in your entire life,‚Äù advised Andy.  He said he knows John to be the type of person to do that for his daughter.  Linda Santos, office manager for Transition to Betterness, said they are all about comfort ‚Äì but this is the first time they‚Äôve been involved in a wedding.  ‚ÄúThis is a first so we‚Äôre very excited,‚Äù she said.  Brittany and John were married in the Dr. Lisa Ventrella-Lucente Healing Garden outside the healthcare centre ‚Äì a space that just opened last summer, named for the former Transition to Betterness board member who died in 2015.

Hucky says the association‚Äôs website has the resources homeowners need.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very large list of people broken up by region local beekeepers that will come and assist you and take that hive off your hands, typically free of charge,‚Äù he said.  However, once the bees have found a quarter-inch hole or larger on the side of a home and move into the eaves or walls it can become pricey. There‚Äôs no set price within the industry and cutout services can range from a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.  Hucky said homeowners want to make sure they hire someone that understands the construction and has the proper tools for the job.  While someone‚Äôs first response to a honeybee swarm might be to grab the insect spray and kill the bees, Hucky said please don‚Äôt do it for a variety of reasons.  ‚ÄúIf the spray was to kill the hive you still have all that brood and all that honey and it will be like having a large dead animal in the wall,‚Äù Hucky said. ‚ÄúIf that hives been poisoned, you‚Äôre not only poisoning that hive you could potentially poison other hives in the area.‚Äù  He said other honeybees will pick up the scent left behind by the propolis in the hive and could visit the poisoned hive and then carry the pesticide to other hives in the area several miles away. The good news is while honeybees can swarm at any time, they predominately swarm between April and June, which means we‚Äôre about midway through this year‚Äôs swarm season.  If you find the need for a beekeeper to take care of a swarm in your area, visit the SWOBA website and click the ‚ÄòSwarm Removal‚Äô link at the top of the page.  SWOBA‚Äôs President Yaser Almusawy encourages property owners to plant bee-friendly flowers.

Ros√¢ngela Renn√≥‚Äôs Wedding Landscape (1996) is made up of layers of large sheets of plexiglass, to which the artist glued strips of negatives she retrieved from a wedding photography studio in Havana in 1994. Before the work went on view in Chosen Memories, a survey of Latin American contemporary art currently on view at MoMA, our photography conservators made a routine assessment of the work‚Äôs condition. What they found‚Äîand the best way to treat it‚Äîturned out to be anything but routine.  ‚ÄúMaterials of film are generally held in an archive. So they‚Äôre typically not put on display,‚Äù explains Craig Kamrath, a photography conservation fellow, ‚ÄúBut in this instance, the film is what you‚Äôre there to look at, these strips of negatives.‚Äù  Photography conservator Lee Ann Daffner was baffled: ‚ÄúWhen I first saw this work, I didn‚Äôt know what to think, because we had so many questions.‚Äù For one, there was a white, powdery substance appearing throughout the layers of plexiglass. Was it mold, or the dreaded ‚Äúplexi disease‚Äù that can occur when a piece of plexiglass abrades, or something else? Daffner and Kamrath worked with conservation scientist Catherine H. Stephens and conservation science fellow Kyna Biggs to take samples and analyze them. But then another problem presented itself: these negatives, made of cellulose acetate, have a limited shelf life before they begin degrading. Thorough detective work needed to be done to determine the age of the negatives and how much acetic acid they were off-gassing, a sign of their decay. And was the plexiglass helping or hurting their condition?  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right on the doorstep with this artwork,‚Äù Kamrath said. The discoveries are constantly unfolding in our latest episode of Conservation Stories.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vbWEub3JnL21hZ2F6aW5lL2FydGljbGVzLzkwM9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She does it all for weddings from the tristate area to South Florida and beyond! (By does it all I mean that she makes your life a million times easier!)  I spent a day with Lauren so she could show me all the latest unique wedding ideas for the modern bride.  Party planning, gifts, and invitations: Box Bar  Lauren started me off at Box Bar in Old City! A bridal accessories store that specializes in the customization of EVERYTHING you need for your big day.  After you get engaged there's going to be a lot of gift giving (there are engagement gifts, bridal party bags, hotel gifts for guests, and wedding day items) and Box Bar has them all. Remember, you also have to invite all your friends and family everywhere too. There are engagement parties, bachelorette parties, bridal showers and of course, the wedding, so come check out their invitation room and get these events started!  Bridal hair: Jason Matthew Salon  At your wedding, it's your time to stand out. So, you want a hairstyle that's on trend but still unique.  I stopped by Jason Matthew Salon off Chestnut Street for an appointment with Jackie, bridal hair extraordinaire. She tells me, while it's still classic, the updo isn't as popular as it used to be!  So Jackie made a deep side part, curled my entire head, and added some rhinestones. And just like that, I'm a bride!  Shoe changes:    Yes...wearing heels all day HURTS! Lauren says she's noticed a trend in brides opting for comfort during the reception with customized sneakers for brides and grooms too!  Luckily, comfortable shoes can still be cute and reflect your style. If athletic shoes aren't your thing, you can spring for a tennis shoe with glitter or lace details.

What really set Kate‚Äôs look apart was that she took matters into her hands by reportedly doing her very own makeup. Ahead of her nuptials, the princess is said to have taken several private lessons with Bobbi Brown makeup artist Hannah Martin; the goal was for her to be able to expertly apply her desired look on the big day. Lucky for you, since Kate took a DIY approach to her glam, reproducing her fresh-faced complexion is very attainable, and that's true whether you do your own makeup or hire a professional. Although the royal bride is said to have used all Bobbi Brown products for her special day, you can tap any of your favorite brands to replicate her no-makeup makeup look.  If you‚Äôre obsessed with Kate‚Äôs timeless, understated glam and want to achieve a similar look on your own wedding day, we talked to a professional makeup artist to learn how to do just that. Ahead, the expert reveals a step-by-step process that‚Äôs easy to follow.  John Phillips / Getty Images  Step 1: Start With a Glowing Complexion  The secret to Kate‚Äôs effortless look is beginning with a flawless base. Schultz suggests using a medium-coverage foundation with a natural finish, such as Makeup by Mario SurrealSkin Foundation, to conceal imperfections without looking caked on. Then, she recommends applying a light concealer under the eyes to even out the skin tone and correct discoloration. According to the makeup artist, Tarte Shape Tape Concealer will accomplish this.  Step 2: Add Color to Your Cheeks  The Princess of Wales‚Äô pink tint on her cheeks was the focal point of her soft glam. To duplicate the royal bride‚Äôs rosy look, Schultz advises adding a pink blush, like Dior Backstage Rosy Glow Blush, to the apples of your cheeks for a healthy, vibrant touch. Wondering how to find this spot on your face? Smile. The front parts that pop up are the apples.  Step 3: Define Your Eyebrows  Eyebrows are one feature you don‚Äôt want to overlook for your day-of glam. On Kate‚Äôs wedding day, her brows were full, groomed, and pronounced. To produce the same definition and fill in sparse areas, Schultz says to use an eyebrow pencil, such as MAC Cosmetics Eye Brows Styler.  Step 4: Create a Smokey Eye  Kate went with a gray smokey eye on her big day, which added a dramatic flair to her subdued look. According to Schultz, applying a bone-colored eyeshadow across your lid and up to the browline will create a bright base. Then, take a gray shade (or a medium-brown hue for a more subtle look) and swipe it across your crease. The end result? You‚Äôll contour and define the eye shape, the makeup artist notes.  Step 5: Line the Eyes  ‚ÄúEyeliner is a big feature for this look, so don‚Äôt be afraid to go bold!‚Äù Schultz remarks. Choose a liner in a dark tone, whether it‚Äôs brown, navy, or black, and line the upper lid and lower lid beneath your eyelashes with the product. For this step, the makeup artist suggests Make Up For Ever Aqua Resist Color Pencil. To make your eyes look bigger and brighter, she recommends using a white eyeliner, like NYX Cosmetics Jumbo Eye Pencil, along the waterline. Don‚Äôt forget to finish off the look with a waterproof mascara for fluttery, voluminous lashes.  Step 6: Apply a Faint Lipstick  The final step of Kate‚Äôs look is elevating the lips with a pink color featuring a satin finish. To mirror the bride‚Äôs pretty tint, Schultz loves NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil in ‚ÄúSex Machine.‚Äù Before you apply the shade, consider locking in moisture with a hydrating lip balm. Once you‚Äôve finished applying all of your cosmetics, spritz on a setting spray, so your look lasts all night.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20va2F0ZS1taWRkbGV0b24td2VkZGluZy1tYWtldXAtcmVjcmVhdGUtdGlwcy03NTAwMDQ30gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, this year, the Royal Horticultural Society is trying to make the show ‚Äì and horticulture ‚Äì more inclusive, by putting on special events for children, and encouraging the creation of gardens with an accessibility theme.  For the first time in its 110-year history, a picnic for children will take place at the show, with attendees coming from 10 schools in the most disadvantaged areas of London. After the event finishes, some of the show gardens will be transported into the grounds of schools that lack green space, in the hope it sparks a love of the outdoors in children who otherwise have little access to nature.  Chelsea will also be hosting its first wedding, between the garden designer Manoj Malde and his partner, Clive Gillmor. They plan to tie the knot on Monday in the garden Malde designed for the show, which has a theme of unity and diversity.  Malde said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that people know the RHS isn‚Äôt just about their shows and gardens, it also does a lot in the community ‚Äì then people will begin to understand that it‚Äôs not elitist.  Malde in the garden he has designed. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  ‚ÄúHow on earth is anyone going to accuse the RHS of being elitist when they are going to have the first RHS Chelsea wedding between a gay Indian man and a gay Irish man? [The garden designer] James Alexander Sinclair is going to be the celebrant. I‚Äôm thrilled. We‚Äôve had the outfits made in India and I‚Äôve asked all the ladies in my family to wear saris, so it‚Äôll be really nice to have that tradition as well.‚Äù  Malde‚Äôs garden will celebrate his heritage, with a colour scheme of orange and pink, marigolds used in Hindu worship, and colourful spices set out on a table alongside small oil lamps used at festivals and religious ceremonies. The garden will also feature Asian fruit and vegetables.  In the Great Pavilion there will be a display celebrating female gardeners; for the first time in the show‚Äôs history more designers are female than male.  The RHS‚Äôs director of shows and gardens, Helena Pettit, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so important to us that gardening is accessible to everyone, so we are really pleased that this is such a strong theme running throughout this year‚Äôs show.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an ongoing project which will always need further work, but we have made a concerted effort to make sure RHS Chelsea flower show this year is demonstrably open.‚Äù  Staff prepare Horatio‚Äôs Garden which will be wheelchair accessible. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  Many of the gardens have themes of accessibility, including that of the charity Horatio‚Äôs Garden, which is designed to be wheelchair accessible. The charity creates accessible and sustainable gardens in spinal centres and this particular garden will be moved after the show to the Princess Royal spinal injuries centre in Sheffield.

It will grow crops and herbs eaten by asylum seeker communities in the UK. The garden will later be relocated to Good Food Matters in Croydon, a community scheme that provides marginalised groups space and support to grow and cook their own food.  The Choose Love Garden. Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian  The School Food Matters garden is designed with children in mind. Paths will be child-sized, allowing them to create their own imagined worlds as they meander past plants and scramble over boulders surrounded by bright flowers. It is also full of crops, including radishes and beans, and it will inspire the creation of two gardens by the gardeners at schools in London and Liverpool.  The Memoria & GreenAcres Transcendence Garden is designed for bereaved people, with tall trees and flowing water aimed at creating a sense of peace.  The designers Amelia Bouquet and Emilie Bausager are making their RHS Chelsea debut with the Platform Garden. Inspired by unused overground station platforms in London, the garden, which features concrete bins as planters and novel ways to harvest rainwater, will eventually be installed at a nearby station.  Pettit said:‚ÄúA requirement this year is that every garden lives on after the show, whether it be in a hospital, a school or a community space, so thousands of people will benefit from these gardens for years to come. For too long, gardening has not been as open as it should be to people from all walks of life, and we need to tackle this at all levels.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9saWZlYW5kc3R5bGUvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTkvZ2F5LXdlZGRpbmctYW5kLXNjaG9vbGNoaWxkcmVuLXRvLWZlYXR1cmUtYXQtaW5jbHVzaXZlLWNoZWxzZWEtZmxvd2VyLXNob3fSAX9odHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vbGlmZWFuZHN0eWxlLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2dheS13ZWRkaW5nLWFuZC1zY2hvb2xjaGlsZHJlbi10by1mZWF0dXJlLWF0LWluY2x1c2l2ZS1jaGVsc2VhLWZsb3dlci1zaG93?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Subscribe | UPI Odd Newsletter Subscribe May 19 (UPI) -- One lucky winner in the North Carolina lottery is making good on two promises -- one, to have and to hold, and the other, the cash to pay for his pledge for a dream wedding.

"wedding","2023-05-13","14:00:00","{""Durban"", ""KwaZuluNatal"", ""SouthAfrica""}","2023-05-19T13:10:00","You've been invited to both a bridal shower and a wedding‚Äîcongrats! It's always nice to know that friends or family members want you to participate in their special celebration and the events leading up to the big day. But one question guests are often faced with is whether you must purchase both a gift for the bridal shower and a gift for the wedding day.  If you're unsure about the proper etiquette around gift-giving during big wedding events, fear not. We ask an industry expert and etiquette extraordinaire all about the difference between bridal shower gifting and wedding gifts‚Äîand whether or not both are necessary for guests invited to both of these events.    Meet the Expert Diane Gottsman is an etiquette expert and owner of The Protocol School of Texas in San Antonio, Texas.  Should I bring a gift to both the bridal shower and the wedding?  The short answer here is: Yes. Technically, these are two separate events, and traditionally, it is proper etiquette for guests to show up to the bridal shower with a gift, and also purchase a gift for the wedding (this is typically done via a wedding registry, but it's also fine to bring a present in-person to the wedding).  ""Since these are two separate occasions, and often the registry for both is different, sending or bringing a gift to each is appropriate,"" explains etiquette expert Diane Gottsman, owner of The Protocol School of Texas. ""It's best to send the wedding gift ahead of time so you don‚Äôt have to carry it to the wedding,"" she notes.  What if I can't afford to bring a gift to both events?  We're no stranger to the fact that being a wedding guest can get very pricey, very fast. Between gifts, buying or renting an outfit, attending pre-wedding events, and travel/accommodation costs, being a wedding guest is expensive‚Äîespecially when you have multiple weddings a year. If you're feeling like you can't swing purchasing both a bridal shower gift and a wedding shower gift, it's most likely that the marrying couple will understand‚Äîyour presence is the real present!  If you do find yourself in this situation and want to give the couple a gift for both events, Gottsman recommends dividing your gift budget in half and splitting it between two smaller presents. ""It‚Äôs all about how you spend your dollars on the gift,"" she explains. ""If you are invited to a shower, it would probably be uncomfortable to show up without a gift, and the same for the wedding,"" she says. ""However, spending a much smaller amount [each gift] and making them sentimental and meaningful‚Äînot expensive‚Äîis the key.""  Should I send a gift to the couple if I can't attend the shower or the wedding?  If you're unable to attend the shower or the wedding (don't forget to RSVP on time!), Gotssman advises that whether or not to still send a gift is a bit nuanced. ""It depends on the relationship you share,"" she says. ""If you aren‚Äôt a good friend or family member, and you aren‚Äôt planning on attending either one (or only attending one), you can just bring a gift to the particular celebration you attend,"" she explains. ""If you are a very close family member or friend, you can decide how you will feel the next time you see [the couple]."" By this, she means if you think you'll be stressed about whether they'd notice that you didn't send a gift in lieu of your attendance, you should send one. However, if you think the couple simply won't mind either way, then it's fine to pass on the gift.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYnJpZGFsLXNob3dlci1naWZ0cy12ZXJzdXMtd2VkZGluZy1naWZ0cy1ldGlxdWV0dGUtNzQ5OTg2NdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""NewYork"", ""NewYork"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T13:20:00","Every bride wants to look and feel their best on their wedding day, and luminous skin plays a big role in boosting day-of confidence. A flawless complexion doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, however, so many brides-to-be follow a detailed skincare regimen up to a year before they tie the knot to achieve this sought-after radiance. And while your pre-wedding beauty routine will vary depending on the person, one integral component for most is getting frequent facials. These spa treatments for the face guarantee a natural glow and a blemish-free base to let your wedding makeup products work their magic.  According to licensed esthetician Shannon Marks, most brides should start getting facials every month at least three to six months before the big day. ‚ÄúThis will give the skin enough time to respond to the treatments and show improvement,‚Äù she explains. If you‚Äôre dealing with a certain skin concern, such as acne, hyperpigmentation, or fine lines and wrinkles, Marks recommends working with an esthetician even sooner and receiving more consistent treatment.  Regardless of your skin type, Kira Igbowu of Full Frontal Beauty & Esthetics suggests starting your facial regimen at least three months out. ‚ÄúOnce we hit the three-month mark, a monthly facial is imperative as the focus should now be on hydrating, plumping, calming, and feeding the skin with all the yummy goodness it needs before the big day,‚Äù she says.  Since every bride has a different complexion and desire for their day-of skin, though, many facials are tailored specifically to their needs, which is why Marks advises everyone to do an in-person consultation ahead of starting any treatment. That being said, we talked to a handful of estheticians to get a rundown on the most popular facials for brides, the treatment process for each, and the end result. From acne-targeting treatments to hydrating ones, here are the best facials to get before your wedding day.  Meet the Expert Shannon Marks is a licensed esthetician with seven years of experience and is the owner of Shannon Lee Esthetics in New York City.  Kira Igbowu is the founder and chief skin therapist at Full Frontal Beauty & Esthetics in Brooklyn. She‚Äôs been working in the skincare industry for nearly 20 years.  Carol Dobson Zubrin is an organic esthetician and holistic facialist with more than 18 years of experience. She‚Äôs also the owner of Purity Organic Facials in San Luis Obispo and Templeton, California and Purity Organic Spa in Los Angeles, California.  Taylor Worden is an esthetician at Taylor Worden Skin in New York City who has been working in the skincare space for 10 years.  Collagen Facial  According to Everyday Health, a loss of collagen naturally happens as we age, leading to dull skin, uneven pigment, loss of volume, fine lines, and wrinkles. And since collagen is responsible for the skin‚Äôs structure and elasticity, a facial that increases this protein in our body is loaded with benefits for future brides. Specifically, with a collagen facial, you‚Äôll be able to reverse any collagen loss and restore your skin‚Äôs vibrancy and youthfulness.  Organic esthetician Carol Dobson Zubrin offers a Phyto Collagen Renewal Facial, which incorporates a mask infused with plant collagen to reduce the appearance of unwanted lines and correct your skin tone. She shares that the treatment is a favorite with her clients because it‚Äôs perfect for any skin type and is often a go-to before significant events, including weddings.  HydraFacial  HydraFacials are another popular choice for brides-to-be. During this spa treatment, your esthetician will use a hydrodermabrasion device to cleanse, exfoliate, and extract your skin before delivering serums. Almost immediately, you‚Äôll notice firmer and more hydrated skin, which is why this treatment has become a highly-requested choice. ‚ÄúA HydraFacial can improve the overall health of the skin, leaving it brighter and more radiant for the bride‚Äôs big day,‚Äù Marks says. The best part? Since the facial is pretty gentle, any skin type will be able to tolerate it. You can also customize it so that it targets your specific concern, whether it‚Äôs acne, hyperpigmentation, or dry skin, Marks adds.  LED Facial  During this facial, LED lights penetrate the skin, which allows the body to increase cell turnover and jumpstart the skin renewal process. As a result, this treatment boosts collagen production, decreases hyperpigmentation, reduces wrinkles, and fights breakouts, leading to more volume and radiance for any type of complexion. Zubrin suggests her Pure Luxury Facial Treatment if hyperpigmentation is one of your concerns. It uses red or blue LED light therapy combined with a collagen mask to conceal sun spots, heal the skin, and create an undeniable glow.  Radio Frequency Facial  Looking for a nonsurgical alternative to a facelift? Igbowu recommends including radio frequency into your pre-wedding facial plan. This treatment uses an electromagnetic device that generates heat to stimulate collagen and elastin production, which lifts sagging skin, according to the skin therapist. You‚Äôll also notice a more youthful appearance, better texture, and fewer fine lines.  Microcurrent Facial  Another type of facial that guarantees similar results to a facelift is a microcurrent facial. Igbowu explains that this painless, non-invasive treatment uses low-voltage electricity to stimulate the facial muscles, creating a lifted, tightened, and toned effect. Not only are the results instantaneous, but this treatment will also prevent future sagging. It's also a great choice as it accommodates any skin type and requires zero downtime.  Lymphatic Drainage Facial  To Zubrin, a must-have facial for all brides is one that incorporates lymphatic drainage. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a gentle, incredibly relaxing facial massage that drains toxins, bacteria, and chemicals that are collected in the lymph under the skin, toward the lymph nodes, so that your body can eliminate it, and new, fresh lymph takes its place,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my clients‚Äô all-time favorite and the most effective treatment that I do.‚Äù  But what does this facial actually entail? A provider will use their hands or sculpting tools to gently massage the face, which increases circulation and rids waste, according to mindbodygreen. This movement also prompts the lymphatic system to heal, leading to an improvement in puffy, dry, dull, sensitive, or acne-prone skin.  Oxygen Facial  Our skin relies on oxygen to create new cells, and a lack of oxygen makes the skin look dull and drab. Enter: the oxygen facial, a go-to with celebrities, like Madonna and Ashley Graham. With this treatment, your provider will use a wand to deliver high-pressurized oxygen to the skin‚Äôs surface, according to Healthline. The end result? Less fine lines and wrinkles, a boost in blood circulation, and an increase in collagen production for clearer, softer skin. Generally, this type of facial is gentle, so any future bride will benefit.  Dermaplaning Facial  Dermaplaning is the latest buzzword in the beauty space, and it‚Äôs a favorable option for brides-to-be. This non-invasive facial treatment uses a scalpel to exfoliate the skin and remove peach fuzz and dead skin cells, leading to a brighter, softer, smoother complexion, according to Igbowu. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs painless, has zero downtime, and the results are immediate,‚Äù she concludes. Not to mention, dermaplaning allows serums and makeup products to penetrate your skin, delivering better results. Just a word of caution: If you have sensitive skin or are dealing with breakouts, this treatment has the potential to inflame your skin.  Chemical Peel  Although chemical peels often get a bad rap as harsh treatments that require a long recovery, Marks explains that VI chemical peels with medium strength are suitable for all skin types and concerns. This kind of peel contains ingredients, such as salicylic acid, vitamin C, and phenol, which remove dead skin and reveal a more youthful appearance and even skin tone. The esthetician mentions that it also fights acne and hyperpigmentation. ‚ÄúI love to perform this peel weeks prior to an event for that perfect glow the day of the event,‚Äù she says.  Custom Facial  Since no two brides have the same skin, a custom facial will suit your specific needs, concerns, and skin type. Every process is different, but usually, your esthetician will start by cleansing the surface of your skin, determining a treatment plan after a skin analysis, exfoliating the skin, removing impurities with extractions, and completing the facial with customized masks and serums, according to Marks.  Esthetician Taylor Worden explains that she only offers customized facials at her New York City-based spa, Taylor Worden Skin. Her treatments typically focus on lifting, depuffing, and hydrating through exfoliation, LED light, massage, microcurrent, and masks. Regardless of the type of facial your esthetician creates for you, though, your skin will look glowy and bright afterward.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYmVzdC1mYWNpYWxzLWJlZm9yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTc0OTg0ODbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Netflix star, 41, told E! News that the big day when she married the Australian musician, 29, won't be included in the show, the sixth season of which begins streaming Friday. (Season 7 has already been confirmed and begun filming.)  ""I think that it's a balance thing on a show like this, of what to share and what not to share, and I think that it is important that we are open and we shine a light on a love that I think is so beautiful,"" Stause said. ""But that being said, it's also important to keep some things for us.""  She added that the secret Las Vegas ceremony was ""imperfectly perfect,"" and that the couple hope to celebrate the same way, every year to come.  Megan Rasmussen  ""We promised we're going to just do it every year, whether it's another Vegas situation or somewhere else,"" Stause said. ""But just every year, something around the same time, spontaneous, fun, get everybody together and every single year, just celebrate.""  The real estate agent recently shared the details of her sweet and ""small"" wedding with PEOPLE.  ""It was a very small group there with us and some friends and family watching on a live stream,"" she told PEOPLE exclusively. The couple only gave those closest to them a heads up about their ""I dos"" in advance so they could tune in from afar.  Megan Rasmussen  For the ceremony, Stause wore a floor-length, pearlescent white gown by Gemeli Power and heeled sandals, and carried a bouquet of white roses. G Flip wore a suit by Melbourne-based designer E Nolan with a tie, sunglasses and white sneakers.  Following the ceremony, the newlyweds shared their joy via photos in front of the Las Vegas Strip sign and a graffitied wall that featured the words, ""Will you marry me?""  Stause later posted an Instagram reel that featured video snippets of her and G Flip enjoying time together.  ""Love doesn't always go as planned‚Ä¶ Sometimes it's immeasurably better,"" Stause captioned the reel, which showed a picture of them married at the end.  The road to marriage was a year-long love affair for the two, who found themselves compatible despite coming from ""different corners of the world,"" G Flip recalled during an episode of the PEOPLE Every Day podcast.  ""We were both with our ex-partners [when we met] ... And then, we obviously separated from our partners, and we just started talking and stuff,"" they explained. ""We just found a lot of similarities, even though people would think we are from like different corners of the world. We find ourselves so similar sometimes.""  Even though their wedding won't be featured on the show, G Flip does make their Selling Sunset debut in season 6 alongside their partner.  When discussing being featured on the show with Vogue, they said, ""We could have kept everything quiet...""  ""But then ‚Ä¶ Then they win. They quiet you and take your voice,"" Stause cut in.

"wedding","2023-07-14","13:00:00","{""WestSpringfield"", ""Massachusetts"", ""UnitedStates""}","2023-05-19T13:00:23","If you have one or more friends getting married this summer, you may be excited for their big day. But you may also be wondering how much of a blow your savings account is about to take.  Travel can be expensive at any time of the year. But during the summer, the cost can be even higher. And when you're traveling for a wedding, you don't get a choice when it comes to things like the timing or destination. So you could end up staring at a pretty hefty credit card tab after all is said and done.  The good news, though, is that there are steps you can take to lower your wedding-related travel costs. Here are some tactics worth employing, especially if money is tight.  1. Road trip it rather than fly  If you're attending a wedding, chances are, you have some friends in common with the bride and groom. If you're willing to hop in a car with those people and split the drive, you might save yourself money compared to the cost of a flight.  As an example, let's say your wedding destination is six hours away by car, so it's a reasonable drive for a weekend, especially if you can split it with another driver or more. If a flight to your destination has you shelling out $300 but the cost of driving is $150 all in, you'll save money even if you drive by yourself. But if you find two other people to road trip it with, you'll spend just $50 each.  2. Use the right credit card to book your flight  Air travel can be costly, especially if you want the option to be able to pick your own seat. But if you use a travel rewards credit card to book your flight, you might reap some savings along the way.  It's common for these cards to offer free checked bags on flights, for example. If you're attending a wedding and different festivities related to it, sticking to a carry-on may not be feasible. So if you don't have to pay to check a bag, that alone might save you a nice amount of money.  3. Bunk with a bunch of friends at a private rental  It's common for couples getting married to encourage guests to stay at the same hotel so everyone is centrally located. But staying at a hotel could be costly, especially if the wedding is being held at a popular destination. If you know other people attending the wedding, it could make more financial sense to split the cost of a private rental for lodging.  As an example, a 3-bedroom home that sleeps six in Hyannis, Massachusetts on Cape Cod costs $978 to book for the weekend of July 21 through July 23 through VRBO. A standard room at the Hyannis Inn that sleeps two that same weekend costs $753. (These prices include taxes and fees.)  So if you have a group of six traveling to the same wedding, you might spend $163 per person to split the cost of the $978 rental, versus $376.50 per person to stay at the hotel. And the VRBO property might also make it easier to cook some meals while you're away, thereby helping you save on food costs.  There's no question that attending a wedding can cost a lot when there's a travel component. But if you take these steps, you might manage to lower your costs and minimize the financial burden. And that should put you in a better frame of mind to celebrate with the people you care about.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvY3JlZGl0LWNhcmRzL2FydGljbGVzL3RyYXZlbGluZy1mb3ItYS13ZWRkaW5nLXRoaXMtc3VtbWVyLTMtd2F5cy10by1zYXZlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

When it came time for the proposal five years later, Eddie was ready to go all out. ‚ÄúEddie had [long] had a vision of owning a ranch that would be a part of our entire life together,‚Äù Yunha shares. ‚ÄúBefore proposing, he secretly purchased an undeveloped, off-the-grid, 27-acre parcel of land in Petaluma, California. He then planted a tricolor beech tree, meant to symbolize an important day in our shared life together: our engagement.‚Äù On May 11, 2019, he drove Yunha to the land, got down on one knee, and asked her to marry him in front of the tree. The answer, of course, was a resounding yes, and they celebrated back in San Francisco with a surprise engagement party the groom-to-be had secretly arranged.  The property, which they named Edna Ranch (a combination of their first names), would indeed become a major part of the couple‚Äôs life together. During the pandemic, they camped beneath the beech tree nearly every other weekend, and for their wedding, they wanted to ‚Äúshare this special place in our lives with all our closest family and friends,‚Äù the couple says.  Of course, this presented some challenges. ""Physically getting vendors onsite [was difficult],‚Äù says wedding planner Elise Johnson. ‚ÄúThe property is accessible only through a series of one-way dirt roads, it had no physical address, and there was no cell reception or WiFi. Because the ranch is off-the-grid, it also has no water, no power, and no sewage.‚Äù Luckily, her firm had just the experience and vendor network to bring the bold vision to life‚Äîa vision that celebrated exactly that rustic nature. ""We wanted to echo the natural beauty of the incredibly special landscape, bringing in shades of green and wheat,‚Äù Yunha says. ‚ÄúInspired by the tricolor beech, we incorporated a blind embossed beech emblem into the paper goods and kept all our colors neutral and soft like the local foliage.‚Äù  Ahead, see all of the naturally beautiful details from their May 21, 2022, wedding day, planned by Elise Johnson of Shannon Leahy Events and photographed by Larissa Cleveland.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  ‚ÄúGiven my busy schedule as a founder and CEO of a tech startup, I had very limited time available to browse around and shop,‚Äù Yunha says of shopping for a wedding dress. ‚ÄúSo, I hired a wedding stylist, Maradee Wahl, who helped me choose and tailor my wedding dress. She was amazing!‚Äù The vision was clean and simple but still, well, bridal. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to later regret not wearing a big wedding dress‚Äîwhich you only get a chance to wear once‚Äîso I chose one that was clean and chic, but at the same time feels like a wedding dress,"" she explains. A Reem Acra ball gown fit the bill.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Groom Eddie wore a navy Tom Ford tuxedo with a shawl collar. He accessorized his look with cufflinks gifted from the bride‚Äôs parents.

Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Carving out space for the ceremony was no easy feat. ‚ÄúWe graded a rectangular portion of the land on Edna Ranch to make it flat enough to have the ceremony on,‚Äù the couple shares. ‚ÄúThe ceremony location had views of the beautiful rolling hills of Petaluma.‚Äù Their hard work will continue to go to good use: The couple plans to use the flattened portion of the property to host future events. ‚ÄúWe chose natural wood chairs and a low-profile stage framed by flowers ‚Äògrowing' from the ground; but the view was the real showstopper.‚Äù  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  A pair of adorable flower girls‚Äîand the couple‚Äôs nine-year-old Pomeranian, Omo, as ring bearer‚Äîled the procession before Yunha walked down the aisle with her father. ‚ÄúOur processional song was Pachelbel‚Äôs ‚ÄòCanon In D,‚Äô‚Äù the bride says. ‚ÄúWe had a live quartet led by Eddie‚Äôs youngest sister, Esther Kim, who is a violinist; her partner Joseph Kaiser, a cellist; and two of their friends who play professionally with the San Francisco Ballet and Opera orchestras.‚Äù  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  They asked their pastor, Will Moraza of Epic Church, to officiate, and wrote their own vows. ‚ÄúOur recessional was to ‚ÄòOur Song‚Äô by Taylor Swift, a song we both love and went well with the rural vibes.‚Äù  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  ‚ÄúWe wanted our guests to not just witness us getting married on the ranch, but also to enjoy a tour of it,‚Äù the couple says. ‚ÄúTo accomplish both, we carved a large circular walking path around the 27-acre ranch. Guests would arrive and make a big clockwise loop around the ranch as they walked to the ceremony, cocktail hour, then reception. Along the way, they could observe the tree that marked the spot where we got engaged.‚Äù  To make guests comfortable while also respecting the rural nature of the land, they erected sailcloth tents at the cocktail hour and reception spaces. And, there was one more surprise on the grounds. ‚ÄúYunha is an animal lover, and we‚Äôre on farmland, so we brought in a petting zoo for the kids‚Äîand adults!‚Äîto enjoy during cocktail hour.‚Äù  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  ‚ÄúEddie loves cajun food and Yunha loves Korean food,‚Äù the couple shares. ‚ÄúDuring cocktail hour, we served crawfish tostadas, catfish po‚Äô boy, boudin balls, bulgogi mushroom lettuce cups, and salmon nigiri, and had roving oyster shuckers. It was an interesting mix, but it worked well!‚Äù They leaned into local for the alcohol selection, serving Petaluma-based beers like Lagunitas and Henhouse and wine from Azari Vineyards and McEvoy Ranch.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Their 175 guests then stepped into the largest tent for the reception. ‚ÄúTables were draped in soft sage linens, and the chairs were reminiscent of tree branches,‚Äù the bride describes. ‚ÄúThe motif was continued on the poles in the tent, where our florist actually built ‚Äòtrees‚Äô on each pole; and the lighting team projected shadows of ancient oaks onto the rooftop of the tent and the dance floor.‚Äù  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Incongruent with the sophisticated place settings‚Äîin the best way possible‚Äîdinner was ultra casual. ""We share a passion for In-N-Out burgers,‚Äù the couple says. ‚ÄúInstead of the standard wedding dinner fare of fish or steak, we opted to serve In-N-Out-style burgers and fries with milkshakes. Each burger was wrapped with paper that said ‚ÄòYunha-N-Eddie.'‚Äô‚Äô  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  The process of putting together a wedding is just as memorable as the wedding itself.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  ‚ÄúInstead of a traditional wedding party walk-in for the reception, we decided to open the reception with a musical performance by the entire wedding party,‚Äù the couple says. ‚ÄúThe words of ‚ÄòI Can Hear the Bells‚Äô from Hairspray were rewritten to tell the story of how Eddie pursued Yunha and ultimately married her.‚Äù It was one of their favorite memories of the day. ‚ÄúMore than the performance itself, it was the months of rehearsing together with our closest friends that we remember. Yunha‚Äôs friends didn‚Äôt all know Eddie‚Äôs friends super well, and the rehearsals were a great way for everyone to get to know each other; everyone became a lot closer by the end of it. It made us both realize that the process of putting together a wedding is just as memorable as the wedding itself.""  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Their first dance was a nod to the venue they‚Äôd built together, ‚ÄúFrom the Ground Up‚Äù by Dan + Shay. ‚ÄúWe waltzed to this beautiful country song about building a life together,‚Äù the couple shares.  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  The bride changed into a sparkly cocktail-length frock by Monique Lhuillier to get the party started, but before everyone hit the dance floor, the bride and groom made sure that there was also an opportunity for guests to relax. ‚ÄúYunha is the founder and CEO of Simple Habit, the maker of the Simple Habit meditation app and Sleep Reset, so we created a secret outdoor meditation lounge hidden deep in the woods for guests to hang out in.‚Äù  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  Back inside the reception tent, the wedding party‚Äôs musical entrance wasn‚Äôt the only surprise dance‚Äîand the next one nearly went viral on TikTok. ""Yunha and her father first started waltzing to a beautiful song called ‚ÄòI Loved her First‚Äô by Heartland,‚Äù the couple recaps. ‚ÄúIn the middle of the waltz, the record scratches and suddenly ‚ÄòGangnam Style‚Äô starts playing. Yunha and her father donned sunglasses and start3e doing the Gangnam Style dance in perfect sync with each other. It was a complete surprise and the audience went wild!""  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  More of the couple‚Äôs favorite foods provided late-night fuel. ‚ÄúWe had a Shin Ramyun station, where we served individual cups of spicy ramen with hot water, a big pot of kimchi jjigae‚ÄîKorean kimchi stew, Yunha‚Äôs favorite dish‚Äîand spicy tteokbokki skewers.""  Photo by Larissa Cleveland  ‚ÄúAfter the last song‚Äî‚ÄòHave It All‚Äô by Jason Mraz‚Äîplayed, the entire wedding party camped on another section of the land,‚Äù the newlyweds reminisce. They‚Äôd built a small campsite with a dozen Shelter Co. tents for the wedding party to stay in, a nod to their own love of camping. ‚ÄúEveryone was sitting around the campfire, talking about how much fun they all had. It was nice to share an intimate evening together after the festivities ended. In the morning, we cooked breakfast using some portable stoves and cried as we said goodbye.‚Äù  The couple's biggest takeaway? ‚ÄúOur guests all told us that the most memorable parts of the wedding were the parts that were nontraditional: the musical wedding party entrance, serving burgers and fries for dinner, camping in tents afterward,‚Äù Eddie and Yunha share. ‚ÄúWe were a little nervous that these things wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äòwork,‚Äô but they all turned out to be big hits and the things that everyone still talks about. So, our advice is to examine every part of your wedding and think of ways to do something out of the ordinary.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1yYW5jaC13ZWRkaW5nLTc0OTk0NTLSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Courtesy Aric Hutchinson  ""She was so happy. I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful. And she just had a weird, like, calmness that night,"" said Hutchinson, who added that the wedding and reception were one of the best nights of his life.  According to a GoFundMe set up by Hutchinson's mother, Hutchinson broke both legs, parts of his face and his back, and suffered brain bleeds and numerous cuts in the accident. The two others in the golf cart with Hutchinson and Miller suffered injuries including severe road rash and open wounds, according to Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV.

Courtesy Aric Hutchinson  The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 mph in a 25 mph zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety. According to the toxicology report, Komoroski's blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit.  An attorney for Komoroski shared a statement after her arrest, saying: ""We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.""  On Wednesday, Hutchinson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Komoroski and several local bars and restaurants where she allegedly drank the night of the crash. Komoroski's employer and supervisor were also named in the lawsuit and are accused of ""pressuring"" her to attend a function and consume ""excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages"" the night of the accident, according to the lawsuit.  Komoroski's employer said in a statement there was not an ""officially organized employee function around drinking"" and Komoroski had just started training for the job.  Hutchinson said he's not ready to address Komoroski at this time.  ""I can't right now,"" he said. ""I'd like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.""  I know she's up there watching.  For now, he said he's focused on his recovery and trying to hold on to his happy memories with Sam.

In an interview with ABC, Aric Hutchinson broke down as he struggled to recall the incident that killed Samantha Miller, 34, and severely injured him moments after they left their wedding reception in South Carolina last month.  ‚ÄúThe last thing I remember her saying is she wanted the night to never end,‚Äù Hutchinson told Good Morning America (GMA).  Miller died after Jamie Lee Komoroski crashed into the golf buggy the newlyweds were using on a beach road close to the reception venue, causing it to roll over several times. Investigators say Komoroski was driving at 65mph in a 25mph zone, and had blood alcohol levels three times higher than the legal limit.  Miller, from Charlotte, North Carolina, died at the scene.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still trying to wrap my head around it. That night going from an all-time high to an all-time low, it‚Äôs pretty tough to try to comprehend,‚Äù said Hutchinson on GMA, but declined to comment on Komoroski.  Hutchinson suffered a brain injury, two broken legs and several fractures in his back and face. He recently returned home to the couple‚Äôs apartment after multiple surgeries. Miller‚Äôs brother and nephew, who were in the golf cart, were also injured.  ‚ÄúI remember waking up foggy, out of sorts. I could see my mom‚Äôs face and could tell something was wrong. ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs Sam, where‚Äôs Sam?‚Äô I asked her. That‚Äôs when she told me there was an incident and Sam didn‚Äôt make it,‚Äù Hutchinson told GMA.  On Wednesday, Hutchinson filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Komoroski and several local bars and restaurants where she had allegedly been drinking before driving. He is also suing Komoroski‚Äôs employer and supervisor, accusing them of pressuring her to consume excessive amounts of alcohol. In a statement to ABC, her employer said Komoroski had just started training and ‚Äúthere was no officially organized employee function around drinking‚Äù.  Komoroski has been charged with reckless homicide and three DUIs. She faces up to 25 years in prison for each DUI. Her attorneys have urged the public ‚Äúnot to rush to judgment‚Äù.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS91cy1uZXdzLzIwMjMvbWF5LzE5L2JyaWRlLWtpbGxlZC13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LWdyb29tLXJlYWN0aW9u0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VzLW5ld3MvMjAyMy9tYXkvMTkvYnJpZGUta2lsbGVkLXdlZGRpbmctbmlnaHQtZ3Jvb20tcmVhY3Rpb24?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

On May 14, TikToker Madison Mulkey (whose username is fittingly @brideisapersonality), posted a video that has ignited a debate on wedding fare and staff compensation. In it, Mulkey explains how she pulled off major savings on her Savannah, Georgia wedding by catering the reception with takeout from Chili‚Äôs.  ‚ÄúWe served Chili‚Äôs at our wedding and this is how much we spent,‚Äù Mulkey begins the video, which has garnered more than 1.5 million views. ‚ÄúOur total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests.‚Äù  Get Tri-state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox. Sign up for NBC New York newsletters.  Mulkey says the order included gluten- and dairy-free specialty meals, and accomodated folks who had special requests, like a preference for seafood and more.  ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs talk about what went into serving Chili‚Äôs at our wedding,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFirst of all, we loved the price point, I mean, really can‚Äôt beat that price point. ... It‚Äôs insane that we only spent that much money for our wedding food.‚Äù  Mulvey then explains that her wedding party had to do a ‚Äúlot of work on the back end‚Äù that they didn‚Äôt expect, including picking the food up at 11 a.m. when the reception was at 6 p.m. because they didn‚Äôt want to pay for delivery fees on the day of the event, which happened to coincide with St. Patrick‚Äôs Day.  Mulvey says an aunt who works in food service was tapped to handle transport and set the food up, writing sticky notes showing staff how to cook things appropriately so no one got sick. ‚ÄúNormally, when you order from Chili‚Äôs, they deliver it ‚Ä¶ they set it all up. It‚Äôs already made, people can just serve,‚Äù she says, adding that because of this, they had to figure out how to keep the food fresh until serving time.  ‚ÄúWe had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking, and my coordinator kind of had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn‚Äôt really supposed to do and they weren‚Äôt supposed to do either,‚Äù Mulvey says. ‚ÄúBut everyone made it work.‚Äù  Mulvey ends her video by noting that her situation was rare.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure if you order from Chili‚Äôs in any other regard, like, they would serve it and it would all be so hassle-free,‚Äù Mulvey says, adding that she and her guests thought the food was amazing, listing chicken tender sliders, egg rolls, chips and salsa, Cajun chicken pasta and salad as items on the menu. ‚ÄúI mean, it was the perfect meal for our wedding. I‚Äôm so happy we chose Chili‚Äôs. So happy we did this!‚Äù  Mulkey did not immediately respond to TODAY.com‚Äôs request for comment.  While some of the comments for her video were supportive, many others contained follow-up questions.  ‚ÄúNormalize this! Weddings are so out of control. Such a great idea!‚Äù wrote one TikTok user.  ‚ÄúMy sister got married in March and spent like $10,000 on the food and it suckkkkeddd lmao should‚Äôve gotten chilis,‚Äù another person wrote, to which Mulvey replied, ‚ÄúWedding food is so expensive!‚Äù  ‚ÄúMichael Scott type wedding catering,‚Äù another commented, referencing the famous ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù character who has a somewhat populist approach to food.  ‚ÄúAll I can think abt is how stressful this must have been for the staff,‚Äù one TikTok user noted.  ‚ÄúI would cry if I came into work as a to go specialist and had this to do along with the rest of my orders. AND WITH NO TIP,‚Äù wrote another.  ‚ÄúI hope you generously tipped your servers for the extra unplanned work & got a nice gift for your aunt!‚Äù a TikToker commented, to which another replied, ‚ÄúConsidering they weren‚Äôt willing to pay $300 for delivery and didn‚Äôt tip the staff at chilis I doubt it!‚Äù  ‚ÄúPlease tell me you tipped,‚Äù commented someone else.  So many folks asked about whether or not Mulvey tipped her staff for the unexpected extra work that she uploaded a follow-up video a day later responding to their concerns.  ‚ÄúThis video gained a lot of traction, which means it gained a lot of misunderstanding, which is fine, I can‚Äôt correct and reply to every comment. But here are a few things I want to say,‚Äù Mulvey says in the TikTok.  ‚ÄúWe tipped everyone ‚Äî we tipped the Chili‚Äôs kitchen staff $300, we tipped the Chili‚Äôs manager who worked specifically with us to make sure this was even possible $100,‚Äù she continues, claiming that she tipped her coordinator and servers in addition to paying them a ‚Äúhefty‚Äù hourly fee.  Chili's did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ‚ÄúWe really felt it was important to make sure that we were compensating everyone for their help, their work, the time that they spent doing their job, the work that they had to do at the wedding,‚Äù she says.  Mulvey ends her update by reiterating that the staff didn‚Äôt have to set everything up, but make the food, help the buffet run efficiently and then clean up.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask anyone to work outside of their bounds or their means,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe were really respectful with everyone who was a part of our wedding day.‚Äù  Even with the update, TikTok commenters had even more questions, some which the bride responded to.  ‚ÄúGenuinely curious here, after paying the extra for people helping out‚Ä¶ Would it have been cheaper to have Chili‚Äôs deliver it after all?‚Äù asked one commenter.  ‚ÄúGirl why are you back tracking, you already said in comments that you didn‚Äôt tip lol,‚Äù wrote another. Some viewers alleged she deleted a comment on the original video saying she hadn't tipped.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm snitching ‚Ä¶. Chilis managers aren‚Äôt allowed to get tips,‚Äù another user claimed, to which Mulvey responded, ‚ÄúMaybe they didn‚Äôt take it, I have no idea what they did with it. We gave chilis a lump sum.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uYmNuZXd5b3JrLmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsLWludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvYnJpZGUtc2VydmVkLWNoaWxpcy1hdC1oZXItd2VkZGluZy1hbmQtcGVvcGxlLWhhdmUtbWl4ZWQtZmVlbGluZ3MtYWJvdXQtaXQvNDM0OTk5My_SAZABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3eW9yay5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC1pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsL2JyaWRlLXNlcnZlZC1jaGlsaXMtYXQtaGVyLXdlZGRpbmctYW5kLXBlb3BsZS1oYXZlLW1peGVkLWZlZWxpbmdzLWFib3V0LWl0LzQzNDk5OTMvP2FtcD0x?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This bride-to-be learnt about a devastating secret that her fianc√© and her sister had been keeping from her just a few weeks before her wedding day.  A 28-year-old woman, who is engaged to her 36-year-old fianc√© (D), took to Reddit to share the secret that has in fact caused her to break off the wedding. ‚ÄúAfter a family dinner this weekend, my sister, K who's 32 years old, suggested the two of us go out for some dessert alone. It was a strange suggestion for her to make as we were never really close, but I agreed. However, she simply drove us to a nearby park, where she dropped the bombshell on me that she and D went out for a while,‚Äù shares the bride-to-be. She does, however, add that this had happened before she ever met her fianc√© .  ‚ÄúThey went on dates for about a month but it fizzled out, and she repeatedly reassured me that nothing happened between her and D for the two years D and I were together. ‚ÄúAlso, according to her, after I introduced D to my entire family (about three months into our relationship), she had a discussion with D, hoping D would break it off with me himself. However, D convinced her to simply hide it, as he was happy with me and their short fling shouldn‚Äôt interfere with our relationship,‚Äù she adds. The bride-to-be shared that she felt disgusted and betrayed.  ‚ÄúMy sister is very non-confrontational and I can understand why she wouldn‚Äôt want to be the one to tell me, but I‚Äôve been with D for over two years, and lived with him for almost a whole year. ‚ÄúWhen we got home, I blew up at him in front of our families, for having kept such a large secret from me and broke off the wedding.

""She called the day after our wedding while we were leaving the house for an overnight flight to Italy and asked how she could help. We said one task we have been avoiding is swapping out all the old plates and bowls for new plates and bowls, and maybe swapping out the old toaster for the new toaster.

Now I don't even want to be in my kitchen. I can't find anything and the process of looking usually leads to finding out they moved or threw away something important to me."" The woman added that she now feels ""depressed"" whenever she looks at her kitchen and feels stressed at the thought of having to write thank you cards for presents she didn't even get to open herself. Commenters on the post were sympathetic toward the woman, with many urging her to cut all contact with her mother-in-law if she refuses to apologise for overstepping. One person said: ""This is so heartbreaking! They absolutely need to apologise - genuinely. They need to feel remorse for what they did. Even then it won't be good enough. It just won't. Change the locks. Don't let them come over for a long, long time."" While another added: ""I would NEVER speak with her again or let her in our house. This was your house, your stuff, your space.

It is almost exactly five years since they tied the knot in a fairytale wedding at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Since then, their lives have taken a very different path from what would have been expected - with the couple quitting royal life for California while Harry is barely on speaking terms with his older brother Prince William.  It was on the wedding day on May 19, 2018, that William stood by his brother's side as he welcomed bride Meghan down the aisle before saying 'I do'.

In his memoir Spare, Harry recalls having drinks with friends at Coworth Park Hotel, where he stayed the night before his big day at Windsor Castle.  He claimed William, who had just become a dad for the third time, had been due to join them but he cancelled at the ""last minute"" citing ""Kate and the kids"".  Image: AFP/Getty Images) AFP/Getty Images)  He then goes on to say that he reminded William that it was their tradition as the night before the now Prince of Wales's wedding, the pair had dinner together ahead of greeting the crowds.  Harry claims William asked: ""Why are you even saying hello to the crowds, Harold?""  To which Harry in response admitted in the book: ""I felt sick about it.""  Image: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)  However, Harry did concede that William eventually changed his mind about greeting the crowds and did agree to join his brother, as the Duke of Sussex wondered: ""Maybe Granny intervened"".  Harry says he pressed William about having dinner together and staying the night - and eventually, he relented and agreed to dinner, but wouldn't be staying over, reportedly telling his brother ""Sorry, Harold. Can't. Kids.""  It's unknown how Harry and Meghan will exactly be celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary tomorrow.  The traditional gift to give for five years of marriage is wood, so it's a possibility that the couple will exchange gifts made from the material on Friday.  It is also likely they will be marking the day privately, probably with their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.  Prince Harry's memoir Spare became the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever when his tell-all tale criticising the royal family was finally published earlier this year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFscy9wcmluY2UtaGFycnktZmVsdC1zaWNrLXByaW5jZS0zMDAxNDk4MNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFscy9wcmluY2UtaGFycnktZmVsdC1zaWNrLXByaW5jZS0zMDAxNDk4MC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Georgina Mitchell, 33, claims that the ""negative and unfair"" word - meaning a woman to be wed who becomes unpleasant to deal with - is being phased out.  Instead, the term is being replaced by ""main character bride"" - a much more positive figure, Georgina says. The wedding planner, who has been in the business for 12 years and got married herself last year, added: ""It's like that nightmare employee has become the boss and all is well.  ""Bridezilla is such a negative and unfair term. It was basically about brides crying out to be heard because it's their special day. But they were so disempowered by other people paying - like gifts with strings attached.  ""If we go right back then women were moving families - the passive bride who was given away. That evolved into bridezilla, it was her big day but she didn't own it.  ""Now brides are the main character. They pay for the wedding and can have what they want without a fight. I call her the main character bride. She‚Äôs basically, 'This is what we‚Äôre doing - come if you want. She's only answerable to her partner.""  Georgina gives daily tips on Instagram and TikTok and hosts a wedding-themed podcast. She says the cost of a big day has risen in recent years, with the price of a photographer more than doubling - as people want social media ready content.  But modern weddings are generally smaller and more often held outside, she added. There has also a shift away from the groom's side and the bride's side as modern families are structured differently, Georgina said.  Brides are also opting for two dresses now - the long train in the day then often changing into a short, party dress for the evening. And food is no longer a sitdown, served meal, but more likely street food vans, and pie and mash is a popular option, she said.  ""Weddings are a lot more informal now,"" she went on. ""Couples just want their friends and families to come along and have a good time. Social media has generated a lot of the change I think.  ""Now people use it to get ideas, and they realise they're not alone when they want to go for a non-traditional option. The cost of photographers is eye-watering now. I'd say around ¬£2,000 on average.  ""The biggest change is that couples are doing it their way because they don't feel beholden to anyone else. They can pay for it themselves so they can do what they like.  ""I‚Äôve known a couple to be given ¬£20,000 for their wedding but it came with so many stipulations that they gave it back. They were told who to invite, what kind of wedding to have, what the colour scheme would be.  Georgina and husband Brian, 33, a personal finance influencer, had their legal wedding at a registry office two weeks before another ceremony and party on New Year's Eve. Her dress was fitted with a long train, and there was no cake - instead guests got to make their own cocktails.  Georgina worked on weddings in her roles at a golf club, a hotel, and with an outdoor catering company before setting up her own business, Georgina Rose Events in Gloucester in 2020.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLXdvcmxkLW5ld3Mvd2VkZGluZy1leHBlcnQtc2F5cy10ZXJtLWJyaWRlemlsbGEtODQ0OTI5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Customer orders have been plunged into chaos since the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.  Despite the firm's initial promise that it would find an 'alternative platform' for registries, families say they are none the wiser about what is happening with their gifts.  It means many can no longer access their wishlist - and some have even lost money due to the glitch.  Mom-to-be Jessica Ferrara is celebrating her baby shower on Saturday and guests are now unable to view her registry data.  Even if they could view it, every item is out of stock or discontinued.  On top of that, Ferrara and her partner lost $1,000 on purchases they made themselves such as a crib that converts into a toddler bed and items needed to turn a dresser into a changing table.  Before the purchases arrived, the site said they were out of stock. Customer service has yet to offer her a refund.  The 36-year-old told the Philadelphia Inquirer: 'Your third trimester you‚Äôre supposed to be enjoying it and nesting.  'There certainly hasn‚Äôt been any nesting going on.'  Similarly, bride-to-be CC Manstrom said she has watched the majority of the 30 items on her registry become unavailable.  She is now worried that several people will buy her the same limited gifts which are available.  The retailer has also stopped honoring credits - meaning Manstrom lost out on the $60 that had been put into her account for gifts which were purchased but not available.  She hasn't been able to speak to a customer service representative on the phone.  'It is frustrating. It‚Äôs a new task you have to deal with on the wedding checklist,' Manstrom told the New York Times.  Meanwhile, Amy Tamayo wrote on TikTok: 'When you find out that none of your wedding registry orders were fulfilled & BBB gave you store credit without telling you.'  After initially announcing the bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would partner with another platform where couples could transfer their existing data.  It said it would share the information 'within days.'  But more than two weeks on, no announcement has been made.  Mom-to-be Jessica Ferrara, pictured, is celebrating her baby shower on Saturday and guests are now unable to view her registry  Customer orders have been plunged into chaos since the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April  A note on the retailer's website still reads: 'Customers‚Äô registry data is important to us.

In the meantime, several companies are attempting to swoop in on frustrated customers.  Etsy claims thousands of shoppers have signed up to its wedding registry after launching the new service on May 10.  And Zola, an online registry, told the New York Times it had received 'several hundred emails' from couples asking to transfer their Bed Bath & beyond registries.  The chain is one of several bricks-and-mortar stores to fall victim to the so-called 'retail apocalypse.'  The store's official closing down sales began on April 26.

"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Brits"", ""NorthWest"", ""SouthAfrica""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:07:00","There are lots of different thoughts and opinions on wedding planning etiquette (Picture: Getty)  Weddings are a wonderful celebration of love but they can also cause more than their fair share of drama - especially when there's tricky social dynamics or finances to navigate.  Our advice to brides and grooms-to-be? Offer plus ones if you can.  Almost half (49%) of Brits said they would be bothered if they didn't get a plus one to a wedding, according to a survey of more than 2,000 Brits by wedding supplier Ginger Ray, shared exclusively with Metro.co.uk.  In fact, people feel so passionately about this issue that 10% would go as far as decline an invite altogether if they didn't get a plus one.  High costs of weddings can also divide the crowds. A third of wedding guests (34%) think those tying the knot should pay for guest accommodation. And interestingly, those who earn more expect more.  Nearly half of Brits with a salary of ¬£55,000 per year or more said they would be bothered if their accommodation wasn't paid for, compared to just 31% of those who earn ¬£15,000 or less a year.  You'll also want to keep the purse strings of bridesmaids and groomsmen in mind, as 63% of Brits said it was acceptable to decline an invitation to be in the wedding party because of the costs and responsibilities associated with it.  One in six Brits would skip a wedding altogether to save money (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  But on the plus side, only a third of people believe the couple should cover every cost for the wedding party and over half (54%) said they shouldn‚Äôt pay - so if you need to ask your bridesmaid's to pay for their dresses, it won't come as a surprise to most.  Separate research by jeweller F. Hinds backed up that money is a real sticking point for guests.  Around third of the 2,000 surveyed said they would skip part of a wedding to save money. One in five would skip the reception and just attend the ceremony while 16% would skip the nuptials and head for the party.  With Brits spending an average of ¬£604 to attend each wedding, one in six Brits claimed they would decline the invite altogether in a bid to save some cash.  Then you've got the cost of destination weddings which, while they look great on the Instagram, can burn a hole in your pocket.  Top ways guests would choose to save money attending a wedding: Wearing something they already own to save on a new outfit - 42% Not attending the hen or stag do - 25% Spending less on a wedding gift for the couple - 23% Booking cheap accommodation - 22% Driving to the venue to avoid getting a taxi - 20% Only attending the wedding ceremony - 18% Declining the wedding invitation - 17% Only attending the wedding reception - 16% Sharing travel or accommodation with other guests - 15% Not drinking at the reception - 12%  When it comes to children-free weddings, things can sometimes get pretty heated between the future married couple and guests who have young kids.  But interestingly, the Ginger Ray survey found over half of Brits said they wouldn't be bothered if their kids weren't invited to the wedding and only 9% wouldn't attend as a result. Maybe it would be a welcome break to have a little adult time.  About 16% of Brits would skip the wedding ceremony and attend the reception (Picture: Getty Images)  How to avoid these wedding mishaps  Ginger Ray's wedding planning expert Jess Martin shared her advice for navigating some common, tricky situations during wedding season.    Declining an invite due to finances  'The way you go about it is what really matters, and if someone loves you enough to have invited you to be in their wedding, then they will completely understand the reasons why you can‚Äôt accept.  Budgeting as a guest/bridesmaid/groomsman  'Questions like: ""I‚Äôm trying to budget for your big day, can you let me know what things I will need to pay for myself so I can plan for it?"" or ""So I know how much to budget for, can you let me know what you will be paying for and what I‚Äôll need to pay for myself?""  'This shows the couple you‚Äôre aware there will be additional costs, but leaves the onus on them to explain what costs you might incur as part of the wedding party.  Telling guests they DO NOT have a plus one  'The best way to avoid this question is to make it really clear on your wedding invitations who the invite is for, specifically.  'I‚Äôd go so far as to write on the invitations something like: ""no additional guest invited"" or ""no +1 allowed"" or ""this invite is for Jane and Jane only"" to just make your point totally clear!  'Whether you don‚Äôt want a plus one from a financial perspective, from a capacity point of view, or because you simply do not want people you don‚Äôt know at your wedding, it‚Äôs your wedding and your rules!'  'If it bothers your guests so much that they cannot bring another person to the wedding of one of their friends, then perhaps they shouldn‚Äôt come at all.'  At the end of the day it's your wedding and your rules (within reason) (Picture: Getty Images)  Making sure there's no surprise little guests  'The best way to make the point clear, is again to make sure it‚Äôs written in the invitations. Including the message ""this wedding is for adults only"" or ""please note: children are not invited on this occasion"" are simple disclaimers that get the point across in a clear and concise way.  'If after that you still are asked the question, all you need to do is respond with: ""as mentioned in the invitations, we have decided to make our wedding day an adults-only event, and there will not be any facilities or catering options for children. We‚Äôre really sorry if this means you can‚Äôt make the wedding, but we totally understand!""'  Telling family they'll have to pay for their own accomodation  'Most people won‚Äôt expect you to pay for accommodation as just a guest. However, clarity is key when it comes to family members and those in the wedding party.  'Let them know as soon as possible whether they will need to find and book their own place to stay.  'In your wedding invitations or save the dates, it can be nice to include a list of suggested accommodation options. It also serves as a handy hint that people will need to find and book their own.  'If you are lucky enough to have some rooms available for guests to stay in at your venue, make it very clear who is staying where otherwise people may automatically presume they can stay and let people know as soon as possible.'

Upset over the Church‚Äôs indifference, the bridegroom is now slated to move a contempt of court petition in the High Court against the Knanaya Church.  The 31-year-old bridegroom, a member of St. Anne‚Äôs Church, Kottody, in Kasaragod under the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam, was slated to marry Vijimol, a member of St Xavier‚Äôs Church, Kottody, under the Thalassery archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church.  Also Read | A wedding could script history for Knanaya Catholic Church  Although he was entitled to get a consent or Vivaha Kuri from his church as per a High Court order, he was denied the same at the last minute citing the absence of an application. As the marriage sacrament could not be completed, the bridegroom and bride exchanged garlands at a brief function held outside St Xavier‚Äôs Church.  ‚ÄúHaving completed all the stipulations for marrying a woman such as attending the pre-marriage course and making confession, there is no reason why the Church should deny me the consent,‚Äù Mr. John said. The marriage, according to him, was scheduled to be organised at the bride‚Äôs parish to avoid a possible law and order situation at his own parish.  Meanwhile, the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samiti, a reformation group that leads legal battle to end the practice of endogamy in the Knanaya Church, will also file a contempt of court case in the High Court against the denial of Vivaha Kuri to Mr. John.  The Knanaya Archeparchy, on its part, clarified that the bridegroom had failed to submit relevant documents and complete procedures for his marriage. ‚ÄúHe approached the parish for a consent only on the eve of his wedding. We need to complete the canonical procedure before issuing the consent for the marriage,‚Äù said Fr. Michael Vettikkatt, spokesperson of the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam.  As to a query whether the membership of Mr. John with the Knanaya Archeparchy stood cancelled with the wedding, Fr.

"wedding","2023-09-01","19:00:00","{""Bundaberg"", ""Queensland"", ""Australia""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:44:00","A bride's decision not to cover the expenses of her deaf sister's Auslan sign language interpreters for the wedding reception has ignited a social media debate, raising questions surrounding bridal etiquette and shedding light on the broader, significant issues faced by the Deaf community.  The predicament was explained in a post originally shared on Facebook, which later sparked discussion on the social media site Reddit.  ""Looking for advice here. I have my half sister's wedding in September this year. My whole family are hearing, I'm the only one Deaf and use Auslan,"" the original post explained.  A bride's refusal to cover the cost of her Deaf sister's interpreter's meals at the wedding reception has ignited a debate. Image: Getty Creative  ""My sister is refusing to pay and accomodate for 2 Auslan interpreters to be at the wedding reception. I will be paying the Auslan interpreters with my NDIS funding of course but should I be out of pocket for their meals?""  'Feeding them is the least she could do'  Members of a popular Reddit community dedicated to exposing shameful wedding planning practices wasted no time in weighing in on the subject.  ""I would skip the wedding if they are not willing to provide meals to the interpreters,"" voiced one individual, while another emphasised the importance of considering the deaf sister's needs. ""This person invited someone who is Deaf. It's not like the sister doesn't know she needs an interpreter to be comfortable at the wedding. Feeding them is the least she could do. She should have planned her wedding knowing this was going to be a cost.""  RELATED:  Echoing these sentiments, another member, who said they had Deaf family members, affirmed the importance of accommodating interpreters. ""My parents are Deaf and every wedding/funeral/formal event has had interpreting accomodations made by whoever planned the event, my parents don't even ask because it's a known need within my family.""  Story continues  Other group members concurred, with one describing the cost of two extra meals as a ""nominal cost"" and negligible in the overall context of a wedding, especially considering the financial burden the Deaf person already faces in hiring interpreters for the event.  Redditors were divided on the topic. Photo: Facebook  ""The bride should 100% be paying for their meals for them. I can't believe that is even a suggestion that she wouldn't.""  Adding to the discussion, a wedding photographer chuckled, ""you‚Äôd be amazed the lengths some couples go to in order to save $45 on their $17K wedding. It‚Äôs insane.""  On the other hand  However, not everyone thought the bride should shoulder the cost of the interpreters' meals at the wedding reception.  ""I would offer to pay for the meals of my own interpreters,"" one person told the group, ""I would expect my half-sister to accommodate my interpreters at my table, but I would gladly offer to pay for their meals.""  ""I‚Äôm actually really torn,"" said another ""I kind of side with the bride, here. She should absolutely accommodate them by welcoming them, making space for them at the table, seating chart, etc. but I definitely don‚Äôt think the bride needs to pay them for their services.""  The discussion surrounding the issue went on to raise broader questions regarding the lack of sign language knowledge within families and significant issues faced by the Deaf community.  ""I'm confused as to why she needs an interpreter,"" someone stated. ""Why hasn't her family learned sign language?

The bride is the daughter of Yashpal Benam from the Pauri region in Uttarakhand. The leader is drawing criticism from the masses as his daughter is marrying a Muslim man.  The photo of the card has gained traction on social media, with both supporters and opponents of the BJP criticising Benam.  advertisement  While Hindutva hardliners are trolling the former MLA and the saffron party alleging ‚Äúdouble standards"", others are calling the marriage an attempt of ""Love Jihad"", comparing it with the recently released controversial movie The Kerala Stories.  ‚ÄúThe BJP-ruled states are making films like ‚ÄòThe Kerala Story‚Äô tax-free while here a BJP leader‚Äôs daughter is marrying a Muslim man. These are double standards of the BJP and party workers will get demoralised,‚Äù said a Facebook user.  ‚ÄúLove jihad‚Äù is a term often used by BJP leaders as well as right-wing activists to allege a ploy by Muslim men to lure Hindu women into religious conversion through marriage.  ALSO READ |'The Kerala Story' contains hate speech, based on manipulated facts: Bengal defends ban in SC  Speaking to India Today, officials from the Pauri Temple Committee said, ""It is a matter of concern. Getting daughters of Hindu families married to men from other religions is a part of propaganda.

Still, BJP's own leaders are getting their daughters married to a Muslim man,"" one of the committee members said.

The wedding is slated to take place at a resort in Pauri on May 28. Benam is the chairman of the Pauri Municipal Corporation.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Jaipur"", ""Rajasthan"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:34:01","It is understandable why destination weddings have grown in popularity in India in recent years. They not only give the couple and their guests a special experience, but they also give people a chance to travel to new and intriguing places in the nation. But as times have changed, more and more couples are choosing destination weddings, where they can say their vows in front of beautiful settings while being joined by family and friends.  However, it‚Äôs not just about ‚Äòdestination weddings‚Äô anymore. The latest trend to hit the marriage market is ‚ÄòVicination Weddings‚Äô - destination weddings held near to or in the same area as the couple‚Äôs or their families‚Äô primary residence.  Couples are opting to say their vows at close locations instead of travelling to a distant location because they provide a special and intimate experience for everyone involved. Tourist destinations close to Tier-1 and Metro cities are becoming more popular as a result of this trend. In the north are Jaipur, Udaipur, Mussoorie, Agra, and Lonavala, while in the south are Coorg, Ooty, Mahabalipuram, and Puducherry.  Vicination weddings are gaining popularity for multiple reasons, including the ease of travel, familiarity of the place as they enjoyed a change of scene from a typical wedding. The couples and the family also get to imbibe some local feel to the D-Day.    ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãConvenience  Vicination weddings are becoming increasingly popular in India due to the convenience factor they offer. By having the wedding in a nearby location, the couple can save on travel costs and minimise the amount of planning and coordination required. Moreover, guests who may have busy schedules or other commitments can attend the wedding without having to take too much time off work or away from their families.    Promote culture & tradition  Weddings in the vicinity offer the chance to showcase the local culture and traditions. The wedding venue and decor can incorporate local elements and traditions, giving the wedding a unique and authentic feel. Moreover, by supporting local vendors and businesses, the wedding can contribute to the local economy and community.    The difference  While vicination weddings can be a sought-after option for people not willing to go far for a wedding, there is a fair chance of missing out on some fun of a destination wedding. If the location is familiar to the guests and the couple, it may not offer the same level of novelty or adventure as a destination wedding.  For couples who wish to commemorate their special day without the added hassle and expense of travelling far away, vicination weddings are a sensible and handy choice.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Goshen"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:29:43","A 77-year-old woman from Ohio has fulfilled her lifelong dream ‚Äì to marry herself.  Dorothy ‚ÄúDottie‚Äù Fideli celebrated her love for herself during a wedding ceremony at her retirement home on Saturday 13 May. The mother of three and grandmother was married once in 1965, but the marriage ended after nine years. Now, after 40 years of being single, she‚Äôs finally performed the ultimate act of self love.  ‚ÄúThis is something I‚Äôve always wanted,‚Äù Fideli told NBC affiliate WLWT5. ‚ÄúI wanted to get married and have a happy life but things didn‚Äôt work out that way and now I have a second chance in doing something that‚Äôll make me happy.‚Äù  The wedding, which took place at O‚ÄôBannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, was an emotional and symbolic ceremony surrounded by family and friends. Fideli initially got the idea to marry herself from her neighbours, who had heard about a woman doing something similar on a talk show, WLWT5 reported.  ‚ÄúI do some crazy things around here just to make people laugh,‚Äù she said in an interview with Today. ‚ÄúWhen I see them all down in the dumps, I go get one of my outfits on and dress up and come down, and they smile.‚Äù  But on Saturday, Fideli‚Äôs plan to uplift the residents of the retirement home turned out to be an emotional and symbolic ceremony.  For her first wedding in 1965, Fideli and her ex-husband quickly exchanged vows at a courthouse, but ‚Äúhe went to work and I went home‚Äù right after the ceremony. ‚ÄúI wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,‚Äù she jokingly told Today. Fideli added that she always wished she could have had a ‚Äúbig wedding‚Äù, but had thought it was ‚Äútoo late‚Äù for her.  It‚Äôs because of her daughter, Donna Pennington, that Fideli‚Äôs dreams came true. Her daughter did all the cooking for the big day, and decorated the retirement home‚Äôs community room with balloons. Fideli wore a white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt, as well as a white veil with an embellished headband.  Story continues  ‚ÄúI told my daughter, I said, ‚ÄòThis is the best thing that I‚Äôve ever had, outside of having you kids,‚Äô‚Äù Fideli told Today. ‚Äú‚ÄòThis is what I‚Äôve always wanted and I‚Äôm so happy that you [gave] it to me.‚Äô‚Äù  Like any bride, the 77-year-old was ‚Äúnervous‚Äù leading up to the wedding but was ultimately ‚Äúreally happy‚Äù when she married herself. During the ceremony, which was officiated by the retirement home‚Äôs property manager, Fideli held a white lily in her hand as a symbol for self-love, according to Today.  ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòEverybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they‚Äôre happy and everything‚Äôs going to be hunky-dory, but they don‚Äôt consider the inside, the little petals inside,‚Äô‚Äù she recalled.  ‚Äú‚ÄòThe inside is what‚Äôs important. That‚Äôs where God‚Äôs love flows,‚Äô‚Äù Fideli continued. ‚Äú‚ÄòThat‚Äôs where he gives you wisdom and he gives you hope. And nobody ever takes time to think about that. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve done, and I‚Äôd appreciate it if all of you people would do it and think of it that way.‚Äô‚Äù  After dedicating much of her time towards raising her family, Fideli said she‚Äôs ‚Äúat the point‚Äù in my life‚Äù where it‚Äôs ‚Äúmy turn to do what I want to do‚Äù.  ‚ÄúLove, love is the most important thing in this world, and if you love God and love yourself, this world will be a field of roses,‚Äù Fideli told WLWT5, adding that she hopes her story inspires others to find their own self-love.  ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs not in the cards for them, then there‚Äôs something out there that will make them happy and find themselves in life and fulfil their soul.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZWxkZXJseS13b21hbi1tYXJyaWVzLWhlcnNlbGYtYWdlLTA5Mjk0MzA1NC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2VsZGVybHktd29tYW4tbWFycmllcy1oZXJzZWxmLWFnZS0wOTI5NDMwNTQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:56:23","A woman looking for advice on what to wear to a friend‚Äôs wedding sparked a spirited debate about what makes a dress too similar to a wedding gown.  The woman, who goes by the Reddit user name u/phonate, shared a picture of her initial look in the popular forum r/Weddingattireapproval, asking: ‚ÄúFloral formal for late summer/early fall wedding by the sea Suggestions welcomed??‚Äù  The picture in the post showcased a tan lace dress with a deep V neckline and ruffled skirt, its entirety adorned with multi-coloured flowers. The outfit is currently being sold by designer fashion brand Teuta Matoshi for $749.  In the caption, the Reddit user described the dress code of the wedding and the itinerary for the event.  ‚ÄúColourful formal with a floral twist‚Ä¶interesting patterns and prints, high-hats, scarves, oversized jackets, favourite dress,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúWedding ceremony by the ocean, followed by dinner reception and party. The setting of the party is a micro-village with festivities shifting between our garden, adjacent the ocean and at our house.‚Äù  She noted that while she thought the lace midi-dress would be a good fit, she thought that other people in the Reddit forum may have ‚Äúbetter ideas‚Äù for her.  As of 18 May, the post has more than 2,200 upvotes, with fellow Reddit users expressing that the outfit looks too similar to the style of a wedding gown and encouraging her to find a new one.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty but find it in a different colour, I‚Äôve seen bridal gowns that look just like this,‚Äù one wrote.  ‚ÄúI had to check and make sure this wasn‚Äôt a bride asking for opinions on her wedding gown. Sooo, probably not a good choice,‚Äù  A third shared: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs too light. I just saw a wedding dress that looked almost identical, Teuta Matoshi has a million different colours. I think green would be nice.‚Äù  However, other people felt like it was a good fit for the occasion given its dress code.  ‚ÄúI love this super specific theme tbh,‚Äù one wrote. ‚ÄúLove this dress + matches the theme perfectly!‚Äù  Story continues  ‚ÄúI say WEAR IT!!! ITS FREAKING GORGEOUS,‚Äù another wrote, while a third added: ‚ÄúI think it works, especially because it‚Äôs tea-length and not white.‚Äù  The wedding guest later gave an update on the situation and revealed that the bride told her not to wear this gown, writing: ‚ÄúChecked with the bride and this dress is cancelled. Seeking recommendations for alternatives!‚Äù  It‚Äôs a general rule of thumb that guests should not wear white to someone‚Äôs wedding. With that in mind, wedding dress designer Madeline Gardner also told The Knot that there are some dress colours that guests should avoid.  ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre a guest at a wedding, the most important thing to keep in mind is not to upstage or upset the bride,‚Äù Gardner said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe to stay away from any outfits that are predominantly white, cream or ivory.‚Äù  This is far from the first time a wedding guest‚Äôs outfit has sparked an etiquette debate. Earlier this week, Olivia Wilde was met with mixed reactions when she wore a backless white gown to Colton Underwood‚Äôs wedding to Jordan C Brown.  ‚ÄúWore a wedding dress to a wedding just so I could make a joke about it in my toast,‚Äù Wilde captioned a since-expired photo of herself wearing the dress and holding a white parasol at the ceremony on her Instagram Stories.

"wedding","2023-05-01","19:00:00","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:07:30","[This story contains spoilers to the season 19 two-episode finale of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, ‚ÄúWedding Bell Blues/Happily Ever After.‚Äù]  The two-hour conclusion to Grey‚Äôs Anatomy‚Äôs 19th season welcomed back two of its recently departed doctors, and left another character‚Äôs fate up in the air.  After exiting the hit ABC medical drama as a series regular earlier in the season, Ellen Pompeo made her anticipated return during the May 18 two-part finale, ‚ÄúWedding Bell Blues/Happily Ever After.‚Äù The episode split its time between the veteran cast and the younger batch of interns, with the main storyline centering around Simone‚Äôs (Alexis Floy) wedding day and the young doctor ultimately calling off her nuptials and choosing Lucas (Niko Terho). With the wedding as the backdrop, love was in the air for many of the characters ‚Äî including Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Link (Chris Carmack), who finally vocalized their love for one another.  And both Meredith (Pompeo) and Maggie (Kelly McCreary) ‚Äî after wrapping each of their stories by choosing their own passions over love ‚Äî rekindled their relationships on their own terms in their returns. When a group of the Grey Sloan Memorial doctors fly out to Boston to attend the ceremony for the coveted Catherine Fox Award (where Chandra Wilson‚Äôs Bailey, in a heartfelt moment, received a surprise award for her devotion to reproductive health care after the Supreme Court‚Äôs Dobbs decision), both Nick (Scott Speedman) and Winston (Anthony Hill) got the chance to reunite with their estranged partners. Meredith and Nick last spoke when she pretended to not hear his ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù while she boarded her plane to Boston with her children; and Maggie and husband Winston left their marriage up in the air when she moved to Chicago to pursue her medical ambitions.  Meredith and Nick cleared up a few misunderstandings, mainly that Nick should have never let Meredith walk away. ‚ÄúI want to live a whole life with love, and mess and pain‚Ä¶ and you,‚Äù he told her, to which she replied, ‚ÄúWell, OK, then,‚Äù and they shared a kiss. Meanwhile, Winston finally matched Maggie‚Äôs ambitions and when he did, they agreed to start here and figure out the rest as they embark on a long-distance relationship.  But the episode wasn‚Äôt all about tying things up in neat bows. Meredith, who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer‚Äôs, potentially put her career in jeopardy by making public her new findings, which contradict decades of studies. Webber (James Pickens Jr.) potentially put his sobriety in jeopardy after being rocked by a near-death experience on the flight to Boston. And Teddy (Kim Raver) ends the episode unconscious and on the floor of a surgery room, her fate unclear by the episode‚Äôs end. Teddy, who was recently named Chief, spent the episode complaining of a toothache before falling to the ground in the final moment. (Spoiler alert: Raver has closed her deal to return next season, THR has learned.)  On McCreary‚Äôs part, in a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter about her exit, the actress left the door open to cycle back into the show in the future, similar to exiting stars before her (Kate Walsh appeared in three episodes this season, reprising her Dr. Addison Montgomery). ‚ÄúI love that about the show, that people come back. I think it‚Äôs open. I think that‚Äôs a question for Meg Marinis, who is the new showrunner. But I am open to it and I think the storyline leaves it pretty open,‚Äù she said. Speaking to the finale, she later added to THR, ‚ÄúIt seems like even though she‚Äôs gone to Chicago, Maggie and Winston‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt over. I‚Äôm happy to see there‚Äôs still love, respect ‚Äî and of course a lot of heat between them.‚Äù  The finale also brings an end to Krista Vernoff‚Äôs run as showrunner, as she passes over the reins to Marinis for the 20th season of ABC‚Äôs longest-running primetime scripted series, created by Shonda Rhimes.

The Duchess of Sussex moved her groom to tears in the classic silk gown in pure white, with a 15ft veil embroidered with flowers of the Commonwealth.  The dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, was minimal yet classic, the main focus being the open bateau neckline that gracefully framed the shoulders and sculpted Meghan's waist.  However, another wedding dress would soon be on view that day - five years ago today. And this one wowed the crowds in quite a different way.  For the wedding ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on May 19, 2018, Meghan wore a pure white silk Givenchy dress  The elegant dress by designer Clare Waight Keller had a simple bateau neckline and a long train  As with other royal brides, Meghan changed into a second dress for the evening, this time opting for a bespoke Stella McCartney design  The ceremony had taken place St George's, Windsor, on May 19 2018 in front of 600 guests.  Afterwards, however, 200 of the bride and groom's closest friends and family went on to Frogmore House on the Windsor estate for an evening reception hosted by Prince Charles .  As with other royal brides, Meghan changed into a second dress for the intimate gathering, this time opting for a bespoke Stella McCartney design.  While the first dress was expected to be a 'traditional and elegant' wedding gown, the second was a modest yet more glamorous number.  The slinky evening dress was made from silk crepe and the halter neck gown was pure white just like Meghan's ¬£200,000 Givenchy number for the ceremony.  The backless number allowed the Duchess of Sussex to show off her toned shoulders and back and the figure-hugging gown featured a dramatic fluted skirt.  Meghan paired the evening gown with heels by Aquazurra made in silky satin with nude mesh and soles painted in baby blue.  Meghan wore an aquamarine ring belonging to the late Lady Diana Spencer, thought to have been a sentimental gift from Prince Harry so as to include his mother on the big day.  The evening halter-neck dress was made from silk crepe and the halter neck gown was pure white. Here Meghan and Harry are pictured leaving Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House  The happy newlyweds danced the night away following an outfit change  The low-cut design of the evening gown showed off Meghan's back and shoulders  Meghan shows of an acquamarine ring that had once belonged to her mother-in-law, Diana  Prince Harry also had an outfit change into a sleek dinner suit with black tie as he and Meghan headed to the reception in an ice-blue vintage Jaguar.  Sharing a sketch of the design Meghan wore to the evening reception in 2018, British designer, Stella McCartney said:  'I am so proud and honoured to have been chosen by the Duchess of Sussex to make her evening gown and represent British design.  'It has truly been one of the most humbling moments of my career and I am so proud of all the team on this stunning sunny royal day,' she told fashion magazine Women's Wear Daily.  Many had suspected that Meghan would choose McCartney, given the designer's stance against using fur and leather, as well as her use of organic fabrics - an outlook which fits with Meghan and Harry's eco-friendly principles  Stella McCartney spoke of her pride as she shared a sketch of the evening halter neck gown  Unlike the dress worn during the ceremony, the evening gown had a smaller train and the slinky material meant Meghan and Harry could dance the night away.  Her hair - styled by George Northwood - was up in a tight bun with face-framing layers, which perfectly suited the dress and the less-formal evening occasion.  Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage revealed to Femail that the gown would probably have cost around ¬£80,000 for fabric, design and fittings.  Kate, the Princess of Wales, also wore two wedding dresses on her big day in 2011, which were both designed by Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA1MDI1Ny9NZWdoYW5zLVNFQ09ORC13ZWRkaW5nLWdvd24tZ2xhbW9yb3VzLW51bWJlci1kYW5jZWQtbmlnaHQtYXdheS1IYXJyeS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA1MDI1Ny9hbXAvTWVnaGFucy1TRUNPTkQtd2VkZGluZy1nb3duLWdsYW1vcm91cy1udW1iZXItZGFuY2VkLW5pZ2h0LWF3YXktSGFycnkuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Is there a proper way to notify them of the wedding without inviting them? My brother‚Äôs family and my aunt and uncle all have clear qualms about queer relationships. I think they‚Äôd also be offended not to be invited. I would like to find the most gracious means to handle this.  GENTLE READER: The most gracious thing would be to invite them, as this demonstrates trust that they are fundamentally decent and care about you as a member of their family first, putting any other opinions they may hold second.  But Miss Manners infers that past behaviors have convinced you that such trust would be misplaced, and that they will be unpleasant no matter what you do. Better, then, to omit them from the guest list and leave it at that. They will learn about the nuptials and can gnash their teeth without any action on your part.  DEAR MISS MANNERS: I invited a group to dinner at my home to celebrate the expected return of another friend from a long residence overseas. The guest of honor immediately suggested I change the date to better match the schedule of another guest; I did so.  Then I learned that several of the guests had a private conversation to set up an even better date for all of them as an alternative. I was not privy to this conversation until after they had decided on a new date -- one on which I was not available to attend, much less host. In the meantime, the original invitation was still out there, though I now knew that most of the guests had planned another event. How should I have treated the original invitation?  GENTLE READER: As your guests are likely as confused about the original invitation as Miss Manners, she suggests you call everyone to review the bidding. This will involve another round of calls, but will also give you the opportunity to appear gracious while making it clear that you have been cheated out of your plan.

""It's comforting to know that the person who did this is not out on the streets anymore,"" said Rosie Brustowsky, Schwartz's fiance. ""That doesn't bring him back.""  A suspect has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting earlier this year of a well-known North Miami Beach man a week before he was set to get married. NBC6's Alyssa Hyman reports  Schwartz had been found shot to death inside his car in the parking lot of a Wendy's at 25 Northeast 167 Street on Feb. 19.  At a news conference Thursday, North Miami Beach Police officials said it was a carjacking gone wrong.  Police said fingerprints and ballistic evidence helped link Redmon to the crime.  Schwartz was originally from New York and had lived in South Florida for about 12 years. He was set to get married about a week before his killing.  ""That was supposed to be the most incredible week of my life,"" Brustowsky said. ""And instead we were mourning.""

On the night of April 28, a golf cart carrying four people was struck from behind by an alleged drunk driver near Charleston, South Carolina, killing 34-year-old Samantha Miller and critically injuring her new husband, Aric Hutchinson, and two others.  The couple had just celebrated their wedding earlier that day, ABC News reported previously.  Hutchinson spoke to ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù in his first interview since the tragic accident that killed his wife, sharing how he‚Äôs coping with the immense loss after what he says had been a perfect day.  ‚ÄúShe was so happy. I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful. And she just had a weird, like, calmness that night,‚Äù said Hutchinson, who added that the wedding and the reception were one of the best nights of his life.  According to a GoFundMe set up by Hutchinson‚Äôs mother, Hutchinson broke both legs, parts of his face, and his back, and suffered brain bleeds and numerous cuts in the accident. The two others in the golf cart with Hutchinson and Miller suffered injuries including severe road rash and open wounds, according to Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV.  The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 miles per hour in a 25 miles per hour zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety.

Almost exactly four years later, they took the next big step when Brad got down on one knee in Santorini, Greece.  The duo got right to wedding planning. ‚ÄúWe chose our venue and most vendors in 2018, and it was smooth sailing‚Äîuntil we called it off in April 2020,‚Äù Elizabeth remembers. ‚ÄúThe hardest part of the planning process was postponing our wedding and trusting that things would come together the following year.

When you‚Äôre vowing to be together forever, what‚Äôs another year or three?‚Äù  Timing aside, it was the vision that mattered, and it came together flawlessly. For Elizabeth and Brad, the wedding was more than one day.

""So, I was quite relieved when Brad enthusiastically agreed. San Juan Island is one of my favorite places on earth, and Roche Harbor Resort in particular holds special significance for my family.‚Äù Her family has been visiting there since the 1960s. Now, there was a chance to show off this sliver of the Pacific Northwest to all of their family and friends joining from out of state.  ‚ÄúWe wanted the weekend to feel like an all-inclusive, elevated summer camp experience,‚Äù Elizabeth says. ‚ÄúMany of our guests arrived by seaplane, which set the tone for a unique adventure. We created a calendar of events and wanted each night to feel distinct and slightly more formal than the previous, and provide ample quality time to mix our friend groups.‚Äù Festivities began on Thursday, when the bridal party kicked off the weekend with a luau dinner at Westcott Bay Shellfish Co., complete with lawn games and root beer floats. There was a whale-watching excursion for guests arriving Friday, a welcome dinner, and a send-off brunch on Sunday.  Of course, there was also the main event. ‚ÄúOur Saturday wedding day was a marathon,‚Äù Elizabeth adds.

What starts out as a frivolous romcom about a jealous sibling trying to sabotage her big sister‚Äôs wedding, evolves into light-hearted thriller with ninja ladies flying through the air with Pakistani panache.  ‚ÄúPolite Society‚Äù blends Jane Austen with ‚ÄúHouse of the Flying Daggers.‚Äù  Two sisters pledge to defy arranged marriage and arrange their own lives instead. Young Ria longs to be a stunt woman. Elder sis Lena attends art school.  But when her parents invite a handsome young doctor for dinner, Lena‚Äôs resolve melts.  To Ria‚Äôs disgust, Lena says yes to Salim‚Äôs proposal.  Ninja wannabe Ria gathers her BFFs, Clara and Alba, to concoct a multi-phase scheme to disrupt the marriage by any means necessary ‚Äì up to and including spin kicks in wedding dresses.  Ria‚Äôs inept kung fu moves just add to the fun.  The amusing marital mash up ends in preposterous fashion with a sci-fi twist.  Usually such silliness annoys me, but two qualities saved ‚ÄúPolite Society.‚Äù  First, Nida Manzoor‚Äôs British film about a traditional Pakistani family takes pointed, but loving shots, at the submissive role of women in their culture. Ria and Lena both intend to forge their own path.  All goes well until Lena opts to trade her feminist sensibility for the accoutrements of gold digging.  Outraged, Ria, the kick-ass-sister, pledges to fight the good feminist fight, with BFFs Alba and Clara at her side.  But it‚Äôs the love between sisters that holds ‚ÄúPolite Society‚Äù together.  Ria‚Äôs war against her sister‚Äôs marriage is partly adolescent jealousy (‚ÄúI‚Äôm prettier!‚Äù), but partly separation grief. Ria senses their deep friendship will likely end as sis sells out and moves away.  Ria‚Äôs clumsy kicks hide a broken heart.  The ninja shenanigans that cover up tears are actually quite sweet.  In the end, Ria establishes her own YouTube brand: ‚ÄúI am the fury!‚Äù Bruce Lee beware.  My runner-up in the ‚Äúone liner‚Äù raffle was ‚Äúgive me that womb!‚Äù  That demand refers to Salim‚Äôs secret pursuit of the perfect repository for his perfect sperms.  The title ‚ÄúPolite Society‚Äù is a subversive stab at rules that try to keep young ladies from breaking the glass ceiling. Manzoor‚Äôs script is incisive, clever and outrageous in equal portions.  She‚Äôs blowing up movie norms at the same time she revolts against patriarchal Pakistani values.  So what have we here, anyway?  ‚ÄúPolite Society‚Äù is an irreverent attack on Pakistani patriarchy crafted with love and affection for all ‚Äì and including lots of kung fu action.  ‚ÄúBend it Like Beckham‚Äù has a sequel: Bend it like Ria!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaGVsZW5haXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmx5aW5nLXNpc3RlcnMtc3Bpbi1raWNrcy1pbi13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wODEzNjM1Mi1mNDI4LTExZWQtYWJhMi1lZmE5M2IyNjVjMWMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Besides, he argued, wedding guests come for the ceremony, not the food.  ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt primarily come to eat,‚Äù Fetter argued to the board. The meeting was held in Albany, but could also be viewed online. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the main focus. They go primarily for a wedding.‚Äù  Sign up for the Saratoga Now newsletter Keep up with the latest happening in Saratoga Springs, Clifton Park, Ballston Spa and other communities in Saratoga County. Sign up here.  However, the board dismissed his appeal to keep the wooden pole barn fire-suppression free. They adjourned to discuss the case at a future meeting.  While Chuck Fetter did not immediately return a Times Union phone call on Wednesday, he admitted to the board that his approach to building the venue ‚Äúwas a mistake,‚Äù but ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think it was catastrophic.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good spot for weddings,‚Äù Chuck Fetter told the board.  There are other problems, too ‚Äî mainly noise emanating from Fetters‚Äô Galway Road farm that is upsetting neighbors. Donna Miller said music plays loudly throughout receptions, and many of the events include fireworks.  ‚ÄúI hope they will be conscientious and recognize their neighbors,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs assumed that they would take into consideration what their wedding venue clients are requesting in regards to noise, particularly to take notice if fireworks are to be used.‚Äù  Fireworks require permits, said town Clerk Margaret DeFoe, and she said the couple has never sought a permit for their firework displays.  Noise is the same issue that plagued the neighbors of S&S Saratoga Farm in Saratoga. After a long court battle, the town, which was considering changing the zoning to allow weddings there, finally dropped the idea. Weddings, the town said, were not a permitted use in that area.  Galway resident Tom O‚ÄôBrien said he‚Äôs not happy the Fetters never notified neighbors of their plans. While not completely against a wedding venue there, he has said he is concerned about what could happen next if the town allows Star Farm to build what it wants without oversight.  ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs to say that doesn‚Äôt change to be a brewery or a bar with (Fetter‚Äôs) lack of respect for the town and its regulations,‚Äù O‚ÄôBrien said at a February Town Board meeting. ‚ÄúHow does the town keep people from building anything they want?‚Äù  Some Town Board members also appear concerned. Councilman Fred Arnold said in an April Town Board meeting, minutes show, that Fetter continues ‚Äúto do what he wants‚Äù even with a cease-and-desist order.  Meanwhile, Star Farm Blueberries continues to advertise as a wedding venue, giving its wedding packages as much play as its blueberries on its website.  ‚ÄúThe residents of Galway need to know that there are local laws about construction that are to be adhered to,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúIf not, it will otherwise open the flood gate and people will get away with just constructing anything without permits.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9nYWx3YXktYmx1ZWJlcnJ5LWZhcm0tYnVpbGRzLXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWUtcGVybWl0cy0xODEwMzA1NS5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2022-09-01","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:32:22","Why Philly Bridal Designer Jovan O‚ÄôConnor Wore Three Different Gowns for Her Wedding  Her couture ceremony dress was inspired by Sex and the City.  Delivering the latest in style, inspiration, helpful tips and tricks, and everything else you need to know to plan the perfect Philly wedding.  Remember when we told you bridal designer Jovan O‚ÄôConnor would don two wedding gowns for her Big Day? Well, she ended up sporting three. It‚Äôs not too, too much of a surprise, though. She hinted at a bonus look when we chatted with her shortly before her September 2022 wedding. All of them were fabulous ‚Äî much like Jovan and her groom, whose Morris Arboretum & Gardens wedding was sweet but stylish. Petronella Photography snapped the fashionable festivities below.  It pays to strike up a conversation with a stranger every now and again ‚Äî at least for Philly-born designer Jovan O‚ÄôConnor and Kevin Keller, a contractor who hails from Wisconsin. The two met on a sweltering day in August 2010 at Starbucks. He joked that her Frappuccino was not real coffee. She mentioned the heat wave. And that broke the ice. A decade after that, in July 2020, Kevin proposed.  They were engaged for two years before saying ‚ÄúI do‚Äù at Morris Arboretum & Gardens in Chestnut Hill. They chose the picturesque spot for its beautiful landscape and history. Their theme was garden chic, and they worked with women-owned businesses and creatives to pull off their dream day.  ‚ÄúAs a business owner, it was very important to me to highlight the talents of women,‚Äù says the bride.  It was also important to her to dress the part for her own wedding. ‚ÄúAfter designing for so many others‚Äô special days, I was thrilled to be able to wear something that I created for the biggest day of my life,‚Äù says Jovan. She‚Äôd designed a bridal collection prior to the wedding, but Kevin had seen the gowns already ‚Äî and even helped create them. So she needed something new. And not just one, but three.  Let‚Äôs start with the bride‚Äôs favorite ‚Äî her couture ceremony dress and veil. They were inspired by the first Sex and the City movie. ‚ÄúI wanted to re-create that moment when Carrie tries on different wedding dresses,‚Äù she says. Jovan‚Äôs dress was made of feathers and ivory silk taffeta, with a pleated drape and bubble hem.  Kevin didn‚Äôt miss the significance of the style. One of his favorite wedding details was seeing Jovan come down the aisle in her gown.  As for the other two? The first was a Justin Alexander design that she‚Äôd altered. She decided to wear it on the way to the venue ‚Äúinstead of something like a casual outfit because I was in full bridal mode‚Äù and for the first look.  The final costume change was for the reception, into a pearl-filled stunner. Think pearl hand-embroidered lace from Brussels, stringed pearls on the shoulders and sleeves, pearl buttons down the back, and a fishtail bottom filled with pearl-adorned draped godets.  Of course, it wasn‚Äôt just about the fashions. There were also sentimental decor touches ‚Äî the couple used Jovan‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs dinnerware, with its pretty floral detailing, at the reception.  And Jovan and Kevin felt all the love from their 76 guests.  ‚ÄúEveryone we invited has a special part in our story, and to see people who have known and supported our love from the beginning was exactly the vibe we were going for,‚Äù says Jovan.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Savannah"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 18:36:00","Oh, baby back!  A frugal feast of Chili‚Äôs Grill & Bar chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, salads and more delicious Tex-Mex grub wound up stealing the show at Southern belle Madison Mulkey‚Äôs wedding.  The practically minded Savannah, Georgia peach turned to the chain restaurant as a thrifty alternative to traditional catering ‚Äî which can cost an average of $75 per guest, according to wedding website the Knot.  The spread, which Mulkey shared with her followers on TikTok, where the video has been viewed more than 1.3 million times, wound up a steal at $1,950 for 99 guests ‚Äî a far cry from the $7,500 Mulkey says she would have had to spend on the usual chicken-or-fish extravaganza.  ‚ÄúFirst of all, we loved the price point,‚Äù Mulkey said in the TikTok. ‚ÄúYou really can‚Äôt beat that price point. You just can‚Äôt.‚Äù  But, saving thousands of dollars on her big day came with some surprising hidden costs ‚Äî Mulkey said she had to spend more time and energy coordinating pickup for the food than if she‚Äôd hired someone to worry about it for her.  Savannah, Ga., bride Madison Mulkey‚Äôs Chili‚Äôs-catered wedding has gone viral on TikTok. TikTok/brideisapersonality  Guests at the wedding enjoyed a wide selection of Chili‚Äôs classic Tex-Mex fare. Chili's Grill & Bar  ‚ÄúWe had to pick it up pretty early because we didn‚Äôt want to pay for the delivery fees,‚Äù Mulkey noted.  That meant the bride-to-be wound up waiting at her local Chili‚Äôs at 11 o‚Äôclock on the morning of her wedding day. Luckily, she was able to corral the crew at her reception location, who made sure the food was hot, ready, and artfully presented that evening.  ‚ÄúThat was just a lot more work than we had anticipated,‚Äù Mulkey admitted, noting the added pressure placed on venue staff.  And while plenty of Mulkey‚Äôs followers saluted her savvy, others expressed concern over the undue burden borne by workers who perhaps weren‚Äôt properly trained to prepare and present someone else‚Äôs food.  ‚ÄúAs someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,‚Äù one La-Z-Boy labor expert sniped, calling out the bride for skimping.  Mulkey followed up her first video with a clarification ‚Äî she did tip the Chili‚Äôs kitchen staff $300, and that the venue employees were paid hourly, including for any extra time they may have spent on preparation.  The total bill was an entirely resasonable $1,950.04 ‚Äî plus the $300 tip Mulkey says she handed to kitchen staff. TikTok/brideisapersonality  Some skeptics remained unconvinced.  ‚ÄúServers aren‚Äôt cooks, they serve people, not serve whatever purpose you need,‚Äù a commenter complained.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NoaWxpcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXRvLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtd2VkZGluZy1jYXRlcmluZy1mb3Itb25lLWJyaWRlL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NoaWxpcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXRvLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtd2VkZGluZy1jYXRlcmluZy1mb3Itb25lLWJyaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Before couples decide on color schemes, flower arrangements and dessert options, the feat of selecting the perfect venue is at the top of most wedding-planning checklists.  There‚Äôs good news for those looking to get married in Southern California: San Diego County is isn‚Äôt slacking when it comes to majestic landscapes perfect for saying ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù  From coastal cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean to green valleys tucked between mountain ranges, here are five wedding venues with a view in the region:  The Condor‚Äôs Nest Ranch  This rustic wedding venue sits on a 15-acre property in Pala that beholds panoramic views that span all the way to the coast. Couples can share their vows beneath a 200-year-old ash tree as it sways in the wind to the expression of love. This venue is ideal for those who wish to get married surrounded by nature and views of the countryside.  The Coaster Terrace at Belmont Park  Couples who choose this venue to celebrate their big day can expect white sand views of Pacific Beach. With direct view of the westward ocean, this post could make for a perfect sunset wedding. Another quirky yet #SoSanDiego feature is that the venue is just steps from the giant Dipper roller coaster, which adds to an unforgettable view.  Wild Weddings at San Diego Zoo Safari Park  For some, love can be a wild adventure. Couples can enjoy a ‚Äúromance safari‚Äù with wedding day views of giraffes, zebras and rhinos on an African-like savannah located right here in Southern California at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. The venue area has lush green foliage and there are even options to add-on ‚Äúwow-worthy wildlife animal presentations,‚Äù according to the park‚Äôs webpage.  Coronado Cays Yacht Club  This venue offers up a tranquil setting with direct views of the San Diego Bay and Coronado. It‚Äôs located right at the edge of the sandy shore, making for great lighting and photo opportunities. This spot could have sailboats poised in the background, birds flying overhead and is simple enough to make the newlyweds the main focus.  Lakehouse Hotel & Resort  This North County venue is located on the edge of Lake San Marcos, offering less salty yet still awing views of the water. Also surrounding the area ‚Äî green upon green ‚Äî with golf courses that create a quaint and clean wedding day vibe. Wedding day sights may even include some boating passersby or some lakeside wildlife.  If there‚Äôs one thing that‚Äôs for certain when it comes to saying ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù no matter which San Diego County venue you choose ‚Äî the view will be a fairytale come true.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvNS13ZWRkaW5nLXZlbnVlcy13aXRoLWFuLWktZG8tdmlldy1pbi1zYW4tZGllZ28v0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy81LXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWVzLXdpdGgtYW4taS1kby12aWV3LWluLXNhbi1kaWVnby9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-01","Not Discerned","{""Cincinnati"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 21:21:00","CINCINNATI ‚Äî From its lush gardens to its historic charm, the Pinecroft Manor at Crosley Estate is beloved by brides looking for the perfect backdrop for their wedding. But property owners are looking for a divorce from uninvited guests.  It‚Äôs springtime and, without notice, a black cloud takes over the skies. Made up of tens of thousands of black dots flying in seemingly every direction at once, the cloud settles into a nearby tree branch.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll hear it before you see it and then there‚Äôs a tornado of bees around. That‚Äôs how they reproduce, and good luck talking an animal out of reproducing, right?‚Äù beekeeper Phil Hucky said.  The bees are searching for their new home and a new place to create a new hive.  Standing inside the attic of Pinecroft Manor, Hucky is faced with cutting out a nearly 100-year-old floor to retrieve a beehive that has built up between the joists.  ‚ÄúThis is really the only way to get into a hive like this there‚Äôs no access from the outside from underneath anything like that,‚Äù Hucky said. ‚ÄúHoneybees are cavity dwellers so they‚Äôre looking for a space roughly this big which is perfect between the first and second floor houses the joist space is that size and so they‚Äôre looking for those spaces to move into.‚Äù  Swarms on trees in a yard or ones that show up on the side of a home or car can often be captured for free by an area beekeeper from the Southwest Ohio Beekeepers Association or SWOBA. Hucky says the association‚Äôs website has the resources homeowners need.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a very large list of people broken up by region local beekeepers that will come and assist you and take that hive off your hands, typically free of charge,‚Äù he said.  However, once the bees have found a quarter-inch hole or larger on the side of a home and move into the eaves or walls it can become pricey. There‚Äôs no set price within the industry and cutout services can range from a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.  Hucky said homeowners want to make sure they hire someone that understands the construction and has the proper tools for the job.  While someone‚Äôs first response to a honeybee swarm might be to grab the insect spray and kill the bees, Hucky said please don‚Äôt do it for a variety of reasons.  ‚ÄúIf the spray was to kill the hive you still have all that brood and all that honey and it will be like having a large dead animal in the wall,‚Äù Hucky said. ‚ÄúIf that hives been poisoned, you‚Äôre not only poisoning that hive you could potentially poison other hives in the area.‚Äù  He said other honeybees will pick up the scent left behind by the propolis in the hive and could visit the poisoned hive and then carry the pesticide to other hives in the area several miles away.    The good news is while honeybees can swarm at any time, they predominately swarm between April and June, which means we‚Äôre about midway through this year‚Äôs swarm season.  If you find the need for a beekeeper to take care of a swarm in your area, visit the SWOBA website and click the 'Swarm Removal' link at the top of the page.  SWOBA's President Yaser Almusawy encourages property owners to plant bee-friendly flowers. A list can be found on their website.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndjcG8uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy90aG91c2FuZHMtb2YtdW5pbnZpdGVkLWd1ZXN0cy1zd2FybS1jaW5jaW5uYXRpLXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWXSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The pageant contestant, 23, who is pursuing her master's degree in theology, wed her long-time partner Taylor Reed Locklear in a ""romantic"" ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on April 29.  The couple exchanged vows in front of 350 family and friends at the historic St. Philip's Church, where they also got engaged a year earlier.  ""My favorite moment on our wedding day was when I walked down the aisle. For me, time stopped,"" Morehouse tells PEOPLE exclusively.  ""As I draped the blusher of my veil over my face, I held onto my dad's arm. The doors to our church sanctuary opened, and Highland Cathedral began to play. While the bagpipes and the trumpet echoed throughout the church, the moment felt very regal.""  The pair's love story began when Morehouse was a high school senior and Locklear had just graduated from the Citadel Military College of South Carolina. They ran into each other at Morehouse's family's annual Christmas party.  The next day Locklear asked Morehouse out to dinner, and the rest was history. ""Since that first dinner, Taylor has always been a constant in my life,"" she says. ""He never lets a day go by without telling me he loves me, and that is a gift I will never take for granted.""  Taylor Rae Photography  The pageant star walked down the aisle on the arm of her father in a custom lace gown featuring a ruffled skirt created by Israeli designer Pnina Tornai, whose designs have been featured on Sex and the City and Say Yes to the Dress. Morehouse carried a bouquet of pink and white flowers and her stunning veil featured a long train that trailed behind her.  Following the nuptials, the newlywed's reception was held at the nearby Hibernian Hall, where guests were led by a bagpiper dressed in a traditional kilt.  ""As the first Miss USA contestant to get married during her reign as a state titleholder, I hope to show women that it is possible to get married and still chase your dreams,"" says Morehouse.  In August 2022, the Miss USA organization announced in a press release that they were changing their rules for contestants. ""Effective with the 2023 Miss USA competition and state preliminary competitions, women who are or have been married, as well as women who are pregnant or have children, will be able to compete,"" read the release.

The prime time of wedding season is upon us and that includes proposals, bachelorettes and of course, the big day. If you fall into one of those wedding categories or just love all things bridal, consider the next few months your opportunity to admire (and silently judge) every wedding trend, choice and dress that you see IRL or online. Weddings are kind of like individual Met Galas‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre attending, participating or just watching from afar it‚Äôs fun to have an opinion! Approach the subject with expertise by getting familiar with all of the new wedding trends for 2024. If you‚Äôre planning a 2024 wedding, now is the time to understand what themes and trends are on the horizon.  Weddings are, of course, a highly personal event which means that nobody is required or even encouraged to follow trends. These new wedding trends for 2024 simply exist to provide additional inspiration for the wedding day and wardrobe. That being said, the wedding dress trends for 2024 deserve your attention. They are playful, daring, and even a little bit dramatic.  If there‚Äôs anyone that‚Äôs ahead of bridal trends it‚Äôs Hope LaVine, a Los Angeles-based bridal stylist and influencer with over 360k followers across socials. LaVine exclusively covers bridal trends and tries on and reviews new collections herself for an honest first-person perspective. She just returned from bridal fashion week in Barcelona and New York City where she was one of the first to see the designer bridal collections for spring/summer ‚Äô24.  According to LaVine, the biggest and most innovative trend to hit the bridal scene in 2024 will be wedding dress separates. And if you‚Äôre a 2024 bride, this may work in your favor.  ‚ÄúSocial media has told brides that they need to change out of their wedding dress and have a second look or reception outfit. One dress or ‚Äòlook‚Äô is no longer enough these days,‚Äù LaVine explains. ‚ÄúThe bridal designer‚Äôs fix for this is offering separates. Gloves, neck scarfs, detachable sleeves, hooded veils, and even transformative dresses. These separates are giving brides their two bridal looks, all within one dress.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGalia Lahav is a great example of this.‚Äù LaVine continues. ‚Äù They have multiple jackets that can be worn with lace long-sleeve jackets, and overskirts and they even have a mermaid wedding dress that becomes a mini dress (pictured above)‚Äù.  Versatility is becoming a top priority for brides, especially when a wedding budget comes into play. Another way brides are incorporating multiple looks into their wedding wardrobe is by repurposing older family members‚Äô dresses and accessories. The search for ‚ÄúRepurposing mom‚Äôs wedding dress‚Äù has over 38.8 million views on TikTok with dozens of viral videos showcasing the process and transformation of vintage pieces.  This viral TikTok video has amassed over 240k likes and documents the process of repurposing a wedding dress from 1988 into a short rehearsal dinner dress with a more modern feel. There are plenty of other videos on the app showing different versions of the same process so it is a great place to look for inspiration if you‚Äôre considering doing the same.  If you don‚Äôt have a perfect ‚Äô80s hand-me-down ready to repurpose, don‚Äôt fret! Plenty of designers are incorporating vintage designs into their new collections. The style Hope LaVine is most excited about? Drop waist.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so interesting seeing the trends cycle back around. Drop waist was very early 2000s, think classic Vera Wang ‚Äì Victoria Beckham wedding dress. But bridal design trends often mirror fashion trends. With everyone‚Äôs resurgence in their obsessions with corsets, it‚Äôs no surprise that brides are wanting that snatched look in their wedding dress as well.‚Äù LaVine says.  In addition to drop-waist dresses you can expect to see the revival of elegant princess-style gowns, the emergence of capes down the aisle, and the evolution of accessories with a shortened veil in 2024. The good news is that plenty of the trends for 2024 can be incorporated with any wedding aesthetic, so you won‚Äôt have to revolve your entire look around one to be able to participate.  Keep reading for the five biggest wedding dress and bridal accessory trends for 2024. Before you know it, these will be on your IG feed too.  Fairytale Princess Gowns  While sleek and modern trend-driven wedding dress silhouettes have been having a moment over the last couple of years, the princess gown has slowly but surely been regaining its power. This dress silhouette capitalizes on the drama and grandeur associated with fairytale romance. The focal point of a princess dress is the large skirt that juts out at the waistline. Beyond this distinguishing feature, there‚Äôs plenty of room to customize the style to fit your happily ever after. Monique Lhuillier, for example, featured a dress with a multi-layer tiered skirt and a lace bodice with high-neck and long sleeves in the most recent collection. The dress is reminiscent of old royalty while the skirt detailing makes it more modern. Designer Liz Martinez took a different approach with a simple silhouette but used textured fabric to add dimension to the look.  Dramatic Capes  You don‚Äôt need an entire outfit change to make a statement at your wedding. Capes have made a dramatic entrance on the bridal scene. Whether it‚Äôs tulle, lace or silk, a cape will elevate your entire bridal look. As presented by Elie Saab, a cape (especially one with a hood) is also a cool alternative to a veil. It will add movement to your look when you walk down the aisle or through cocktail hour and will also look great in photos. One of the best parts about a cape is that they work over a variety of dress silhouettes‚Äîif you already have your dress picked out, try a cape over it for good measure.  Flower Appliqu√©s  The flower appliqu√© or rosette trend is a main character in fashion right now. On any piece of clothing, whether it be a swimsuit, skirt or as demonstrated here, a wedding dress, you can find bold flowers added for extra detail. This is by far the most general trend-driven bridal trend for 2024 but one could argue it‚Äôs easily the most natural fit. Choosing a dress with flower detailing can help tie together the overall aesthetic of your wedding. If you‚Äôre envisioning a garden party, flower appliqu√©s will obviously fit right in. On the contrary, if you have a very minimalist aesthetic or dress, a large rose, like the one seen at Badgley Mischka, or a cluster of flowers on your shoulder, as shown by Ines de Santo, can add dimension to your look.  Short Veils  Short wedding dresses, specifically for a reception look, are an increasingly common choice for brides‚Äîand right along with it we have the emergence of the short veil. The short veil silhouette is both elegant and modern which also makes it a popular choice for the untraditional bride. Unlike a classic long veil, a short veil acts as more of a hair accessory rather than a part of the dress silhouette which is why it‚Äôs most usually worn with a shorter or fitted dress style. If you‚Äôre planning on changing for the reception or taking a romantic trip to city hall, a short veil is the way to go.  Something (Or Everything) Blue  The tradition of wearing something blue is far from being a trend but having the color incorporated as a main feature in a bridal look definitely is. Brides are embracing the shade and wearing it to compliment classic white bridal pieces. Sareh Nouri‚Äôs latest bridal collection does an excellent job of showing how blue can be paired with wedding dresses by adding oversized blue bows, printed fabric or embellished gloves. Oscar de la Renta also has a gorgeous blue lace gown that would work as a wedding dress. The difference between this trend and previous iterations of ‚Äúsomething blue‚Äù is that these blue pieces are a part of the primary ceremony look and not just used as a subsequent reception accessory.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc3R5bGVjYXN0ZXIuY29tL3dlZGRpbmctdHJlbmRzLTIwMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eventually, I had to move to the backup plan‚Äôs backup plan: a little walk in Central Park as the sun set and the park‚Äôs night creatures started to come out of the shadows to greet our newly engaged life in a giant rat-and-cockroach-themed musical number.‚Äù  Their wedding was held at the Inn at Perry Cabin in St. Michaels, Maryland, where Hanna‚Äôs parents have spent many wedding anniversaries over the years. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also very close to where I grew up in Maryland,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúAnd where Wedding Crashers was filmed!‚Äù  The rehearsal dinner at the Chesapeake Maritime Museum kicked off the weekend‚Äôs festivities.

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, accuses driver Jamie Komoroski, 25, and the owners of five South Carolina bars ‚Äî Snapper Jacks, The Drop In, The Crab Shack, El Gallo Bar & Grill and Taco Boy, where Komoroski was employed ‚Äî of negligence and wrongful death in the crash on Folly Beach on April 28 that killed Samantha Miller, 34, of Charlotte, North Carolina, as she and her husband, Aric Hutchinson, 36, were leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart.  The suit alleges that employees of the bars Komoroski allegedly visited the night of April 28 overserved her even though she was ‚Äúnoticeably and visibly intoxicated‚Äù and that she got behind the wheel after an alleged ‚Äúbooze-filled day of bar hopping.‚Äù  Hutchinson, the groom, was seriously injured, sustaining a brain injury and broken bones. A witness reported that Komoroski ‚Äúwas dazed and confused‚Äù at the scene and repeatedly said ‚ÄúI did nothing wrong‚Äù and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller at their wedding. via GoFundMe  Hutchinson said Saturday at a memorial in Miller‚Äôs honor on Folly Beach that he is feeling ‚Äújust as good as I can feel with the situation.‚Äù He filed the suit both as the representative of Miller's estate and on his own behalf, the complaint says.  Danny Dalton, the attorney representing Miller‚Äôs family, said in a statement that the case ‚Äúis about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly.‚Äù  A spokesperson for the state Revenue Department‚Äôs alcohol beverage licensing bureau said the state does not require businesses to mandate training for alcohol servers but maintains a list of recommended training programs on its website.  Many states, including South Carolina, allow people to pursue civil actions against businesses that serve intoxicated customers who subsequently cause harm.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm, according to online court records. She remains in custody.  Komoroski‚Äôs attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in an email Thursday morning that he was not representing her in the civil case. He said in a statement: ‚ÄúWe cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.‚Äù  The lawsuit also names Komoroski‚Äôs workplace, Taco Boy, and an unnamed supervisor of the Folly Beach restaurant as defendants, alleging the supervisor organized a night of drinking for employees before the tragedy unfolded and pressured Komoroski and other attendees to drink heavily. The complaint says the supervisor knew that ‚ÄúKomoroski had a previous history of alcohol abuse,‚Äù but it does not elaborate further. It also claims her employers allowed Komoroski ""to simply leave and drive away after having consumed a dangerous amount of alcohol.""  Melissa Reardon, the communications director for Taco Boy, said in a statement that there was no ""organized employee function around drinking"" the day of the crash and that 16 hours of video and interviews with staff members show that Komoroski did not go to the restaurant that day. She added that it was ""untrue"" that Komoroski's supervisor knew anything about an alleged ""previous history of alcohol abuse,"" as the complaint alleges.  Reardon said Komoroski had recently been hired and had trained for only two days before April 28, adding that her employment has been terminated.  ""Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy,"" Reardon said in the statement. ""Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.""  The complaint also alleges that the management of Taco Boy and the managements of the bars Komoroski allegedly visited that night failed to properly train employees to recognize signs of intoxication and prevent overserving.  Reardon said in her statement that restaurant staffers are ""committed to serving alcohol responsibly"" and are required to complete training programs to prevent overserving.  A representative for Snapper Jacks declined to comment and directed calls to a corporate phone number, which no one answered.  Representatives for The Drop In and El Gallo Bar & Grill declined to comment.  A representative for The Crab Shack could not immediately be reached for comment.  Allegations of an alcohol-fueled evening  The lawsuit alleges that Komoroski began her evening drinking at El Gallo Bar & Grill in Charleston before she drove 26 miles south to the city of Folly Beach, where she allegedly drank at three more local bars: The Drop In, The Crab Shack and Snapper Jacks.  ‚ÄúOver the course of several hours, Jamie Komoroski slurred and staggered her way through each of these bars, consuming an assortment of alcoholic beverages, including beer, tequila shots, shift shots of liquor on the house, etc.,‚Äù the suit alleges.  ‚ÄúBy the end of the night, Jamie Komoroski was grossly and dangerously intoxicated,‚Äù it says.  Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, only briefly hit the brakes before her vehicle smashed into the golf cart in Folly Beach, S.C., on April 28. Folly Beach Police Department  Komoroski's blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina, which is 0.08%, according to a toxicology report.  The incident report says she told a sergeant at the scene of the crash ‚Äî on the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue in Folly Beach ‚Äî that she had two drinks that night, a beer and a ‚Äútequila pineapple an hour ago or so.‚Äù Komoroski refused to perform any field sobriety tests, and she was swaying as a sergeant asked her to stand up, according to the incident report.  A sergeant said he ‚Äúsmelled an odor of alcohol coming from her breath and person,‚Äù the incident report says, adding that Komoroski was driving 65 mph per hour in a 25 mph zone ‚Äî and in the opposite direction of her home ‚Äî at the time of the crash.  A quest for accountability  The lawsuit also names as defendants 20 unspecified ‚ÄúJane Does‚Äù who may have contributed to the events.  Also named as plaintiffs, alongside Hutchinson, are Benjamin Garrett, Hutchinson's brother-in-law, and his son, a minor, who were driving the newly married couple in a golf cart back to their accommodations for the evening and suffered ""terrible and permanent injuries,"" the complaint says.  Andrew Gilreath, the director of the Folly Beach Public Safety Department, has told The Associated Press that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Hutchinson and the other plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and unspecified damages, according to the lawsuit.  Dalton, the family's attorney, said the family hopes filing the lawsuit will allow it to learn more about what happened in the hours and minutes before the fatal crash and who should be held responsible.  ‚ÄúThere are still many details we don‚Äôt know about the sequence of events leading up to the tragic crash, but by filing a lawsuit, we can begin the legal discovery process that allows us to get the answers that Samantha‚Äôs family deserves,"" Dalton said in a statement.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvY3JpbWUtY291cnRzL2dyb29tLXdob3NlLXdpZmUtd2FzLWtpbGxlZC13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LWNyYXNoLWZpbGVzLXN1aXQtZHJpdmVyLWJhcnMtcmNuYTg1MDMx0gEqaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9hbXAvcmNuYTg1MDMx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lyndsey McAteer had gastric sleeve surgery to shrink her stomach by 80 per cent in a bid to reach her target weight of 13 stone after a treatment plan and a pregnancy caused her to pile on the pounds.  The mum-of-two, who has endured gruelling chemotherapy and a mastectomy, is now determined to get in shape to tie the knot with her fianc√© Martin O‚ÄôConnor next year.  Lyndsey, from Renfrew, is also training to take part in Cancer Research UK‚Äôs Race for Life.  She said: ‚ÄúI still have some weight to lose, but I‚Äôm feeling great after losing eight and half stone since my surgery last September.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting married next year so I‚Äôm determined to get in shape and I‚Äôm looking forward to doing Race for Life, I can‚Äôt wait. It‚Äôs going to be an amazing day and a great way to mark 10 years of being clear of cancer.‚Äù  It will be an emotional moment for Lyndsey when she stands on the start line at Glasgow Green ahead of the 5k on May 21. The 40-year-old, who was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer at just 29, knows exactly how vital it is to raise funds for life-saving research.  She took part in her first Race for Life event in May 2013 just two days after her fourth chemotherapy treatment for the disease, and when Lyndsey returned to take part in the event the following year, she met Martin.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey after chemo  Lyndsey after chemo (Image: Supplied)  This year, her sons Harris, 12, and Ellis, seven, are joining her alongside her best friend Ruth Coulter.  READ MORE: Jordan Owens and Christopher Hughes among clients of crime gang  Lyndsey said ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve been beating the odds every single day since my diagnosis.  ‚ÄúI pushed my son Harris in his pram at my first Race for Life. Now he‚Äôs at high school and I can‚Äôt believe where that time has gone. Race for Life will always have a special place in my heart, but I know being there will bring back a lot of memories. It‚Äôs a chance to say thank you, to pause for a moment and to take in everything that‚Äôs happened in my life. Life has been a rollercoaster these past 10 years but I feel blessed to be here.‚Äù  Story continues  Lyndsey was a single mum to two-year-old Harris when she found a lump in her left breast. Just four days before Christmas in 2012, tests confirmed she had breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and marked her 30th birthday in hospital recovering from surgery.  Before beginning chemotherapy at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, doctors warned the treatment could make her infertile. She was offered the chance to have her eggs frozen but decided against it.  Lyndsey said: ‚ÄúI already had my son Harris.  ‚ÄúI decided not to freeze my eggs as I didn‚Äôt want to delay the chemotherapy starting. Doctors told me there was a high chance of the cancer coming back so I wanted to get the treatment started as soon as possible.‚Äù  After chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Lyndsey finished treatment in October 2013.

"wedding","2023-07-01","13:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 21:54:00","Civil marriages are on the rise in Israel, and this Israel-based organization has been instrumental in doing so. Chuppot, an organization that provides private religious services and challenges Israel's Chief Rabbinate, has officially celebrated more than 1,000 weddings conducted.  The organization reported a 30% increase in inquiries to those from last year. Chuppot organizes marriages legally outside of the official rabbinical establishment. Now, couples from across Israel can seek other ways to seek their marriage contract through official methods without jumping through additional hoops.  The reported increase in marriage requests can be attributed to several factors, but the organization believes this can best be attributed to the current state of uncertainty in Israel. As the atmosphere in Israel has recently been identified as tense, especially regarding those of political and religious significance, many Israelis have sought other opportunities to seek marriages.  Though many Israelis identify as Jewish and follow Jewish tradition, they may find it tough to differentiate between their religious identities and that of government actions. Marriage falls into this category. With the push for Israel's judicial reform, secular Israelis and non-Jewish residents and citizens of the Jewish state find themselves grappling with the laws of a ""halachic state.""  Providing suitable alternatives for the Israeli public  As a result, Chuppot has stepped in to provide a legal alternative for those wishing to be married in the holy land, while removing one official step. Since Israelis may later have to deal with the rabbinate for other reasons, Chuppot acts as a different messenger.  Rabbi Aaron Leibowitz, president and founder of Chuppot, made note of the increase. ""Every year we are aware of a consistent increase in inquiries and demands for the service we offer. This year, we've seen a drastic increase in the number of inquiries and interest in the weddings we conduct. These have come in just a few months, towards the end of the Omer and the beginning of the summer wedding season,"" he said.  ""Chuppot as an organization has set itself the goal of 'being a rabbi where there is no rabbi,' according to the religion of Moses and Israel, even if this means that he will not be registered for marriage with the chief rabbinate, Leibowitz added. ""Our activity is carried out of an absolute commitment to Halacha and the laws of Orthodox Judaism. All rabbinic activity within the project is committed to Halacha and takes place without breaking its boundaries.  ""In cases where the couples encounter a difficult and discriminatory policy, the treatment they receive in chuppahs is open and friendly - one that will allow each couple to express their wishes in the design of the canopy and the ceremony.""  Rivka Arbiv, CEO of Chuppot, elaborated on the different types of couples approaching the organization. ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah. These couples chose to make a 'turn,' to recalculate a route and find a solution that would allow them to hold a Jewish-religious ceremony, but to be freed from the shackles of dependence on the rabbinate.""  Arbiv continued, ""There are also couples who choose an alternative to the rabbis for ideological reasons - beginning with the desire to design a more egalitarian or feminist chuppah ceremony. Some are just tired of the Rabbinate.""  ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah."" Rivka Arbiv  Arbiv says that couples fearful of religious coercion have significantly contributed to the increase in these numbers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzM3OdIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMzNzkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""When I got off the phone, I said, 'I think Kensington Palace just called me?' Two days later I was sitting in front of [Harry and Meghan] talking concepts,"" the celebrated photographer exclusively tells PEOPLE in this week's issue.  Lubomirski, 47, looks back at the commission ‚Äî which he initially thought was a prank ‚Äî in his new book The Sittings (2003-2023), a collection of 113 of his favorite portraits. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's engagement photos are included in the spread, alongside his images of their royal wedding day in May 2018. Reflecting on how it all came together, Lubomirski tells PEOPLE that the original call came on an emotional day for his family.  L: Caption . PHOTO: Alexi Lubomirski R: Caption .

Their mother went on to a successful recovery, and Lubomirski had the honor of snapping Prince Harry, 38, and Meghan, 41, at Frogmore House for their engagement in December 2017. The British photographer tells PEOPLE he was inspired by an iconic shot of Audrey Hepburn's husband Mel Ferrer wrapping her in his coat, and he asked Harry to do the same with his then-fianc√©e.  ""It just popped in my head because I saw his overcoat and I said, 'Can you put that on?' And then everything just starts folding together,"" he tells PEOPLE of the creative process.  Ed Feingersh/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty  That spring, Lubomirski was called back to Windsor Castle to shoot Prince Harry and Meghan's historic royal wedding, summing it up as ""probably the most high-pressure job"" he's had to date.  ""That was a blur,"" recalls the photographer, himself the descendant of a Polish princely house. ""I got about two hours of sleep the night before, thinking to myself, 'Okay, do I have everything?

"wedding","2023-05-17","21:25:00","{""Kottayam"", ""Kerala"", ""India""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:55:00","May 17, 2023 09:25 pm | Updated 09:29 pm IST - KOTTAYAM  The uncertainty over the wedding of Justin from Kottody in Kasaragod on Thursday continues, though the 31-year-old stands in the cusp of creating history.  He is now slated to become the first person to retain his membership with the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam while marrying a woman from outside the sect. The marriage of Justin with Vijimol has already garnered much attention as the occasion is expected to mark the end of endogamy practised by the community.  After much wrangling with the administrators of his parish, St. Anne‚Äôs Church in Kottody, which even witnessed police intervention, the youth is now expected to receive a ‚Äòvivaha kuri‚Äô or consent on Thursday morning. ‚ÄúThis is a difficult situation as I am keen on receiving a consent from my Church,‚Äù he said.  The stand hitherto  The development assumes significance as the Church has hitherto refused to acknowledge its members‚Äô marriage to those from other sects and made them apply for Permission to Leave Eparchy of Kottayam (PLEK). Mr. Justine, however, could secure consent for his betrothal last month in view of a recent High Court order in this regard.  The Knanaya Catholic community traces its origin back to Jewish-Christian immigrant community that migrated from southern Mesopotamia to the Malabar coast of Kodungallur in AD 345 under the leadership of merchant Thomas of Cana.  On August 29, 1911, Archeparchy of Kottayam, the only archdiocese for the Knanaya members, was formed through a Papal bull for the Knanaya community to maintain their ethnic identity. They formed an endogamous community by not allowing members to marry persons from other Christian communities.  Challenged in 1989  The practice was first challenged by Biju Uthup in 1989 when the Church refused permission for his marriage sacrament citing that Uthup‚Äôs grandmother did not belong to the Knanaya Church. The fight was eventually taken up by the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samithi (KCNS), a reformation group.  On the basis of a petition filed by the KCNS on April 30, 2021, the additional subcourt in Kottayam had issued a decree of permanent injunction prohibiting termination of the membership of any person of the Knanaya archeparchy of Kottayam for marrying a Catholic from any other diocese. After an appeal against this order was dismissed by the district court, the Church approached the High Court for a stay on the judgement. A single Bench of Justice M.R.

This would take hours as they would have to scroll to find a message that specifically said how they felt.  Now, couples and wedding guests are using Chatbots - and it saves hours.  It is no secret that the age of the AI (artificial intelligence) is upon us and is quickly spreading to all industries.  When most people think about AI, they think of the manipulation of images on social media, virtual weddings, robots taking over jobs that previously belonged to humans, etc.  However, they overlook areas and industries, like the wedding industry, for example.  Couples, who claim to not have the words to write their own wedding vows, have turned to Chatbots to generate it. Although many seem reluctant about this new development in technology, it is becoming widely popular in the wedding industry.    READ MORE | 200 hours, 4 months, 50 000 crystals: Designer's wedding dress sets new world record  According to the Wall Street Journal, ChatGPT is an artificial-intelligence chatbot that is developed by an AI research company, OpenAI, which was released in November last year.  Essentially, it is a language processing tool that is driven by AI technology, which allows you to have human-like conversations and much more, using the chatbot.  The language model can answer questions and assist you with tasks, like writing an essay, coding or even write wedding vows.  A popular wedding-planning website and app, Joy, has incorporated this AI tool to assist couples with writer's block when it comes to writing vows, speeches, toasts, thank-you notes and also coming up with wedding hashtags.

The wedding planning app and website generates vows by asking the person using it to highlight what they love the most about their partner. Then, afterwards, they choose the style of delivery, ranging from Shakespeare, friend, therapist, TikToker, Rumi to pessimistic ex.  For wedding speeches and toasts, the same approach is taken - but, instead of highlighting what you love the most about the couple, you would give details of a memorable story about the them.  It could include how they met, or how you found out that the couple was together. Then, you choose the style of delivery.  The CEO of Joy, Vishal Josh, says he is well aware of people's disapproval of using AI for such sentimental occasions.

Well, now you can do exactly that.  ""Every year there are folks that stop by and say I've lived here my whole life and I've never been here,"" said Julia Mueller, executive director for Linden Hill Historic Estate. Her group is responsible for preserving and sharing the history of the estate in Little Falls.  On a hill overlooking the mighty Mississippi sit two mansions. A white home belonged to Drew Musser, and a green one belonged to Charles Weyerhaeuser.  In the late 1800's the two men were lumber barons and good friends. So much so that they built mansions next to each other. And that's not all they built.  MORE FINDING MINNESOTA: Iron ore and baseball celebrated at Chisholm's Minnesota Museum of Mining  ""There's a carriage house and a barn and another carriage garage,"" said Mueller.  Their families lived here happily, for decades. When the Weyerhaeusers left, they essentially gave their mansion to the Mussers. By 1989, the families were gone and both homes were vacant. But that doesn't mean they were empty.  The green mansion has been turned into a museum, and pretty much everything you see is as it was 120 years ago. In fact, 95% of the furnishings are original.  ""We actually have over 15 sets of their dishes,"" said Mueller.  Each room offers a story of its own, but the basement tends to stand-out for other reasons.  When the Mussers took over the Weyerhaeuser home, they brought over a little bit of Hollywood. The family was good friends with L. Frank Baum, who wrote ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Laura Jane Musser developed a friendship with Margaret Hamilton - the actress best known as the Wicked Witch of the West. According to Mueller, they went to Hawaii together a number of times.  A stopover next door is another step back in time. Except that the white mansion is more a hands-on experience.  ""We pretty much give you the front door keys and you have full reign of this beautiful 12,00 square foot mansion,"" said Angela Imdieke, assistant director.  Family reunions, high school reunions, and even wedding parties frequently rent out the mansion, and the music room is a popular place.  Imdieke had her wedding here. Their reception was held at the Linden Hill pavilion, which used to be the site of a heated, in-ground pool that the Weyerhaeuser's built in 1910.  There are endless books for guests to peruse. And for those that do spend the night, there's no shortage of bedrooms either - they can sleep 25 people, comfortably.  The hope is that guests develop an appreciation for the past by spending a night in the past.  ""One of our frequently-used phrases around here is 'history matters.' And we want folks to be able to enjoy and interact with history in a positive way,"" said Mueller.  The city of Little Falls owns Linden Hill and it's on the National Register of Historic Places.

From taking chartered flights to dancing to yesteryear hit songs of Chiranjeevi in the sangeet, it was unarguably one of the biggest wedding ceremonies of the year.  ott:10  SHARE THIS ARTICLE ON","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90ZWx1Z3UtY2luZW1hL25paGFyaWthLWtvbmlkZWxhLXJlYWN0cy10by13ZWRkaW5nLXJ1bW91cnMtb2YtYnJvdGhlci12YXJ1bi10ZWotYW5kLWxhdmFueWEtdHJpcGF0aGktMTAxNjg0Mzg1MDQ1MTE2Lmh0bWzSAakBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvdGVsdWd1LWNpbmVtYS9uaWhhcmlrYS1rb25pZGVsYS1yZWFjdHMtdG8td2VkZGluZy1ydW1vdXJzLW9mLWJyb3RoZXItdmFydW4tdGVqLWFuZC1sYXZhbnlhLXRyaXBhdGhpLTEwMTY4NDM4NTA0NTExNi1hbXAuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But whilst nothing could be said against Prince Philip's commitment to his wife and his country, his sisters did nothing to help boost his fledging reputation when he married the late Queen in 1947.  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from attending his wedding, in large part because three of them - Cecilie, Sophie and Margarita - had married German aristocrats who became leading members of the Nazi party.  Princess Sophie was even friends with Hermann Goering - the future head of Nazi Germany's air force - and had both Goering and Adolf Hitler round for tea.  Prince Philip's sister Princess Sophie is seen sitting opposite Adolf Hitler at the wedding of Hermann Goering  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from his wedding. From left to right, Princesses Sophie, Cecilie, Theodora and Margarita  Philip's real surname, Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg, signified the German blood that ran through his veins.  His father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, was descended from the German ducal house of the same name.  Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Battenburg, also had German heritage and spent part of her childhood in the country.  The Duke of Edinburgh assumed his mother's maternal surname - Mountbatten, an Anglicised version of the German 'Battenberg' - when he married Princess Elizabeth.  After Cecilie was killed in a plane crash in 1937, a 16-year-old Philip was famously pictured at her funeral in Germany walking alongside relatives in Nazi uniforms.  She was killed along with her newborn baby in Belgium aged just 26. The aircraft's pilot had been attempting to land in thick flog.  The depiction in The Crown of the aftermath of her death was slammed by critics for wrongly suggesting that Philip was blamed by his father for her demise.  The connections between Philip's family and the Nazis - facts that in no way called the Duke's own honour into question - were explored in a Channel 4 documentary in 2014.  It revealed the contents of a memoir written by Princess Sophie in old age, in which she told of a private lunch with Hitler and how she thought he had seemed like a 'charming and seemingly modest man'.

In a sign of their devotion to Nazism, Sophie and her husband named their first son Karl Adolf, in honour of Hitler.  Sophie also wrote in her memoir of how she Goering and Hitler had both visited her home.  Goering came for tea in her flat near Frankfurt before the Nazis came to power in 1933.  She wrote: 'He talked a lot about the new political party which he had joined, the ""Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"".  'He was very enthusiastic about it all, especially about the party leader, a man called Adolf Hitler.  'As Germany was going through hard times and there was a lot of poverty and general dissatisfaction everywhere, we were interested to hear about the great improvements his party was planning to do.'  With Goering insistent that she should meet Hitler personally, the Nazi leader then also came to her flat.  'I had been warned he was a vegetarian, and found it difficult to plan an appropriate meal,' she added.  'In those days we had a cook-housekeeper, which was just as well, as my ideas about cooking and housekeeping were fairly hazy (being only 18 at the time).  'We settled for an assortment of vegetables which turned out to be a great success.'  Sophie was careful to mention how she and her husband changed their view of Hitler 'fundamentally' later on, but said they were impressed 'by this charming and seemingly modest man, and by his plans to change and improve the situation in Germany.'

Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg  Philip as a little boy with his mother Princess Alice of Battenburg and his father Prince Andrew of Greece  Princess Theodora of Greece and Count Berthold of Baden on their wedding day in 1931  The meetings prompted her husband to join the SS, and by 1935 he had been appointed as head of the air ministry's research bureau, according to Princess Sophie.  That year, Sophie was pictured at Goering's wedding, with Hitler seen opposite.  Eight years later, Prince Christoph was killed in a plane crash in 1943, after the Allied invasion of Sicily.  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, who was 16 years older then her brother, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.  He was badly wounded while fighting for Germany on the Russian front and ended up turning against Hitler.  The prince was then among the aristocratic German officers who were implicated in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, which was led by Claus von Stauffenberg.  Cecilie had married George Donatus, the Grand Duke of Hesse in 1931 and they both later joined the Nazi party. The couple had four children.  The fourth, an unnamed son, is believed to have been born during the flight on which the 26-year-old Cecilie lost her life.  Donatus was killed alongside his wife and the plane's other passengers.  Princess Theodora, who was 15 when Philip was born in 1921, was the only one of her brother's sisters who was publicly opposed to Nazism.  Unlike her sisters, she and her husband were allowed to attend the the Queen's Coronation in 1953.  But all Philip's siblings were excluded from the royal wedding in 1947, in large part because it was so soon after the war had ended.  In an interview for 2006 book Royals and the Reich, Philip said his family had found Hitler's attempts to restore Germany's power and status 'attractive'.  'There was a great improvement in things like trains running on time and building,' he explained.  'There was a sense of hope after the depressing chaos of the Weimar Republic.  'I can understand people latching on to something or somebody who appeared to be appealing to their patriotism and trying to get things going. You can understand how attractive it was.'  But the Duke did insist that he had never been aware of 'anybody in the family actually expressing anti-Semitic views'.  Prince Philip is seen with his sister Princess Sophie (both centre) in Germany in March 1953  Prince Philip prays alongside his sister Princess Sophie and Greek Orthodox priests outside the tomb of his mother Princess Alice in 1994  The closest sibling in age to Philip was Sophie, who was born in June 1914 - seven years before her brother.  After her husband Christoph's death, she married Prince George William of Hanover, but the union was controversial.  With Prince George's house of Hanover having been the royal house of England's monarchy for more than two centuries until the death of Queen Victoria, the aristocrat sought permission from King George VI to go ahead with the engagement.  But because the UK was still at war, official permission was not given, although Sophie went on to tie the knot in 1946.  Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, wipes his eye as he sits next to his elder sister Princess Sophie in 1994 at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial  She had three further children with her second husband and passed away aged 87 in 2001, after becoming a confidante to Philip in later life.  She stayed at Birkhall with him and the Queen in the years before the Coronation and she visited Britain regularly, becoming godmother to Prince Edward.  Paying tribute to her after her death, Philip said: 'She did so much kindness in her life that she stored up many gifts in Heaven and I hope she's enjoying them now.'  Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away. She was 63 when she died in 1969.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExNzU3OTU5L0hvdy1QcmluY2UtUGhpbGlwcy1zaXN0ZXItUHJpbmNlc3MtU29waGllLXNhdC1vcHBvc2l0ZS1ISVRMRVItSGVybWFubi1Hb2VyaW5ncy13ZWRkaW5nLmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTc1Nzk1OS9hbXAvSG93LVByaW5jZS1QaGlsaXBzLXNpc3Rlci1QcmluY2Vzcy1Tb3BoaWUtc2F0LW9wcG9zaXRlLUhJVExFUi1IZXJtYW5uLUdvZXJpbmdzLXdlZGRpbmcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 06:16:53","PRESS RELEASE Published May 18, 2023 Marketers Media  The rise of virtual guest books is helping couples move towards a more modern and eco-friendly way to capture memories and animate weddings.  --  The world has seen many changes over the past three years, and the wedding industry has been no exception. With the pandemic forcing couples to postpone or cancel their weddings, many have turned to digital solutions to celebrate their special day. One such solution is the digital guest book provided by wed.tv. It allows guests to send messages and photos to the newly-weds through a simple and user-friendly interface.  Wed.tv has been in operation since 2016, but it was only during the pandemic that its popularity began to soar. The site allows guests to connect using a wedding code, which can be any unique identifier, such as the names of bride and groom. Guests can then send messages and photos via their browser, which are then displayed in a gallery that can be viewed online or projected onto a screen or TV like a slideshow. At the end of the wedding, a PDF featuring all the messages can be generated with just one click, providing a lasting memory of the event for all of the guests.  ""Before the pandemic, wed.tv had fewer than 20 guest books created per month"", said Michele Ampollini, founder of the Company. ""However, since the pandemic began, the number of people creating digital guest books has skyrocketed. By autumn 2021, almost 6,000 guest books had been opened, each receiving an average of more than 50 messages from guests. This trend shows no sign of slowing down, even after the pandemic has ended.""  There are many advantages to using a digital guest book like wed.tv:  It eliminates the need for paper, reducing waste and environmental impact.  Unlike a traditional guest book, there are no limits to the number of messages or photos that can be included.  Guests can include selfies and other photos to create a more visual and personalized record of the wedding.  The PDF created at the end of the event can be easily shared with all guests, making it an unforgettable memory for everyone.  Far from being just a digital version of the paper guestbook, Wed.tv can be used as a cutting-edge photo booth alternative and as an engaging animation tool. It's definitely an instrument without boundaries: guest books have been opened in more than 100 nations, the top users being the US, Singapore, the UK, India, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. Guest books are free for up to 50 guests and 250 messages, which is ideal for small weddings. Users can also purchase a premium version for larger events for as little as $29. Because of wed.tv's popularity, the founders are currently developing Guestbook.tv, a general version of wed.tv designed for occasions like birthdays, graduations, celebrations, parties, and other events.  In the words of Laurent Bedubourg, Company's CTO, ""While the pandemic may have accelerated the trend of digital weddings, it is likely that this trend will continue long after the pandemic is over. The convenience and personalization offered by digital solutions are simply too good to ignore. In addition, as people become more environmentally conscious, these platforms will become even more attractive as they eliminate the need for paper and other physical materials.""  Virtual guest books such as Wed.tv exemplify the industry's innovative response to the pandemic's constraints, allowing couples to embrace digital tools and platforms to improve their special day, and showing the adaptability and resilience of the wedding industry in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Lauryn fires at her mom in a preview clip for ""Mama June: Family Crisis.""  It's safe to say Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Efird wasn't thrilled about the festivities leading up to Mama June Shannon's (second) wedding with Justin Stroud -- or the fact that her mother had another ceremony after already getting married in a courthouse.  In a preview clip for Friday's episode of ""Mama June: Family Crisis,"" Lauryn has a heated conversation -- on her end -- with her mom about having a second wedding and a bridal shower.  ""Why the f--- are you having a wedding?"" Lauryn, 23, tells her mom over FaceTime, to which June replies, ""Because I'm only gonna get married one time.""  ""You already got married though at the courthouse without everybody!"" Lauryn snaps, and June tells her daughter, ""I want everybody there. I want a wedding.""  June and Justin tied the knot back in March 2022 after dating for six months. A year after their civil ceremony, the couple had a second wedding surrounded by friends and family in an intimate waterfront ceremony in February 2023.  During her video call with her mom, Lauryn expresses her frustration that she was told about the ceremony and a bridal shower from Justin's family rather than from her mom.  ""Why the f--- am I finding out from Justin's mother you're going to have a ceremony and f---ing bridal shower?"" she asks June, who says she ""did not know they were going to reach out to y'all on social media.""  ""That's annoying as f---,"" Lauryn fires at her mom. ""It would be nice to hear from the horse's mouth.""  A still ticked off Lauryn then asks June if her upcoming wedding is going to be ""another one of [her] f---ing money pits.'"" While June claims the wedding is going to be on a ""budget,"" the clip shows footage of her talking to Justin about how she wants ""all the bling"" as well as a ""a big cake, a dress, [and] a huge venue.""  Lauryn doesn't seem to believe her mom's words as she tells her, ""June don't never have a f---ing budget. Let's be real, except when it comes to taking care of Alana.""  She then reveals to June that she won't be going to her bridal shower.  ""I already have plans for the bridal shower. So unfortunately, I won't be able to make it, but Doe Doe says she's gonna come,"" she tells June, referencing her aunt Joanne ""Doe Doe"" Shannon, who was sitting next to Lauryn during the FaceTime with her June.  When June asks why Lauryn ""can't make it,"" Lauryn snaps in reply, ""Because I have five kids to f---ing raise, and one of them is yours!""  Lauryn shares four kids with husband Joshua Efirdd: Ella, 5, Bentley, 21 months, and twins Sylus and Stella, who were born last year. She also has temporary custody of June's daughter, Alana, 17.  June suggests that Lauryn bring the kids to her bridal shower -- and they can be ""one big happy family"" -- however, the latter isn't having it.  ""Mama always thinks that she can convince other people who aren't around her 24/7 that she's the best mom out there and that she's all about family and she's all about fixing her relationships,"" Lauryn explains in a confessional. ""I'm gonna tell you what, Justin's family will find out real soon when I don't show up to that bridal shower.""

"wedding","1994-09-16","Not Discerned","{""Houston"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:03:00","Anna Nicole Smith's 1994 wedding to J. Howard Marshall captivated fans ‚Äî and made the icon into a punchline. But 16 years later ‚Äî and the subject of a new documentary, Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me ‚Äî perhaps Smith was the one telling the joke.  In 1992, Smith's extraordinary beauty launched her from small-town fried chicken server to worldwide fame, with five Playboy covers and as the face of Guess jeans. Smith then gained small parts in movies such as Naked Gun 33 1/3 and The Hudsucker Proxy. She smoldered from billboards, walked the red carpet at the Oscars and charmed late-night hosts like Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall.  But the whole time, she was hiding a secret: she was in a relationship.  Wearing a 22-carat diamond at age 26, Smith married an 89-year-old Houston oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall in 1994. The groom, one of the richest men in America, was wheeled up the aisle behind his bride as ""Tonight I Celebrate My Love For You"" was played. Doves were released at the end in the empty chapel.  Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG via Getty  ""She was adaptable to get what she needed,"" says Smith's friend Missy Byrum, who insists Smith was single-minded in her devotion to providing a good life for her son Daniel. ""But she could be herself with Mr. Marshall and that made her happy.""  Smith ‚Äî who is now the subject of the Netflix documentary Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me ‚Äî met Marshall while dancing at a Houston strip club in the late 1980s and went on their first date in 1991.  Byrum tells the story of their early romance this way: ""Mr. Marshall's mistress had just died. [The dancer] went and had a cosmetic procedure done that was supposed to be a routine cosmetic procedure. But it killed her for whatever reason. Lady Walker was her name.""  Byrum continues, ""Mr. Marshall was very despondent. So his driver took him into [the strip club] Legs, which is where Nicki was working at the time and she met him. She could tell that he was despondent and everything.""  Anna Nicole Smith. DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock  Byrum adds, ""She would have lunch with him and stuff like that ‚Äî Red Lobster ‚Äî but she was trying to keep him a secret from the press after she got her cover. She couldn't disclose him to Guess or anybody at Playboy.""  Marshall, Byrum says, paid for some of Smith's surgeries. ""I believe she had already had her third boob job at this point. But Mr. Marshall paid for a fourth. They put two implants in each breast. That's why they were so big."" Eventually Marshall would buy Smith a car, diamonds and a house in Houston where she and Daniel could live.  Smith's uncle George Beall says of his niece (who was born Vickie Lynn Hogan): ""She really loved him! The way he took care of her and looked out for her. She cared about him a lot. She didn't want people to think that she was after his money. Aunt Kay and I both said to Vickie Lynn, 'If you love him, to heck with what people think!'""

Later, while she was living in Malibu with the film producer Ashley Wells Lewis, Smith would say she was being followed regularly, by people who worked for a man with whom Smith was involved.  ""It frightened her,"" Lewis says. ""She never told me who it was. She said, 'Ashley, people, they follow me everywhere I go. Dinner, my friends, they're right with me.'""  She would get home and report to Lewis, ""I lost them. I took lots of cuts and corners.""  The men were possibly working for Marshall, Byrum says, who claims she and Smith would ""hide in hotels where Mr. Marshall couldn't find us and do our crack smoking.""  Byrum ‚Äî who had her own intimate relationship and informally married the pin-up in a backyard ceremony in 1993 ‚Äî says Smith truly loved Marshall, but adds, ""she needed more attention than any one person could give her.""  According to Lewis, ""Anna spent her life in pursuit of happily ever after.""  Following Marshall's death at age 90 in 1995, Smith sued in Texas for $475 million, half of the late oil tycoon's estate, but lost in a September 1997 ruling that declared Pierce the sole heir, also shutting out Marshall's oldest son, J. Howard Marshall III.  The court battle took years and included a slew of mudslinging from both sides, with Smith even accusing Pierce of wanting his father dead during one heated May 1998 testimony. That summer, Smith teamed up with Marshall's disinherited older son Howard to sue Pierce, alleging that Pierce conspired for 20 years to take all of his father's fortune for himself. Partly because of complications arising from Smith filing for bankruptcy in 1996, different judges issued contrary rulings, with Smith winning $474 million, then slashing that to $88 million. The case was appealed all the way to the federal Supreme Court, which ruled in Smith's favor.  Pierce died in June 2006 at age 67 from an infection before he could successfully prosecute the case further, but his wife, Elaine, continued on behalf of his estate, even after Smith's death from an accidental overdose in 2007. In 2010, it was finally ruled that Smith's estate was not entitled to any money from Marshall's estate.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9hbm5hLW5pY29sZS1zbWl0aC1qLWhvd2FyZC1tYXJzaGFsbC13ZWRkaW5nc2hlLXRydWx5LWxvdmVkLWhpbS1iZWNhdXNlLWhlLWFjY2VwdGVkLWhlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:49:24","Florida Vow Renewals, Eloping in Florida, and Florida Beach Weddings on a Budget are showcased with Suncoast Weddings Beach Wedding Packages.  This press release was orginally distributed by ReleaseWire  Treasure Island, FL -- (ReleaseWire) -- 05/17/2023 -- Planning a beach wedding offers the opportunity to weave ocean and beach-themed elements into the big day, from seashell-inspired bouquets to elements of decor. Suncoast Weddings, premier wedding planners based on the west coast of Florida, have a team of experts on hand to help guide and advise couples who are looking for creative ways to customize their beach wedding or beach vow renewal to make it unique and memorable. One of the easiest ways to customize the decor is to opt for aisle markers that are reminiscent of the beach. Good examples that are always firm favorites include white starfish, brown starfish, and conch shells. They can be mixed and matched along the aisle if preferred. The conch shells have a blush pink interior and so they are sometimes paired with a blush theme, with either blush chiffon accents on the arch and chairs, or blush chiffon drapes on the arch. A popular arch for smaller ceremonies is the signature Suncoast arch, which has two upright posts. For larger ceremonies with more guests in attendance, couples often opt for the four-post tropical arch. All of the arches, including the two-post bamboo, the four-post bamboo, and the two-post birchwood arch can be draped and decorated in a variety of ways. A crystal chandelier is a stylish addition to the arch, however, in sticking with the beach wedding theme, Suncoast Weddings also have a shell chandelier available for the main event. Shells are also featured commonly in the unity sand ceremony, where the couple pours sands from decorative shells into a heart-shaped keepsake bottle. The sand can be natural, or colored. Mixing natural sand and colored sand creates a pretty layering of the sands within the bottle, as they are poured at the same time. For ceremonies that include children, each child can also have their own shell and unique sand color on the unity sand table, so all of the sands mingle as they are poured. Another way to customize along the lines of a beach-inspired day is the bouquet and boutonniere. Seashells are popular, with a range of shapes, textures, and colors to choose from. In addition to seashells, pearls, starfish, and sand dollars can also be incorporated. Often a bouquet or boutonniere combines an element of the sea, like a seashell, with a more traditional floral component - such as an orchid with a starfish, or a lily with a seashell. The use of pale blue ribbons is another way to evoke the sea and Florida skies. Jewelry is a unique way to extend the theme to the wedding party, with starfish hair pins, seashell bracelets or anklets, and a traditional classic that takes on a new significance at a beach wedding, a pearl necklace. A fun-filled way to take the beach inspiration through to a beach wedding reception is to have a cake which is inspired by either a sandcastle, the ocean, or the beach. From corals, to bubbles, to pearls, seashells, and ombre shades of blue, there are many designs to choose from, with a gallery of inspiration on the social media profiles of Suncoast Weddings. Starfish cake toppers are a particular favorite that always makes family and friends smile. Many of these ideas to incorporate the beach or the ocean theme into a beach wedding can be done in a budget-friendly way. To discuss these ideas and explore more possibilities for a Florida beach wedding that is customized and tailored, contact the Suncoast Weddings team.  All ceremonies can be tailored with Suncoast Weddings, to individualize the decor and details. From small ceremonies for couples looking at eloping in Florida to lavish ceremonies with a hundred guests, ceremonies can be made to be unique.  Permits are required at most public beaches and should be submitted for approval as early as possible in the planning process to make sure that the location and date can be secured. Suncoast Weddings can help with the permit application process and will add the cost of the permit to the personalized proposal, as the cost varies from city to city.  Florida beach weddings and reception packages may start with a search for cheap beach wedding packages however there are many other outgoings that need to be tallied, like the dress, the travel budget, and certainly the reception. Affordable Florida beach wedding Packages typically take several elements of the ceremony and offer them at a reduced price when compared to building the wedding from scratch. This effectively 'bundles and saves' which offers the best value for money for the services delivered. Planning the wedding and reception together as part of a package helps to keep the costs totaled in one place and easier to track. A popular alternative to a traditional reception is a dinner cruise reception sailing the inland waterways around St Pete Beach, Madeira Beach, and Clearwater. This affords a great view of the dramatic and ever-changing scenery as the wedding party enjoys the reception fare. With a choice of paddleboats and sleek modern boats, couples can choose a package and location which suits their style and budget.  Treasure Island Weddings, St Pete Beach weddings, Siesta Key weddings, and Clearwater beach weddings boast spectacular sunset views over the Gulf of Mexico, perfect for couples who want sunset wedding day portraits.

SISTERS star Tammy Slaton has ditched her wedding ring since striking up a romance with her new boyfriend, Greg Morgan, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal.  Tammy, 36, showed off her single status and got caught in new photos while out on a day trip earlier this month to Indiana with her brother Chris Combs, 41.  5 Tammy Slaton has been spotted out and about without her wedding ring Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  5 She did appear to wear some sort of band on her right hand, but has ditched her ring since her split from ex Caleb Willingham Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  The 1000-Lb. Sisters star took a road trip away from her Kentucky home to a Sam's Club in Indiana on May 4 to stock up on groceries and supplies.  She was caught on camera without her wedding ring on her special finger; however, she was spotted wearing some sort of a band on her right hand.  The band on her right hand was visible as Tammy nervously bit her fingernails while on a grocery cart scooter headed into the Sam's Club.  When The U.S. Sun obtained photos of Tammy out on the town back in April, she was spotted wearing her wedding ring despite rumors she had already split from her ex, Caleb Willingham, 40.  The U.S. Sun confirmed the rumors of Tammy's split earlier this month.  ALREADY OVER  An insider exclusively told The U.S. Sun Tammy and her husband Caleb are officially separated and she is in the process of filing for divorce.  ""Tammy has her legal team lined up and is ready to file for divorce,"" the source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star claimed.  ""They split up because Caleb hasn't been following his diet in rehab,"" the insider alleged, adding: ""He has gained 30 lbs and hasn't been working his program.""  ""They got into a big fight over it and he told her he wanted a divorce, but then he tried to backtrack,"" the insider claimed.  Reportedly, Caleb tried to keep their marriage together after the falling out, but it was too late.  ""Tammy's sisters Amy and Amanda were already encouraging her to just move on,"" the source elaborated.  The family insider said they believed that Tammy's decision to end it with Caleb was the right thing for her.  ""She wants someone who can be there for her and his health keeps declining. She would have to take care of him once he's out of rehab, and that is her taking on the care of a whole other person when she can barely take care of herself, so the relationship is pointless,"" the insider added.  ""They got married after just knowing each other over the course of weeks, in rehab, and he's still there,"" the source continued, claiming: ""She didn't want a long-distance relationship and certainly isn't able to care for someone else at this point in her recovery.""  The insider added that Tammy's assets are protected though, and alleged Caleb signed a prenuptial agreement.  Tammy's rep and Caleb did not respond to requests for comment.  REBOUND ROMANCE  Multiple sources claim Tammy has been secretly seeing Indiana-based TikToker Greg Morgan after meeting him on a dating app.  One source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star said: ""Tammy met Greg on one of the apps, and they immediately hit it off.""  The source added: ""They've been seeing each other for about a month now.""  ""He's come to see her a handful of times and takes a six-hour bus from Indianapolis to visit her in Kentucky,"" the insider claimed.  During one recent visit, Greg even met Tammy's family.  The source said the new couple stopped by her sister Amy's home for a visit, and Greg met her nephews Gage, 2, and Glenn, 10 months.  A second insider claimed Tammy paid for his bus rides to her town.  ""They've been talking regularly and they seem to really like each other, but they are trying to figure out when he'll visit again, because things get tough around her filming schedule,"" the second source said.  The first source added: ""Tammy is shy around him and didn't want to eat in front of him. She said she finds him very attractive.""  Greg and Tammy have also publicly communicated over TikTok, and she has commented on his page: ""Aww you love me.""  5 When Tammy was out and about last April, she was still spotted sporting her wedding band on her left hand Credit: Matt Symons for The US Sun  5 Tammy is reportedly seeking to divorce Caleb after being married for only six months Credit: Michael Moretti","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE0NDQwOC90YW1teS1zbGF0b24tc2luZ2xlLXJpbmctcGhvdG9zLWJveWZyaWVuZC1leC1jYWxlYi13aWxsaW5naGFtL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE0NDQwOC90YW1teS1zbGF0b24tc2luZ2xlLXJpbmctcGhvdG9zLWJveWZyaWVuZC1leC1jYWxlYi13aWxsaW5naGFtL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

In an interview with ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù that aired Wednesday, juror Saul Hernandez said he was initially unconvinced that the Idaho prosecutors had proven Vallow Daybell‚Äôs guilt.  But just a few hours into deliberations, he was swayed by gruesome evidence that made it ‚Äúharder to look at‚Äù the mom.  ‚ÄúGrowing up, you talk about good and bad, God and evil. And I think for the first time in my life, I put a face to evil,‚Äù Hernandez said.  The juror recalled how he was ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù by photos of the couple happily dancing at their beach wedding in Hawaii in early November 2019, just a few weeks after Tammy Daybell mysteriously died.  Hernandez said he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to look at‚Äù the chilling pictures.  Saul Hernandez sat down with ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù following last week‚Äôs verdict. ABC News / GMA  The loved-up snaps show Vallow Daybell and Chad grinning and holding hands with leis around their necks.  Investigators believe that Tylee and J.J. ‚Äî who were last seen in September 2019 ‚Äî were also dead by this point and had been buried in shallow graves on Chad‚Äôs Salem property, where they were found several months later.  ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt believe how someone can be that happy when your kids are in the ground. And the person that was key in all of this is sitting across from you, smiling at you and dancing with you on the beach,‚Äù Hernandez said of the callous pair.  Hernandez said he was ‚Äúdisgusted‚Äù by Vallow Daybell and Chad‚Äôs wedding photos. ABC News  Throughout the proceedings, the mom‚Äôs defense team attempted to portray her as a loving and devout mother who was manipulated by Chad, a noted doomsday author.  Ultimately, however, Hernandez said he bought the prosecution‚Äôs argument that Vallow Daybell was a wannabe cultist driven by ‚Äúmoney, power, and sex‚Äù to kill her children and conspire to help Chad murder Tammy as well.  Following seven hours of deliberation, Vallow Daybell was found guilty by the jury.  ‚ÄúThey wanted to believe something that only applied and benefited them, only applied and benefited those people they liked, their circle that they liked and they wanted to be around,‚Äù Hernandez said of the couple‚Äôs pseudo-religious fantasies.  Lori Vallow Daybell faces the possibility of life in prison without parole. via REUTERS  He noted that he thinks Vallow Daybell‚Äôs beliefs ‚Äî which included predictions of Jesus Christ‚Äôs second coming in 2020 ‚Äî started as ‚Äúcuriosity‚Äù but became more intense ‚Äúonce Chad came into the picture.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think, as a human being, you are ever really prepared to experience this,‚Äù Hernandez said of his time on the high-profile case.  Vallow Daybell faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow were last seen in September 2019.  The killer mom barely suppressed a smug grin in her new mugshot from Madison County Jail, where she was booked after the verdict.  Meanwhile, Chad Daybell is set to be tried on a similar slew of charges at a later date.  In a statement following Vallow Daybell‚Äôs conviction, the Madison and Fremont County prosecutors said they were still ‚Äúcommitted to pursuing justice‚Äù for the three victims.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2xvcmktdmFsbG93LWp1cm9yLXdhcy1kaXNndXN0ZWQtYnktZG9vbXNkYXktbW9tcy13ZWRkaW5nLXNuYXAv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbG9yaS12YWxsb3ctanVyb3Itd2FzLWRpc2d1c3RlZC1ieS1kb29tc2RheS1tb21zLXdlZGRpbmctc25hcC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The newly filed lawsuit alleges Komoroski had a ‚Äúbooze-filled day of bar hopping‚Äù and the establishments she visited that day had an obligation to ‚Äúexercise due care‚Äù in serving alcoholic beverages. In addition to Komoroski, the lawsuit names Snapper Jacks, The Drop-In Bar and Deli, The Crab Shack, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Holdings, LLC.  Court documents allege Komoroski started drinking at El Gallo Bar and Grill before going to Folly Beach and visiting several bars on Center Street.  Attorney Danny Dalton answered questions Wednesday afternoon about the newly-filed suit. He said they began an investigation into the details leading up to the crash.  The husband of the newlywed killed on their wedding night on Folly Beach in a DUI crash has filed a lawsuit.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still facts and a lot of questions that haven‚Äôt been answered, which is part of the reason we wanted to file the lawsuit, was to get into the formal discovery process where we and the families can get more definite answers to some of the questions that are still a little vague to us,‚Äù he said.  Each of the named establishments ‚Äúshould have known that they had the authority and obligation to train, control, and supervise their respective employees, agents, or servants, including any bartenders, servers or any other employee‚Äù to not overserve patrons alcohol and not place others at risk of incurring serious injury or death, the lawsuit states.  In naming Taco Boy, the lawsuit states Komoroski had been an employee for a short time. The lawsuit alleges the restaurant was negligent by ‚Äúorganizing, arranging, and supervising an employee function/meeting knowing that excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages would be purchased for, served to, and/or consumed by the employees attending the function/meeting.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat our investigation yielded was that she had been an employee of [Taco Boy] for a short period of time, not very long, and that there was an almost routine gathering to go out to bars or a bar after their shifts or, you know, in the middle of their shifts or at different times, and their supervisors would also attend those gatherings or those events, call them what they were, and that she had attended this and that there was significant drinking at that event,‚Äù Dalton said. ‚ÄúAnd so, there‚Äôs a responsibility, especially when you have a supervisory role, but as an employer, to act responsibly in that role as employer and supervisor, and we felt that that was not done here and that it was breached.‚Äù  insert (Folly Beach Police)  Taco Boy releases statement after being named in lawsuit  Taco Boy spokesperson Melissa Reardon released a statement Wednesday afternoon on behalf of the restaurant stating that Komoroski was not in their restaurant and was not served alcohol there on the day of the fatal crash. The statement also denies there was any ‚Äúorganized employee function around drinking.‚Äù  Here is their full statement.  On the day of the accident, Friday, April 28, 2023, we can confirm with absolute certainty that Jamie Komoroski did not set foot in Taco Boy, nor did anyone on our team serve her alcohol at the restaurant. We have confirmed this by watching 16 hours of video footage from multiple cameras, staff interviews with everyone working that day, and by reviewing all sales receipts.  Miss Komoroski had been recently hired at Taco Boy and had trained for only two days prior to the accident. She passed her background check and there were no red flags that would indicate ineligibility for employment. She has since been terminated.  The lawsuit alleges an officially organized employee function around drinking, which we can assure there was no such thing.  We are committed to serving alcohol responsibly and take it very seriously for the safety of our staff and guests. We require that our employees ID everyone and our staff are all ServeSafe /TIPS alcohol training certified before they are allowed to serve guests. We take great care not to overserve anyone.  Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy. Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.  Authorities release BAC of alleged drunk driver in crash that killed newlywed  The toxicology report from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division states that Komoroski had a blood alcohol level of 0.261% when she was tested after the April 28 crash with a golf cart on Folly Beach. That is more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina.  Along with the toxicology report, the Folly Beach Police Department also sent an updated report of the incident.  Immediately after the crash, officers asked Komoroski what happened to which she replied, ‚ÄúI was driving, and then all the sudden something hit me,‚Äù the report reads.  Also, in the report, multiple witness recall seeing Komoroski ‚Äúdazed and confused.‚Äù At the scene, she kept asking for her boyfriend and telling the witnesses she was on her way home, the report states.  Once she saw the victims on the ground, Komoroski started screaming and asking what happened, witnesses say.  In Komoroski‚Äôs arrest affidavit, officers claim they could smell alcohol on her breath and person. She told officers she had a beer and a drink with tequila about an hour before the crash, the affidavit states.  When asked how she felt on a scale of one to ten, with one being completely sober and ten being the most impaired, she responded that she was at an eight, the affidavit states.  Komoroski was then asked to complete a field sobriety test but she refused, the affidavit states. However, her blood was sampled for the toxicology report.  Komoroski is charged with DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and reckless homicide. Police say she rear-ended a golf cart with her car in the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue.  At the time of the crash, Komoroski was driving 65 mph, according to police.  GoFundMe raises nearly $725,000  In a May 8 update from Hutchinson‚Äôs mother, Annette, on the GoFundMe page said he was recovering at home from multiple broken bones.  ‚ÄúFrom the accident, Aric received multiple injuries including two broken legs, one which had to be surgically repaired,‚Äù Hutchinson said on May 8. ‚ÄúBroken bones in his face which also had to be surgically repaired. Broken vertebrae in his back, brain bleeds, and numerous cuts with stitches. He is physically recovering at home while trying to come to terms with the loss of his beautiful wife. Now he is doing the unimaginable of planning Sam‚Äôs funeral along with her family.‚Äù  The lawsuit was also filed by the other two injured in the crash.  Copyright 2023 WCSC.

But the influencer is as calm as can be ahead of the big day. In fact, Tadhg has had great fun planning his and long-time girlfriend Alannah Bradley‚Äôs nuptials.  Today's top videos  It‚Äôs helped that Alannah is just as laid back as her soon-to-be husband. Speaking to EVOKE as he does the final checks ahead of tying the knot in Kerry, Tadhg could not praise his fianc√©e enough.  ‚ÄòAlannah is the opposite to a bridezilla, she‚Äôs very easy going and said ‚Äúwhatever you like, go for it‚Äù so I‚Äôve picked the flowers and the band. She went ‚Äúthat‚Äôs grand‚Äù and there‚Äôs been no stress and no panic,‚Äô he gushed.  Tadhg Fleming and fianc√©e Alannah. Pic: Supplied  He continued: ‚ÄòIt was gas actually, the girl who‚Äôs doing the flowers said to me ‚Äúit‚Äôs normally the bride and not the groom calling in‚Äù but this has worked perfectly for us.  'There‚Äôs only a couple of weeks to go now but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs butterflies more than nerves. It‚Äôs exciting but a little stressful at the same time because the list is never ending. But there‚Äôs no need to stress, you know who‚Äôs coming.'  Although Tadhg and Alannah have been together for over 10 years now, she‚Äôs very private and only makes rare appearances on his social media.  Tadhg jokes that Alannah is his ‚Äòbiggest critic as well as supporter‚Äô when it comes to posting online and that they‚Äôll be leaving the camera work to others at their wedding which has lots of nods to their personalities and shared love of animals.  Tadhg Fleming and fianc√©e Alannah. Pic: Supplied  ‚ÄòThe dogs are a massive part of our life - we've just got a new puppy two weeks before the wedding! And Otis helped me propose, he had on a little tux and the engagement ring was in a box on him, he was my wing man, so they‚Äôll be a big part of the day,‚Äô Tadhg said.  He added: 'The priest told us to make sure the day was about us as well and not all about the dogs but it wouldn't be our wedding without them.'  After the church service the couple are celebrating at The Dunloe Hotel and are using lots of local suppliers and people they know for their big day. For example, Tadhg‚Äôs aunty has offered to do the canopies and coffees.  And anyone who follows Tadhg on social media knows that his dad Derry loves to get involved so it‚Äôll come as no surprise he‚Äôs been very hands-on with the wedding planning.  Just recently a video of Derry on the kitchen floor trying to suss out the seating plan had thousands of Tadhg‚Äôs fans in stitches and anyone who‚Äôs ever tried to navigate family dynamics and feuds will relate.  Tadhg said: ‚ÄòMyself and my dad have had an input in everything. Alannah and I actually took our parents along to the food tasting with us, which was nice to have their opinions.‚Äô  Tadhg Fleming and fianc√©e Alannah. Pic: Supplied  When it comes to Derry‚Äôs role on the wedding day, he‚Äôll be making a father-of-the-groom speech and Tadhg knows one thing for sure - there‚Äôs going to be tears!  Derry told us he‚Äôs not overthinking the speech and will instead: ‚ÄòWing it and speak from the heart‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm an emotional person. It‚Äôs good to be in touch with your emotions.‚Äô  Tadhg Fleming and fianc√©e Alannah on a 78km Quest Run. Pic: Supplied  Quick to get a joke in, Tadhg quipped that Derry is a ‚Äòone man band‚Äô and family will have plenty of tissues on hand before teasing that they‚Äôll have to play the Oscar music to get his dad off the stage.  Although they jest, we just know that Derry's speech is going to inspire a few tears from others at the celebration.

In the video shared on the Tik Tok social platform, you can see and hear the mother of the bride reflecting and lamenting the sadness that the bride's father could not walk her down the aisle. Then, ""Dad"" makes his presence known.  In Louisiana, we would call that kind of moment a frisson moment. The kind of moment that gives us chills.

"wedding","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""SantaMonica"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:10:00","For many couples, what they'll wear on the actual wedding is usually the only fashion consideration they make when planning their upcoming nuptials. And while selecting a ceremony gown and tuxedo is an extremely important task, for those who are currently planning multiple events, there are several other outfits you need to consider. From what you'll wear to the engagement party and the rehearsal dinner to outfits for the bachelor or bachelorette party and post-wedding brunch, your complete wedding wardrobe is an opportunity to showcase your personal style and create a cohesive look from start to finish.  With all this in mind, it's normal to feel a lot of pressure when attempting to curate the ""perfect"" capsule wardrobe. Not only will you need to coordinate with your partner, but you also have to consider your personal aesthetics, each event's theme, where they'll be held, and the level of formality, among other things. Before you get completely overwhelmed, though, we'd like to highlight that these supplementary outfits provide you with the freedom to test out new fashions and reflect your status as the bride or groom. It's also your chance to incorporate pops of color, seasonal fabrics, or trending accessories that may not be suitable for your actual nuptials. Sounds fun, right?  Ahead, we spoke with two stylists for their expert advice on planning the ultimate wedding wardrobe. Here's everything you need to know, from when to buy your outfits to styling tips to remember.  Meet the Expert Hope LaVine is a bridal stylist based in Santa Monica, California. She‚Äôs also a content creator that provides brides with wedding inspiration and advice via her TikToks, quizzes, and Pinterest boards.  Raina Silberstein is a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper based in Los Angeles, California. She helps clients define their personal style and build a wardrobe for work, special events, and more.  PHOTOS BY ADRIANA RIVERA and REBECCA YALE PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Consider When Planning Your Wedding Wardrobe  Before you start shopping for your wedding wardrobe, both Rania Silberstein, a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper, and Hope LaVine, a bridal stylist, recommend deciding on an overall creative vision. That way, you can select outfits that complement the vibe of your events while also taking the season, level of formality, and event design into consideration. For instance, if you‚Äôre planning a party on the beach, ‚Äúan overall relaxed style may be best,"" Silberstein says. ""Opt for lightweight textiles like a linen suit or take cues from the coastal color palette. Planning a downtown city celebration? Neutrals and shine make a chic formula along with sleek silhouettes that mirror the architecture.‚Äù  Silberstein also advises couples to use their personal style and everyday wardrobe as inspiration. ‚ÄúIf you often choose bold styles in your wardrobe, forgo traditional options like a white gown or black tuxedo,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúI would avoid trying something entirely new and out of your personal comfort level, whether that is a color, pattern, texture, or silhouette.‚Äù That‚Äôs not to say you can‚Äôt experiment with your ensembles, but the key to creating a fantastic look is by bringing together fashion elements you already love with a few statement details.  Lastly, you‚Äôll want to think about wearability. ‚ÄúI would want to invest in high quality, gorgeous pieces that I would wear in new ways,‚Äù LaVine says. ‚ÄúI think your wedding wardrobe should be pretty interchangeable‚Äîa corset you wore for your bachelorette, then wear on a Friday date night with the spouse. I think if we invest in better quality pieces up front, then we will have it in our closet forever.‚Äù  PHOTO BY ADRIANA RIVERA; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  When to Buy Your Wedding Wardrobe  While it‚Äôs highly recommended that you buy a wedding dress or suit several months before the big day, the shopping timeline for your other celebrations isn't as restrictive. Specifically, Silberstein suggests that couples purchase their outfits in the same season as their events. ‚ÄúBy sourcing your outfit closer to the event date, you discover relevant styles, colors, and textiles for the time of year,‚Äù she notes. ‚ÄúResort styles may appeal for your summer tropical welcome party, while rich velvets are beautiful for a winter engagement event.‚Äù  She further notes that everyone should book their venue spaces before deciding on their outfits, as the location ‚Äúwill set the tone for the entire event from the design elements to the overall vibe. The wedding attire should complement the vision too.‚Äù Finally, once you‚Äôve secured dates for your events, Silberstein and LaVine both recommend finalizing your outfit about two to three weeks beforehand to allow for any potential outfit changes, alternations, and delayed shipping.  For the bride, LaVine suggests purchasing a wedding gown first before you focus on anything else. ‚ÄúAfter that, I like to switch back to more ‚Äòhigh stakes‚Äô looks like rehearsal dinner and reception (if there is a dress change),‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAfter securing those outfits, I tend to prioritize the bachelorette party looks last. They‚Äôre a little easier to buy for and have tons of options out there.‚Äù As for the groom, LaVine recommends that his look should not only compliment the event's aesthetic but should also pair well with the bride's attire‚Äîmeaning, the groom should purchase his outfits once everything else has been locked in.  How to Make Your Wedding Wardrobes Cohesive  A bride‚Äôs look tends to take top priority for most wedding events, but it‚Äôs important to put some thought into the groom‚Äôs pieces as well. Though being matchy-matchy isn‚Äôt the right choice for every couple, planning out looks together prevents any potential clashes and ensures complementary styles‚Äîthis is especially important when you consider how highly photographed all of these events will be. According to Silberstein, you should start by selecting adjectives that best describe your desired aesthetic to help guide your wardrobe choices. For example, ‚ÄúIf the special day is supposed to be fresh, bold, and relaxed, a whimsical floral dress and vibrant suit may be favorable,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBy following this unofficial dress code, the partners guarantee a cohesive, personalized, and special event wardrobe.‚Äù  LaVine also suggests couples adhere to the same level of formality, whether that‚Äôs black-tie or casual, and a similar color scheme. ‚ÄúWhen wearing white to the wedding events, you really want to match your whites down to the tone‚Äîcool white, warm white, or neutral white. And if the bride is in ivory, we definitely don‚Äôt want the groom in white or anything drastically different,‚Äù she explains. ""Pastels tend to be more casual, and jewel tones [feel] dressier. Neutrals work both ways, but it depends on the styling.‚Äù Aside from color, the experts go even further to share their top style suggestions for each event, as highlighted below.  For the Engagement Party  There‚Äôs no better way to show off your new relationship status than with an engagement party. Since this is the first of many wedding-related celebrations, LaVine suggests that brides keep their styles relaxed and playful. ‚ÄúI love a fun midi dress for a bride. It‚Äôs somewhere in between sophisticated and fun. Maybe the trim of the skirt has feathers, or the straps have pearls. For styling, you could also go with a fun shoe if your dress leans more simple,‚Äù she says. As for the groom, the stylist recommends going for an equally sophisticated look, like ‚Äúa well-tailored black trouser, nice t-shirt or polo, and a loafer.‚Äù And to tie both looks together, the groom should consider matching his shirt with the color of the bride's dress or shoes.  For the Bridal Shower  Bridal showers are typically daytime events, which means a light color palette, textured fabrics, and romantic silhouettes are all appropriate sartorial choices. Silberstein says, ‚ÄúIf the bride is attending a tea party event hosted by her family and friends, a white long-sleeve lace midi dress with nude ankle strap heels would be an elegant choice.‚Äù In this case, she also recommends advising guests to wear pastel hues to guarantee great photos and a cohesive theme. As for accessories, ‚ÄúThis would be such a special day to wear family heirloom pieces or something of sentimental value. Especially with all of your family around you,‚Äù she adds.  Though a groom‚Äôs appearance may be brief at this event, he should still dress in a complementary outfit. A button-down shirt and dress pants, in a similar color scheme or texture as the bride‚Äôs ensemble, would be perfect for this occasion.  PHOTOS BY KT MERRY AND LAUREN FAIR PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  For the Bachelor and Bachelorette Parties  Whether you‚Äôre having a joint celebration or separate events, get creative with your bachelor and bachelorette party ensembles. ‚ÄúThis is such a great time to play around with different styles and types of looks,‚Äù LaVine notes. ‚ÄúFor my brides, I love seeing some different pieces like a blazer dress, a jumpsuit, or a two-piece set. We can get super creative here and have fun.‚Äù She also notes that brides can include at least one statement piece, like ""a fun heel wrap-up, feathers, or bows.‚Äù For the groom, LaVine recommends trying out different fabrics, opting for linen pants over jeans, or a leather jacket instead of a blazer. ‚ÄúObviously, grooms don‚Äôt typically try and wear white their whole bachelor trip, but you can still stand out with something fun, like a floral or a chic neutral-on-neutral look,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúCream jeans and a cream t-shirt make for a very versatile outfit that can be worn for any bachelor trip moment.‚Äù  Planning a themed night out? Add some playful corresponding details to your look. For instance, if you‚Äôre hosting a bachelorette weekend in Nashville, Silberstein says, ‚ÄúThe bride can wear a white denim jacket and white denim mini skirt, set along with white cowboy boots to walk down Broadway in style.""  For the Welcome Party  If you‚Äôre planning a wedding outside of your city, it‚Äôs common practice to host a welcome party for your guests. And since this is the first time you can really shine a light on your bridal and groom fashions, stick to silhouettes and color palettes that complement your venue or event theme. What's more, LaVine advises couples to embrace a casual dress code, as a welcome party is ‚Äúa raw, stripped-down time to just show the couple and their love.‚Äù  She loves the idea of a bride in a maxi gown paired with a soft beauty look and the groom in a coordinating outfit, which may include a ‚Äúquality khaki or cream pant and white button down, slightly unbuttoned, with a beautiful brown loafer.‚Äù Remember to be mindful of the season, though, as some colder months may call for longer hemlines and thicker fabrics.  For the Rehearsal Dinner  The rehearsal dinner is another opportunity to preview your wedding aesthetics. ‚ÄúThis night is truly connected to the next day, so I like to incorporate small elements of the bridal look into the wedding look,‚Äù LaVine says. ‚ÄúFor example, if your bridal gown has lace on it, it would be really interesting to have a simple gown and add a touch of lace through a glove or long sleeve.‚Äù She also suggests that brides opt for an ‚Äúeffortless, yet put together‚Äù outfit that perfectly blends their bridal status with their personal style. Some elegant options include a floor-length gown, an embellished midi dress, or a satin jumpsuit.  Although the bride commonly wears white on this night, there's no reason why the groom can't consider a more colorful look. Whether that‚Äôs adding a navy jacket on top of a white button-down or donning a jewel-tone suit, the bolder color scheme will make a bride‚Äôs white ensemble pop even more. As for accessories, LaVine says that the groom can keep it simple, opting for no tie, no vest, and leaving the top few buttons of his shirt open for a formal yet relaxed look.  For the Farewell Brunch  After a late night of celebrating their nuptials, many couples will prefer a slightly more casual dress code at their post-wedding brunch. While the attire for this event can vary, you‚Äôll want to prioritize comfort and opt for a look that's functional yet stylish. ‚ÄúFor my brides, I always recommend comfort here! Whether that‚Äôs a chic bridal short and lace top, a jumpsuit, or a silk flow slip dress,‚Äù LaVine says. For the groom, attire suggestions also fall into the relaxed category. She suggests ‚Äúa linen pant and button down, or floral or lace fun shirt with a quality jean‚Äù for a simple look that still feels wedding-worthy.  Additionally, Silberstein recommends that couples ‚Äúbegin their marriage in a matching monochrome color palette.‚Äù White or neutrals are typically the favored option, but consider incorporating a seasonal color into both of your outfits for a statement look that's still cohesive. Jewel-tone hues, like dark purple, burgundy, or forest green, are excellent choices for a fall or winter event, while spring and summer call for pastel colors like light pink, sky blue, or yellow.

Dottie Fideli was one of those girls and has been dreaming of her ultimate wedding day her entire life.  Now at age 77 she's said 'sod it' to waiting around for a man and has married herself in the ultimate act of self-love at her Ohio retirement home.  Speaking to NBC local affiliate WLWT5, the grandmother revealed she finally had the chance to have the wedding she had always dreamed of.  Advert 10  ""This is something I‚Äôve always wanted,"" she said.  ""I wanted to get married and have a happy life but things didn‚Äôt work out that way and now I have a second chance in doing something that‚Äôll make me happy.""  Credit: Donna Pennington  ""I told my daughter, I said, ‚ÄòThis is the best thing that I‚Äôve ever had, outside of having you kids',"" told the Today show.  Advert 10  Ms Fideli had been married once before, back in 1965.  But the ill-fated nuptials were never meant to be.  After she and her ex-husband exchanged vows at a courthouse, 'he went to work and I went home'.  ""I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,"" she revealed.  Advert 10  But she had always dreamed of having her own 'big wedding', but was dismayed at the idea it was 'too late' for her.  Her daughter, Donna Pennington, was determined to make her mother's dreams come true.  They set about decorating the community room of O‚ÄôBannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, with balloons and her daughter cooked all of the food.  Family, friends, and loved ones turned out to see Fideli in her dream white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt.  Advert 10  She also wore a white veil with an embellished headband.

But, when the sun set on her dream wedding day, she ended up 'really happy' after marrying herself.  Advert 10  In her hand as she said her vows to herself, she held a white lily as a symbol for self-love.  ""I said, 'Everybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they‚Äôre happy and everything‚Äôs going to be hunky-dory, but they don‚Äôt consider the inside, the little petals inside',"" she told Today.

With all of the major to-dos checked off your list, you may be wondering what's left to be done. While floral arrangements and seating charts may be top of mind, don‚Äôt forget about the reason this all began in the first place: your engagement ring! Prepping your wedding jewelry‚Äîyour engagement ring and both wedding bands‚Äîis an important but often overlooked step in the getting-ready process; just as you were diligent about ensuring that your diamond or colorful gemstone looked its best in your engagement photos, you should extend that same level of care for your jewelry in the days before you say ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere are likely many wedding guests who will see your rings for the first time on your wedding day so they need to be on point,‚Äù shares Sharon Schatner, GIA Diamond Graduate at Filigree Jewelers. ‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs not forget about your wedding pictures. Your rings will be highlighted in those forever photos so they need to look perfect.‚Äù  Meet the Expert Easter Ahn-Lee is a fine jewelry and engagement ring designer, and the founder of the jewelry brand Easter Ahn Design.  Sharon Schatner is a GIA diamond graduate and self-proclaimed ""rock nerd"" at Filigree Jewelers in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  That's why it's so important to properly care for your special pieces ahead of the big day. To take the guesswork out of caring for your wedding jewelry‚Äîand ensuring they're in the best possible condition on the day you say ""I do""‚Äîwe created a timeline that outlines exactly what you need to do and when, from the moment you get engaged to the day you tie the knot. Follow the expert advice of Schatner and Easter Ahn-Lee, a fine jewelry and engagement ring designer, and your rings will be ready for their wedding debut.  Photo by Valorie Darling; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  As Soon as Possible: Get Your Ring Resized  Before we dive into the specifics, if your wedding rings don't fit your finger the way you'd like, be sure to have them resized as soon as possible. ‚ÄúI would recommend having your ring resized right away, whether it's too big or small,‚Äù says Ahn-Lee. What's more, while weight loss shouldn't be a priority on your to-do list, Ahn-Lee further notes that ‚Äúfor couples who lose weight before the wedding day, I would recommend resizing the wedding bands to fit a few weeks before the wedding day so there isn't a significant change to ring size.‚Äù  One Year Out: Establish Your Budget  When establishing a comprehensive wedding budget, make sure you account for your wedding bands‚Äîwhile they're not as pricey of a line item as catering, for example, knowing how much you have to spend allows you to better consider your options. ‚ÄúYour wedding jewelry is usually part of your wedding budget, so it is also helpful to know how much you plan on spending,‚Äù explains Ahn-Lee. ‚ÄúYou'll also need time to research and plan your [pieces] if you are doing any custom jewelry work.‚Äù Start saving photos of ring stacks and individual bands you like in order to share them with your partner and jeweler when shopping.  Planning on wearing earrings, a bracelet, or a necklace alongside your bands? Consider whether you want to purchase those items, or if you‚Äôre borrowing them from family members, and include that in your budget. And if those borrowed items need to be cleaned, bring them along on your next trip to the jeweler.  Six Months Out: Take Your Engagement Ring in for a Checkup  About six months before you say ""I do,"" visit your jeweler for a quick ring checkup. This is also a great time to ask questions about how to best care for your rock while at home. ‚ÄúGeneral knowledge on how to care for and protect your jewelry will help maintain its beauty,‚Äù says Ahn-Lee. Lastly, while we highly recommend this step ahead of the wedding, you should continue to get your ring examined on a regular basis and add it to your routine for years to come. ‚ÄúA half-yearly to yearly checkup is also recommended to ensure the stones are secure and prongs, links, clasps, and settings are in good condition,"" Ahn-Lee adds.    Photo by Rachel Rodgers Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Three to Four Months Out: Buy Your Wedding Bands  It's generally recommended that you choose your wedding bands at least three to four months before the wedding, and Schatner adds that couples should buy their bands no later than one month before the big day. When selecting your bands, make it a day-long event with your partner and schedule time to grab breakfast or lunch, then head to the jeweler to try on those all-important pieces. As for who picks up the tab for the rings? That all depends! If you want to purchase your partner‚Äôs band and they yours, that's great, but it‚Äôs certainly not a requirement. ‚ÄúSince wedding bands are generally part of the wedding budget, the couple can discuss how they want to purchase them,‚Äù explains Ahn-Lee. ‚ÄúThere is no right or wrong way on who should be buying them.‚Äù  Finally, once your rings are ready, Schatner advises couples to pick them up together so the jeweler can make sure they're a perfect fit. ‚ÄúIf an alteration needs to be made, you can leave it with the jeweler, saving yourself time and an extra trip.‚Äù  About a Week Out: Get Your Rings Cleaned  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ideal to get your rings cleaned as close to the day of the wedding as possible, so they are at their sparkling best for your special day,‚Äù says Schatner. ‚ÄúYour jeweler is happy to clean your rings for you, and when we clean them we also check for loose stones or lifted prongs.‚Äù If you're having them cleaned a week out, you may want to store your jewelry in a ring box rather than wear it; if going a week without your precious rock feels unimaginable, be sure to remove it whenever cooking, cleaning, working out, or applying makeup, sunscreen, or moisturizer, thus ensuring it remains clean and shiny ahead of the wedding. If you're nervous about keeping it pristine, see if your jeweler can send you home with a convenient cleaning pen for on-the-spot touchups or else try to squeeze in a cleaning appointment closer to the wedding date.  Photo by Leah Marie Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Avoid  In the lead-up to your wedding day, it's important to be extra careful with your jewelry, and when in doubt, take it off. ‚ÄúTo protect their jewelry and reduce the risk of damage before the wedding day, a couple should avoid impact on hard surfaces, gripping items with force, or applying strong pressure to jewelry or hands when jewelry is worn, such as when working out or performing physical labor,‚Äù shares Ahn-Lee. ‚ÄúAvoid harsh chemicals such as chlorine and household bleach and everyday substances such as lotion, hairspray, and perfume.‚Äù  If you‚Äôre concerned about potentially damaging your band or stone before the big day, consider taking your ring off as soon as you get home. Keep a small dish near the sink so you remember to remove it when washing dishes, and designate a spot in the bathroom and bedroom so your precious jewels are in a secure place when you‚Äôre not wearing them.

(Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky/Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky)  The war in Ukraine has made its culture more precious than ever, especially traditions that might become lost after the smoke clears. One of Ukraine‚Äôs unique cultural gems involves the music and customs that accompany a traditional wedding. You can hear these evocative songs in ‚ÄúA Ukrainian Wedding,‚Äù which will be performed by the women of Cappella Romana with guest Ukrainian singers.  The program is curated by Nadia Tarnawsky, a professional singer and folklorist who gives workshops on Ukrainian music throughout the nation.  ‚ÄúI grew up speaking Ukrainian as a first language,‚Äù said Tarnawsky, ‚ÄúMy father came to Cleveland, Ohio during World War II, and my mother was born in the U.S. Her family came here from Ukraine in the late Nineteenth Century with the first wave of immigrants.‚Äù  HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok  Tarnawsky has a bachelors in music education from Case Western Reserve University, where she has also pursued a masters in ethnomusicology. From 2017 to 2018, she spent 10 months in Ukraine on a Fulbright Scholarship to study its folk music and traditions.  During that time, Tarnawsky traveled with Inna Kovtun, artistic director of the Kyiv-based ensemble Rozhanytsia, to villages where they learned and recorded songs. Since the war started in Ukraine last year, Kovtun has moved to Portland with her daughter. Her husband remains in Ukraine.  ‚ÄúIt is important to get these songs,‚Äù said Kovtun. ‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt that many people who remember all of the verses. Now there are even fewer people because of the war. Nadia and I just listened to them. These are old songs, but I can learn the melody after hearing it one time. The music speaks to my soul.‚Äù  Because most of the wedding music is sung by the women of the villages, the concert will feature the women of Cappella Romana plus Tarnawsky, Kovtun, and Hanna Tischenko, who is also a professional folk singer from Ukraine now living as a refugee in Chicago.  The Cappella Romana program draws from wedding folk songs that are not from a particular region of Ukraine, but from all around the country.  ‚ÄúIn general, wedding music has specific songs that happen at specific times,‚Äù said Tarnawsky. ‚ÄúWhen the matchmakers come to your house, there‚Äôs a song that you sing. When you make the wedding bread called the korovai. It is a yeasty bread, and they did it on ‚ÄòThe Great British Baking Show.‚Äô You sing about what goes in the bread and how you make it. There are songs about dressing the bride and groom. There is a song about the girl on her last night as an unmarried woman. Songs about making the wreaths that go on their heads. Songs about what to expect when the bride moves into the man‚Äôs household, which meant living with the mother-in-law and father-in-law.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWeddings are held on Sundays,‚Äù added Tarnawsky. ‚ÄúOn Mondays the bride‚Äôs friends would have farewell breakfast with her and sing these lamentations. There would be songs about how she is not a member of their group anymore. Sometimes she would have to leave the village, and they wouldn‚Äôt see her again.‚Äù  The second half of the program features music that is usually sung during the wedding ceremony.  ‚ÄúAlthough the church wedding music is not exactly folk in style,‚Äù explained Tarnawsky, ‚ÄúI opted to use compositions from composers who were inspired by folk traditions, along with widely known Kyivan chant versions, and pieces which use the liturgical tones. They will be in a more standard, Slavic style.‚Äù  Tarnawsky also mentioned that there are other songs that are sung after the wedding, but those songs won‚Äôt be part of the concert.  ‚ÄúSome songs have a lot of double-entendre meanings and are racy,‚Äù explained Tarnawsky, ‚ÄúAnd there are a number of songs that remind me of Appalachian murder ballads. They are kind of dark in a similar way.‚Äù  But she did talk about one folk song that is done at every wedding.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a song about two doves that love each other very much,‚Äù said Tarnawsky. ‚ÄúThey have a nest on the side of a mountain. An eagle comes in and kills the male dove and scoops up the female. He takes the female home where he has a whole bunch of doves in cages. He gives her plenty of food and water, but she is unhappy. She just wants to weep and return to the mountain to the place where she was with the male dove. He offers her other male doves, but she rejects them, complaining that their down is not right, and they don‚Äôt have the right voice when they coo.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI thought that it was a depressing song,‚Äù continued Tarnawsky, ‚Äúand I asked why is it sung as part of a wedding. A sweet grandmother replied ‚ÄòLook at how true her love is. She will love him forever even when he is no longer there. Why wouldn‚Äôt you sing this at a wedding.‚Äô‚Äù  That song, unfortunately, has even more meaning in light of the current situation in Ukraine.  8 p.m. Saturday, May 20, St. Mary‚Äôs Cathedral, 1739 N.W.

Now, the group is preparing for another royal wedding: Crown Prince Hussein‚Äôs nuptials to Rajwa Al-Saif, which is expected to take place on June 1, 2023. In the latest update on May 15, 2023, The Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman revealed the expected wedding dress code, and it appears to ditch one key accessory that epitomizes royalty. When a fan asked about the attire for the affair via Twitter, Salman responded, ‚ÄúMore like black tie, long dress but no tiaras.‚Äù The royal blogger never clarified whether the ‚Äúno tiara‚Äù rule applies to the bride, however.  Handout / Getty Images  The Twitter thread began with Salman confirming that Queen Azizah of Malaysia and her husband, King Abdullah, will attend the crown prince‚Äôs wedding. Many other royals around the world will also make an appearance. According to Hello!, the guest list will include Princess Hisakoa and Princess Tsuguko of Japan, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.  On May 14, 2023, the Royal Hashemite Court revealed the official logo for Hussein‚Äôs big day, which is an Arabic symbol topped with a crown. ‚ÄúAs the date of the wedding of HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif nears, we are pleased to share the official logo to mark the occasion, which is Arabic for ‚Äòwe rejoice,‚Äô‚Äù the court tweeted, along with a clip of the graphic. The post even mentioned a hashtag for the special day, which is #CelebratingAlHussein.  The Royal Hashemite Court first announced the crown prince‚Äôs wedding date back in December of 2022, but the entity has kept many of the other details a secret. ""The Royal Hashemite Court is pleased to announce that the wedding of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II and Miss Rajwa Khalid Al Saif will take place on June 1, 2023,‚Äù the court released in a statement. ‚ÄúThe Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah on this occasion and wishes His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bun Abdullah II and Miss Raja Khalid Al Said a lifetime of happiness #Jordan.‚Äù  To share the news, the royal court shared a photo of the couple posing together, with the bride-to-be in a white dress with puff sleeves and the future groom in a dark suit. The day is a special one for the future newlyweds because Hussein‚Äôs parents, Queen Rania and King Abdullah II, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary a little over a week later, on June 10, 2023, Tatler reports.  The couple first announced their engagement on August 18, 2022. ‚ÄúWe pray that God grants us His blessings,‚Äù Hussein wrote on his Instagram account. ‚ÄúGrateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes.‚Äù The future king of Jordan also uploaded a snap of himself and his soon-to-be wife, and her diamond ring is on full display in the photo. According to Tatler, Hussein popped the question at Rajwa‚Äôs father‚Äôs home, and his parents were also present to witness the proposal.

"wedding","2023-05-06","10:00:00","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 13:02:05","Choosing your wedding hairstyle is a task that seems like it should be simple, but most brides-to-be would agree that it can be surprisingly difficult to navigate. After all, this is going to be one of the most photographed days of your entire life, so your final look will be on full display for years to come. In addition to considering which type of hairstyle will best suit your wedding style, location, and dress, you'll also need to think about how you envision yourself as bride: Do you want your hair styled into soft, romantic waves that skim across your back, or do you prefer the look of a polish, elegant updo?  As it turns out, you don't need to choose just one hairstyle for your big day. According to hairstylist Jill Buck, the creative behind Hayley Erbert's two stunning cover story hairstyles, a mid-party swap is not only entirely feasible, but it's actually easy to achieve if your pro has prepped your hair properly. Here, she shares her tips for long-lasting nuptial hairstyles and advice on how to change up your look during the wedding.  For soft waves that last all day, start with the right base.  Buck stresses the importance of ensuring that your hairdresser has enough time to prep your hair; ask how long they'd need in an ideal world and build your morning-of timeline around that. ""For brides, I like to really take time in the prep of the hair. It needs to last all day and often there isn‚Äôt time to reset any curls on such a busy day,"" she says. ""I start on wet hair with Joico‚Äôs K-Pak Luster Lock Spray (for heat protection) and then Joi Whip Design Foam (for structure and hold)."" Then, she gives the hair a ""nice, full blowout"" and curls the entire head using a 1 1/4"" curling iron (Buck likes the T3 Micro). ""Using the bigger iron helps the waves to be a little softer than a traditional Hollywood glam look,"" she explains.  Hayley's soft waves require two additional steps: For that soft, touchable look, Buck says she finishes the curls with a Mason Pierson boar bristle brush and locks the shape in place with Joico‚Äôs JoiMist hairspray.    Be sure to choose your most flattering side for a part.  If there's one piece of advice Buck wants to give all brides-to-be, it's that you should over-communicate your preferred ""side"" so that your stylist can part your hair accordingly. ""There is nothing more frustrating than setting a look only to find you have to switch the part!"" she says. Plus, you wouldn't want to end up with a hairstyle that doesn't feel like ""you,"" and parting your hair in a way you've never done before almost always ends in that result.  And don't forget to consider what best suits your wedding dress.  Another pro tip from Buck? During your hair trial, be sure to show your hairstylist a photo of your wedding dress. ""The dress neckline is always my starting point, too,"" she explains. ""You don‚Äôt want the hair and dress in competition; they should complement one another.""  If the hair was properly set, changing to an updo should be a breeze.  The beauty of Buck's method? Taking the hair from soft, flowing waves into a structured updo is an extremely straightforward process. ""After my initial set the hair is in perfect condition to put into an updo. I don‚Äôt like to use an iron after hairspray so your brush is going to be the best tool for changing the shape,"" she explains. How did she bring Hayley's look up in a flash? ""On a sleek center part I brushed her hair into two ponytails one on top of the other. This helps give me control of how sleek I can get it as well as a good anchor to set the updo and place the Bobby pins. Mini rubber bands, different Bobby pin sizes, and firm hairspray are all good tools to have.""  And if you want to go the other direction? Just be clear about your plans during your first hair trial. It's certainly not impossible to go from an updo to a long, loose hairstyle, but you'll likely need to do some touchups once pins and rubber bands come out, and your stylist may want to use a softer, more flexible hairspray on your initial updo than they otherwise would.  Decide if going from hair down to an updo‚Äîor vice versa‚Äîmakes the most sense for your day.  According to Buck, brides tend to choose updos for more formal events or for the more traditional portion of the day, so most women prefer to star with their hair up and then bring it down. That being said, there's a real benefit to going in the other direction: By the time the party starts and you're ready to dance, having your hair up and out of your face might be exactly what you want. You'll have taken your beautiful portraits with long, flowing hair, and now you can stay cool and look fresh throughout the party.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vaG93LXJlY3JlYXRlLWhheWxleS1lcmJlcnQtY292ZXItaGFpci03MjU1NjM50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Rebecca Nguyen Sanchez/Facebook  Rebecca Nguyen was wearing a beautiful classic lace gown adorned with beading and spaghetti straps when she married the love of her life in August 2017. In the years since, the dress has acted as a reminder of the magical day.  ""When I wore it, I felt like me,"" Nguyen said. ""I want to say I felt like this movie star. I felt like this princess, but that wasn't me. I felt like me.""  The memories of that dream quickly turned into a nightmare on Tuesday, when she received the shock of her life, learning that her dress was suddenly missing.  ""My wedding dress was accidentally donated by one of my family members. It was a complete accident, it was during a rush of a lot of things,"" she said while speaking with KCAL News on Wednesday. ""Mistakes happen. When I found out yesterday I was pretty heartbroken.""  Nguyen says that the dress wasn't the only wedding souvenir that got donated to a Goodwill in Brea more than two weeks ago, and she immediately submitted an accidental donation form in hopes of retrieving what she could.  She's visited Goodwill's Orange County headquarters, hoping that some of the employees could help her recover the lost items.  ""It could be sitting at the warehouse, still waiting to get sorted through,"" said Chris Sewitsky, the retail director at the location. ""It just depends where and what time of day it came in. That store is a very busy store. Some stuff does stay at that store, some stuff comes back to main distribution. So, we're hoping we can find it because it is such a unique item.""  On top of her local search, Nguyen has also posted on several local Facebook pages offering to buy back the dress if it's already been purchased.  ""If you have it, please consider selling it back to me. I will pay more than you paid for it. You can even wear it for your wedding! I don't mind sharing the joy and beauty of the dress,"" one post says.  If someone does have it, she's hopeful that they're able to get as much enjoyment out of their special day as she did.  ""Not everybody can afford to get a brand new dress and that's okay. I want someone to be able to enjoy it as well,"" Nguyen said.

""Picking wedding d√©cor and fashion can be daunting, especially if you want your wedding to feel timeless,"" shares wedding planner Dani Blasena of HauteF√™tes. ""While Instagram and Pinterest are wonderful for inspiration, they often promote the same trending ideas over and over again. In contrast, a timeless wedding is one that stands the test of time and style!"" So, if you want to plan a timeless ceremony and reception, it's best to choose color palettes, fashion, and d√©cor that will still feel relevant in 20 years.  It's important to remember that timeless weddings can take many forms, so don't shy away from the style out of fear of planning a cookie cutter celebration. You can still infuse the day with plenty of personality. ""For me, what makes a wedding timeless is not about following the most current wedding trends or guidelines but about creating a celebration that genuinely reflects a couple's unique love story and values,"" notes wedding photographer Jenny Fu. ""It's about making an impact that lasts long after the day.""  Meet the Expert Dani Blasena is the owner, creative director and lead designer of HauteF√™tes.  Jenny Fu is a New York-based wedding photographer.  Jacqueline Hallgarth is the founder of wedding and event planning company Jacqueline Hallgarth Events.  If you're hoping to plan a timeless wedding that feels right for you and your spouse-to-be, we asked wedding pros to share their favorite details. Ahead, 20 ideas you can make your own.  Photo by KT Merry; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose a Classic Destination  ‚ÄúVenue selection is one of the most important aspects of creating a timeless wedding,‚Äù shares planner Jacqueline Hallgarth. If you know you want to tie the knot far from home, consider a locale that's steeped in history. ‚ÄúYou and your guests will be linked forever through this selection, so choose carefully,"" she adds. ""A destination wedding, held in historic villa in Italy or chateau in France, will not only be beautiful on your wedding day, but will also create timeless memories shared by you and all your guests. Regardless of the specific venue, beautiful memories can be created anywhere with the right elements.‚Äù  Photo by Caroline Tran; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Pick an Estate-Style Venue  Modern art galleries and open warehouses are incredible blank slates, but they're not the best choices for timeless celebrations. ‚ÄúChoosing an estate-style venue that is classic in architecture and will create a backdrop for your big day that is as relevant in 20 years‚Äô time as it is today,‚Äù advises Blasena. ‚ÄúMy favorites include Rosewood Miramar Beach for a classic Hamptons style on the West Coast replete with boxwoods and white siding. Abroad, the Belmond San Michele with views for days, classic Italian-style spaces and gardens that are breathtaking. Both venues have everything you need to make your big day truly timeless from start to finish.‚Äù  Photo by Will Reid Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Black-Tie Dress Code  What your guests wear will have an impact on the overall feel of your celebration, so picking the right attire style is important. ‚ÄúBy requesting black-tie and formal attire, you automatically create an elevated style that translates into forever cherished photographs,‚Äù shares Hallgarth. ""Floor-length gowns and black tuxedos never go out of fashion and when captured together, creates that timeless look everyone wants from their wedding.‚Äù  Photo by Volvoreta; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose Greenery and White Florals  When picking out your floral design, you can never go wrong with classic white blooms and lots of lush greenery. Blasena says, ‚ÄúGreen and white flowers are both classic and neutral and will never overwhelm a design.‚Äù  Photo by Stephanie Sunderland; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace a Soft Color Palette  Punchy colors might be trending, but are you sure you'll love Barbie pink or neon green for years to come? If the answer isn't a resounding ""yes!"" it's likely not the best choice. ‚ÄúA soft color palette is always a good rule of thumb,"" notes Blasena. ""Something like a French blue or classic taupe is always sophisticated and elegant. Pick two to three soft colors that suit your style best and keep it simple.‚Äù  Photo by Ryan Ray; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire the Right Wedding Photographer  You could plan a big day that's entirely timeless, but if you hire a photographer with a trendy, of-the-moment aesthetic, your photos might not stand the test of time. ""To truly capture the timeless essence of a wedding, it's crucial to work with an experienced photographer who can document your day,‚Äù shares Fu. ‚ÄúThe photographs they capture will be a lasting reminder of the love and joy you shared on your wedding day.‚Äù Blasena adds, ‚ÄúA photographer with a classic editing style, natural color tones, and graceful composition will create photographs never go out of style.‚Äù  Photo by Lev Kuperman; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  And Don't Shy Away from Candid Photos  While traditional wedding portraits are essential, some couples avoid candids out of fear of looking too modern. Whatever you do, get this idea out of your head. ""Candid wedding photographs have the power to capture the true essence and emotion of your wedding day,"" says Fu. ""Let the genuine connections and meaningful moments shine‚Äìthese moments are timeless because you've lived the experience, and the candid photographs can take you back long after the day has passed.""  Photo by Henry + Mac; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Wear Classic Wedding Attire  Fashion trends come and go, even in the world of weddings. ‚ÄúOne of the most important elements of your wedding is your dress,‚Äù says Blasena. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to get caught up in all the amazing wedding fashion there is today with designers from all over the world. To avoid looking back in horror, think timeless and classic in the cut; a soft ivory versus a stark white; and, avoid overcomplicating the style with unnecessary embellishments such as beading, tulle, or lace. Remember, less is always more!‚Äù  Photo by Lisa Poggi; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have Musicians at Your Ceremony  Acoustic versions of your favorite romantic songs can bring an emotional elegance and set the proper tone for your wedding ceremony. Consider hiring a string trio or a classical guitarist to play as you walk down the aisle.  Photo by Benjamin Wheeler and Ben Higgins; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Close Out the Ceremony With a Flower Petal Toss  Add an extra dose of joy and ensure excellent photos of your ceremony exit by having guests toss flower petals over your heads as you recess down the aisle as newlyweds.  Photo By Twah Dougherty; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Decorate With Chinoiserie  A classic d√©cor choice for a wedding is to bring chinoiserie ceramics into your design. Used as vessels for your florals or in your dinnerware, it adds a traditional and elegant touch to the space.  Photo by Haley Rynn Ringo; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Champagne Tower  Serving Champagne is a classic choice for a wedding. Serve your favorite bubbly in coupes, stacked in a tower, to make for an extra celebratory (and photo-worthy) moment at your reception.  Photo by AGP Collective; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Up a Checkered Dance Floor  A checkered dance floor is a classic for a reason. It sets the tone for the reception and brings a retro elegance as you get down with your new spouse and guests.  Photo by Corbin Gurkin; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace Candlelight  ‚ÄúWhether it‚Äôs dinner for two or a wedding for 250, candlelight creates an intimate atmosphere which can transform any space,‚Äù shares Blasena. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing more magical than a candlelit room to create romance. Adding clusters of pillar and votive candles or simple white taper candles to your tabletop is an inexpensive touch that will also never go out of style.‚Äù  Photo by An√©e Atelier; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Opt for Black-and-White Photos  Don‚Äôt forget to ask your photographer to edit some shots without color. ‚ÄúBlack and white photography is classic, timeless, and elegant. It creates a sophisticated look that will never go out of style,‚Äù says Fu.  Photo by Jenny Fu; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Consider Seasonal Shades  ‚ÄúFeaturing seasonal colors in the floral, stationery, tabletop and event design creates an event that resonates with guests emotions and ties your wedding to a place in time,‚Äù shares Hallgarth. ""I always encourage bright and colorful blooms for a spring wedding and autumnal florals and foliage for a fall wedding which captures not only the beauty of the moment, but forever marries the event to a specific feeling of the year.‚Äù  Photo by Brooke Miller Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Getaway Car  After you say ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù there‚Äôs nothing more timeless than speeding off into the sunset with your new spouse. Find a vintage car and adorn it with florals for a charming getaway for the newlyweds as they head to the reception.  Photo by Sasithon Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Make a Grand Entrance  As the wedding reception begins, have a special moment where the emcee announces the bride and groom for the first time as they rush out onto the dance floor. The entrance is a fun and celebratory moment that can easily transition to the first dance, and it's something that's been done at weddings for decades.  Photo by Allan Zepeda Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire a Live Band  While choosing a DJ or band for your wedding is a personal decision for a couple, there's no denying that live musicians can be an absolutely classic addition to your celebration. Make sure to do research to have your band fit the style and song selection you want for the evening.  Photo By Tailor James; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Leave With a Sparkler Exit  At the end of the evening (or before you head to the after party), have your guests line up for a sparkler send-off. It's a beautiful end to celebrations around those you love.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vdGltZWxlc3Mtd2VkZGluZy1pZGVhcy03MjU1NjU20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The comments were mostly positive, although some questioned whether staff were properly compensated.  In a follow-up video, Mulkey said she tipped the staff ‚Äî though some users still raise doubts.

The response was generally positive, with many applauding the idea and saying they wished they had thought of it themselves.  She also received curious questions and some criticism about whether it imposed extra work on her wedding staff, which prompted her to make a follow-up video saying that she tipped all service workers involved. Despite her attempted clarification, some viewers were unconvinced and alleged that she deleted a previous comment saying she hadn't tipped them.  Still, the apparent hack has inspired others to think more creatively about wedding food ‚Äî so as long as restaurant and ceremony workers are properly compensated.  Mulkey did not immediately respond to multiple requests from Insider for comment.  Madison Mulkey, a photographer with over 28,000 TikTok followers, posted a video on Sunday explaining why she chose the restaurant chain Chili's for her wedding food.  She said the main attraction was the low cost ‚Äî $1,950 for 99 guests. The food included chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, and salad. According to The Knot, the average price for traditional wedding catering can cost $75 a guest, which for Mulkey, amounted to nearly $7,500 total.  She said there were some unexpected complications that arose because they didn't want to pay the delivery fee ‚Äî which would have been $300, she said in a comment. They threw their wedding on St. Patrick's Day weekend, and the restaurant was packed, so they had to pick up the food early at 11 a.m. and keep it cool before the service which was at 6 p.m.  Normally, Chili's workers would deliver and set it up, Mulkey said. But since they picked the food up directly from the restaurant, her hired servers ‚Äî who were mostly hired for cleaning, she said ‚Äî were forced to do a lot of the food preparations. She added that her coordinator helped them.  ""Everyone made it work, thank goodness,"" Mulkey said in the clip, which has been viewed over 1.3 million times. ""Our situation was rare. I'm sure if you order from Chili's in any other regard they would serve it and it would all be so hassle-free.""  The reaction was mostly positive, with people saying they would be excited to find out a wedding they attended was serving Chili's, and that society should normalize scaled-down weddings like this.  ""I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was chili's,"" a top comment with over 7,000 likes said. ""This is my dream,"" someone else wrote.  The official Chili's Grill & Bar TikTok account even left a comment calling the video ""iconic.""  However, some people worried that Mulkey's wedding staffers were forced to take on more work.  ""I'm all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,"" one top comment with over 1,600 likes said. ""You should have paid for delivery.""  A comment with over 2,200 likes said they'd give the poster an ""A for creativity"" but critiqued that the food was 7 hours old, which probably stressed the staff out.  The concerns for her staff prompted Mulkey to make a follow-up video. She assured viewers that she tipped the Chili's kitchen staff $300, and tipped the coordinator and the servers on top of their hourly payment.  ""All they did was make the food, help the buffet run efficiently, and then clean up,"" Mulkey said of the servers. ""I didn't ask anyone to work outside of their bounds or their means.""  Viewers, however, did not seem entirely convinced. Several comments on the follow-up video accused her of deleting a comment from her original viral video where they said she told another user she hadn't tipped anyone extra since it was included in their original payment (Insider was unable to find and verify the original comment).  Someone also claimed that Chili's managers aren't able to receive tips which prompted them to ask how she was able to tip them. (Insider could not independently verify this but has reached out to the company for comment.)  ""Maybe they didn't take it, I have no idea what they did with it,"" Mulkey wrote in response. ""We gave chilis a lump sum.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL2JyaWRlLXdlZGRpbmctc2VydmVkLWNoaWxpcy1mb29kLW5vLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWZlZS0yMDIzLTXSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9icmlkZS13ZWRkaW5nLXNlcnZlZC1jaGlsaXMtZm9vZC1uby1kZWxpdmVyeS1mZWUtMjAyMy01P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Weddings in space are now a thing and we heard it is truly out of this world.  If the thought of nuptials on Earth sound common and boring, a space travel company wants to give you the chance to get hitched at a venue looking down on the third rock from the sun instead.  The company, called Space Perspective, is offering couples a memorable way to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù ‚Äî putting the bride and groom into orbit using a carbon-neutral balloon with giant windows to make the most of the ultimate view of planet Earth.  According to Jane Poynter, the co-founder of Space Perspective, the waiting list to get married amongst the stars is already light-years long.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already had people wanting to be the first marriage in space, so we‚Äôll see who is the first,‚Äù Poynter told The Cool Down.  ‚ÄúUnlike all other spacecraft whereby the crewed compartment separates from one flight system mid-flight and transfers to another flight system, Spaceship Neptune‚Äôs capsule remains secured to the SpaceBalloon the entire flight from liftoff to splashdown, creating a seamlessly safe and gentle flight,‚Äù she explained.  The website said the technology the spacecraft uses has already been ‚Äúproven,‚Äù as it has been used for decades by NASA teams and other government agencies to ‚Äúlift research telescopes and other heavy, sensitive instruments.‚Äù  Space Perspective was founded by two former crew members of Biosphere 2, an Earth system science research facility located in Arizona, which was originally constructed to explore the potential of closed ecological systems in supporting human life during outer-space missions.  Vincent Bachet, Space Perspective lead and development engineer, added that Neptune‚Äôs windows are going to be ‚Äúthe biggest windows flown into space.‚Äù  Using hyper-resistant materials and a special anti-UV coating, Space Perspective co-founder and co-CEO Taber MacCallum called them ‚Äúthe quintessential part of the experience.‚Äù  Couples who are interesting in the unique wedding experience can join the waitlist on Space Perspective‚Äôs website for late 2024.

"wedding","2008-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:30:00","If you asked Carolina Favero Braga if she would end up with Freud Milice as she began her emergency room rotation in 2015, her answer would likely be a resounding no. The twosome worked alongside each other for two weeks at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn when she was a medical school student and he was a resident. As Carolina puts it, their courtship wasn‚Äôt exactly love at first sight. ‚ÄúI was skeptical of his big personality and braggadocios behavior,‚Äù Carolina admits. ‚ÄúOn our first few days working together, he told me he loved house parties, red wine, and older women. Eye roll.‚Äù  But, in a plot twist of romantic comedy proportions, Freud managed to get Carolina‚Äôs number and would text her after every shift‚Äîand even when she traveled to Florida. ‚ÄúOn the day I was returning to New York, he knew I was anxious about flying, and sent me Angus and Julia Stone‚Äôs ‚ÄòBig Jet Plane‚Äô single to keep me calm throughout the flight. When I landed at JFK, he surprised me and was waiting at baggage claim. Five days later, we went on our first official date. As they say, the rest is history.‚Äù  Fast-forward to June 5, 2020, when the couple was taking a socially distanced trip to the Catskills. As physicians, both Carolina and Freud were on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic and took a well-deserved vacation once restrictions began to loosen. ‚ÄúWhen we arrived, the hotel staff recommended a walk in the garden prior to dinner,‚Äù she shares. ‚ÄúWe got ready and while walking the garden, Freud got down on one knee. I am sure he had more to say but all I remember is, ‚ÄòWill you marry me?‚Äô‚Äù The answer? A resounding yes.  When it came to planning their September 3, 2022, wedding, the couple wanted their special day to highlight the bride‚Äôs Brazilian background and the groom‚Äôs Haitian roots. They enlisted wedding planner Nathalie Cadet-James of Luxe Fete, who had the perfect spot in mind: Itapororoca Villa in Trancoso, Brazil. ‚ÄúThere is the essence of West Africa in this rustic Brazilian beach town,‚Äù the bride explains. ‚ÄúWith its scenic backdrops and rich culture, we knew this was the perfect place to share our love story with family and friends.‚Äù  With 80 of their closest friends and family members in attendance, their destination was a beautiful representation of Carolina and Freud in every way imaginable. ‚ÄúAs an interracial couple, it was important for us to highlight our different backgrounds,‚Äù the bride shares. ‚ÄúNathalie is Haitian-American, and she really understood who we were as individuals, but also as a couple. Her excitement to celebrate our love story was noticeable from before we even officially hired her.‚Äù Read on for an intimate look at Carolina and Freud‚Äôs wedding festivities, as photographed by Heather Waraksa.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina and Freud didn‚Äôt have to look too far for wedding inspiration. Elements of Trancoso‚Äôs seaside beauty were woven throughout the weekend. From watercolor illustrations to magenta accents that pay tribute to the local bougainvillea flowers, the invitation suite from LetterHeads Miami gave guests the perfect glimpse of what was to come.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The couple kicked off the festivities with a beach party the night before the wedding. Carolina stunned in a white dress from Farm Rio, while Freud looked effortlessly elegant in a white button-down from Peter Millar and matching shorts.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  ‚ÄúOur wedding [weekend] didn‚Äôt have a traditional timeline,‚Äù the bride shares. ‚ÄúWe had our maid of honor and best man make their speeches during the welcome party so they could enjoy themselves. We know the effort it took for our guests to celebrate with us and we wanted them to enjoy themselves to the fullest.‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Come the wedding day, the bride wore a strapless gown from Valentini Spose, which beautifully fulfilled her ‚Äúclean and timeless vision.‚Äù She shares, ‚ÄúI truly believed that this was my day and wanted to wear something that made me feel spectacular. I was also three months postpartum when I started shopping for a wedding dress, so it was important for me to feel confident in it."" Carolina adds, ""I don‚Äôt know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  When it came to accessorizing her gown, Carolina knew she wanted to support women-owned businesses. She opted for a veil by Jennifer Leigh Couture Veils, Julia Vaughn jewelry, and a special pair of shoes from Brother Vellies. ‚ÄúDuring the beginning of the pandemic, I followed [Brother Vellies founder] Aurora James on Instagram,‚Äù Carolina explains. ‚ÄúIt had to be fate that [she] designed a bridal shoe line for HBO‚Äôs Insecure. I texted Nathalie and the team and said, ‚ÄòI know I don‚Äôt have a dress yet, but I know this is the shoe.‚Äô So, I actually bought my bridal shoes before I had a dress!‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Meanwhile, the groom suited up in a custom navy tuxedo from Suitsupply. Rounding out the look was a tie from Tom Ford, Herm√®s shoes, and his everyday accessories. ‚ÄúFreud wore his watch and a bracelet which was engraved with his daughter‚Äôs name,‚Äù Carolina adds.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Prior to the ceremony, the couple had an ‚Äúintimate and emotional‚Äù first look. ‚ÄúWe wanted to have a moment between us before sharing ‚Äòus‚Äô with everyone else,‚Äù the groom explains.

Photo by Heather Waraksa  ‚ÄúOur ceremony was on the beach underneath coconut trees with a wooden altar decorated with bougainvillea,‚Äù the bride shares. ‚ÄúIt was very simple, but elegant at the same time.‚Äù The view of the ocean was a welcomed bonus.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina glided down the aisle to Felix Mendelssohn‚Äôs ‚ÄúMarcha Nupcial,‚Äù with her father and a bouquet of local flowers in tow.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Freud spent months writing his vows during his night shifts, promising to ‚Äúbe present, to be here next week, next month, next year, and the year after that.‚Äù Meanwhile, Carolina performed a song she often sings to their daughter at night. Her favorite lyrics: ‚ÄúI love you in the morning, and in the afternoon. I love you in the evening, and underneath the moon.‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The newlyweds slipped on their wedding bands from Boccardo Jewelers, shared a kiss, and recessed down the aisle to Bob Marley‚Äôs ‚ÄúIs This Love.‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Make time to enjoy special moments with each other.

There was one long table in the reception area with no assigned seating, which was to be decorated with magenta flowers among greenery.‚Äù The bride‚Äôs favorite area was the dessert room‚Äîa bougainvillea-adorned space that displayed ‚Äúhundreds of sweets‚Äù on floating trays.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  If guests were craving fresh air, they could hang out in one of the venue‚Äôs chill outdoor seating areas.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  True to their love story, Carolina and Freud shared a sweet first dance to Angus and Julia Stone‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Jet Plane.‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  While the newlyweds opted for a buffet style of local Bahian-inspired food‚Äîcourtesy of O Cacau‚Äîthey tapped Confet Doceria to whip up a four-tiered cake. ‚ÄúWe had two different flavors. One layer was white cake with brigadeiro filling, [which is a traditional Brazilian dessert],‚Äù the bride explains. ‚ÄúThe other layers were white cake with dulce de leche filling.‚Äù  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Since Carolina and Freud love music‚Äîthey have a shared fondness of hip-hop‚Äîthey wanted to find a DJ who understood their taste. ‚ÄúWe worked closely with our DJ, Nath Carreiro, to play music that played significant parts in our lives both as individuals and as a couple,‚Äù the groom notes. ""We shared with her Spotify playlists for both the welcome party and the wedding. DJ Nath was a smashing success!"" In fact, the newlyweds even infiltrated the DJ booth during the evening with their daughter, Celine.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  ‚ÄúWe were on the dance floor for most of the wedding,‚Äù Freud explains. But, according to the couple, guests left the event with more than some new dance moves. ‚ÄúBecause many of our friends had never been to Brazil before, we focused a high level of detail on the experience that our guests would have,‚Äù Carolina shares. ‚ÄúFreud created a WhatsApp group with all the guests as a way for everyone to connect a few weeks prior to the wedding. Our guests were able to get to know each other and it made it even more special on the wedding day.

Gary Moretti and Deanna Mifsud booked their dream wedding in Lippincott Manor and had reserved a block of 30 rooms for guests to stay at The Crossroads Hotel nearby in Newburgh, New York. They reportedly expected 160 guests from across the country to attend their June 24 wedding.  The couple says their plans were turned upside down when they learned their hotel block had been cancelled to make room for migrants that were being sent upstate by New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The Crossroads Hotel was tapped to accept migrants who were being bused from New York City to hotels in Westchester and the Hudson Valley.  ""We woke up the other morning and got a phone call from my sister...to check out the news,"" Moretti told "" Jesse Watters Primetime "" on Tuesday. ""No phone call, no text message, no email from them about any cancellations. I call them up and ...

In a new interview in Brides magazine, the Dancing with the Stars alum, who turns 38 on Wednesday, and his fianc√©e, 28, revealed that the price of planning a wedding has come as a bit of a shock.  ""It's a very eye-opening experience, and when you start to add everything up, it's pretty wild,"" Hough said.  As the pieces for their ceremony and reception come together, the couple revealed that they have already chosen a venue, and that fireworks and a first dance ‚Äî naturally ‚Äî are in the cards.  For the choreographer and actor, and his dancer bride-to-be, the wedding isn't so much about ""perfection"" as it is about a ""vibe,"" which is important when it comes to the guest list.  ""A rule that we've set is that we don't want to catch up with people on the day of the wedding,"" Erbert said. ""We're inviting people that maybe we haven't seen in a while, but every time we get together with them, it's like we pick up right where we left off, or they're people that have been consistently in our lives throughout the years.

He added, ""We want the entire day to be a blast.""  And as for that first dance, Erbert revealed that it will be a special moment, even if Hough wasn't so interested in the wedding tradition at first.

The suit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Common Pleas by Aric Hutchinson and two other people hurt in the crash, names more than a half dozen defendants including Jamie Lee Komoroski, who police arrested in connection to the April 28th death of Samantha Miller 34.  Miller, from Charlotte, North Carolina, was killed in the Folly Beach crash in Charleston County.  Three other of Miller's family members, including Hutchinson, suffered major injuries in the two-vehicle late evening crash.  The lawsuit also names five local businesses as defendants and claims Komoroski, 25, had been ""bar hopping"" the day of the wreck, which according to an arrest affidavit, involved a rented Toyota Camry slamming into the golf cart.  In addition to wrongful death, the 28-page suit also accuses the defendants of gross negligence, reckless hiring, supervision and training as well as ""negligent infliction of emotional distress.""  'Noticeably and visibly intoxicated'  A responding Folly Beach police officer, who found the victims on the ground at the scene, said the driver of the Camry smelled strongly of alcohol and admitted to drinking ""one beer and a drink with tequila about an hour ago.""  ‚ÄúDespite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments,‚Äù the lawsuit reads, ‚ÄúJaime Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.‚Äù  Former Raider enters plea in DUI caseEx-Raider Henry Ruggs pleads guilty to driving drunk at 156 mph, causing fatal crash  ""This case is about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly,"" the family's Charleston-based attorney Danny Dalton said.  The plaintiffs ask for a jury trial and seek punitive damages among other costs in connection to the case.  Just married  Earlier this month, Folly Beach Public Safety Department Chief Andrew Gilreath told USA TODAY Hutchinson and Miller were married just hours before the 10:15 p.m. wreck.  Police said data retrieved from Komoroski‚Äôs rental car show she was driving 65 mph and briefly hit the brakes before she slammed into the golf cart.  Komoroski, who is from Charleston, refused a sobriety and a breath test, according to her arrest affidavit. She was arrested and medical personnel drew a blood sample from her.  Prince Harry in harrowing ""car chase""Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan say they were in 'near catastrophic' car chase with paparazzi  According to additional court papers, when her blood was drawn her Blood Alcohol Content was 0.261, more than three times the legal limit to drive.

"wedding","2019-07-01","14:00:00","{""WestHartford"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:00:00","Getting engaged, planning a wedding, and preparing for life with your favorite person is one of the most exciting and joyful times of your life, but it can also be rife with familial conflicts, disagreements over the budget, and the need for a lot of compromises. Still, every challenge you face while planning your wedding is an opportunity to improve your relationship, strengthen your bond, and deepen your communication skills as a couple.  ‚ÄúDefining your shared values, navigating conflict, getting on the same page in terms of finances, deciding how we spend time in relationships outside of our primary relationships‚Äîany number of topics that come up during wedding planning need to get negotiated on an ongoing basis,‚Äù says Jennifer Uhrlass, licensed marriage and family therapist at Modern MFT in New York City. ‚ÄúIt has to be an ongoing, open dialogue, which is really training for the ongoing negotiations that are going that are going to take place along the course of the relationship.‚Äù  Meet the Expert Jennifer Uhrlass is a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) at Modern MFT in New York City.  Ahead, Uhrlass speaks to us about how this crucial window of time‚Äîthe engagement period‚Äîcan be an opportunity for couples to strengthen their relationship and build new skills as partners.  Communicate and Compromise  Every aspect of your wedding is about the two of you as a couple, which means you‚Äôll both need to compromise to create a day that speaks to two different personalities. Sometimes it‚Äôs easy: Maybe one partner doesn‚Äôt care about the signature cocktails or the other partner doesn‚Äôt have a preference for the reception exit. But when only one partner is set on a destination wedding, or wants a religious ceremony, or won‚Äôt trim the guest list, the middle ground can be much harder to find.  The key, says Uhrlass, is making sure you take the time to fully listen to and process your partner‚Äôs wishes‚Äîand express your own‚Äîso that you can come to an agreement you are both on board with. ‚ÄúDo you truly, truly hear and understand the other person‚Äôs perspective, or are you just glossing over stuff and moving forward without understanding?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere are times when you can miss each other‚Äôs message‚Äîthe message sent is not always the message received. Recognize the importance of slowing down the interaction, making sure you heard and understood what your partner said, and making sure that you can come to a mutual understanding.‚Äù  Get Into an Argument‚Äîor Several  Arguments about the details of your wedding‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs your partner‚Äôs desire to torpedo the guest list by adding three tables of fraternity brothers or your own insistence on a specific type of music‚Äîare precursors to future conflicts in your life together. How you approach and solve these conflicts helps you lay the foundation for healthy and productive disagreements in the future. ‚ÄúLearning how to navigate conflict effectively with your partner is essential,‚Äù says Uhrlass. ‚ÄúYou have to be able to do that well with each other because the problems are going to be perpetual. There's always going to be a need to navigate and negotiate ongoing issues throughout the course of the relationship.‚Äù Today it‚Äôs the guest list and cake flavors; tomorrow it may be where to send your kids to school or how to spend your year-end bonus. ‚ÄúOften, partners tend to get caught up in the content of a disagreement, when it can be much more productive to focus on their process of engagement when it comes to a particular conflict,‚Äù says Uhrlass. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs important is to learn how to navigate that conflict effectively; not so much trying to avoid conflict altogether, but to recognize that conflict is a healthy part of a relationship.‚Äù  Photo by Getty Images; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Family Boundaries  Weddings can bring out the best in your family, but there's no denying that they can also bring out the worst. Explaining to your parents that you won‚Äôt be tying the knot at your childhood church, telling your mother-in-law her entire bridge club didn‚Äôt make the guest list, breaking the news to your siblings that their toddlers won‚Äôt be invited to the reception: These family conflicts (and many others) have the potential to put you and your partner on opposite teams. As you prepare for your wedding, it's important to remember that you‚Äôre also developing a new team of your own. ‚ÄúOne of the natural challenges around the topic of getting married is that there‚Äôs a shift: You were part of one family unit and now you‚Äôre cultivating a new family unit in your relationship with your partner,‚Äù says Uhrlass. ‚ÄúMoving through this identity shift can bring up a lot of conflicts and a lot of emotion.‚Äù  Use this time to set collective boundaries as a couple, understand each other‚Äôs family history, and prioritize your partnership. ‚ÄúIt is possible to work through this through dialogue and understanding each person‚Äôs perspective,‚Äù says Urhlass. ‚Äú‚ÄôYour mom wants this, however, for us, we‚Äôre also weighing this and this,‚Äô‚Äîyou want to make sure that you get on the same page so you can make decisions together as a unit.‚Äù  Talk About Money  How you choose to finance your wedding is a microcosm of the larger financial decisions you‚Äôll make in the future: How you put together a budget, and whether you‚Äôll stick to it; whether you‚Äôre willing to take on credit card debt or loans, or accept money from either set of parents; whether your individual incomes and spending patterns are causing unseen conflict. Deciding whether you want to splurge on a band or spend less on a DJ is a precursor to future conversations about which house is in your budget, whether you‚Äôll put a vacation on your credit card, and how often you need to upgrade your television. ‚ÄúNavigating issues related to finances is a common point of contention,‚Äù says Urhlass. ‚ÄúIt could bring up difficult emotions such as fear or feelings of inadequacy. There may also be significant power differentials; in a relationship where there's a disparity in income, it can negatively impact a couple's ability to address issues in a productive way. If partners haven't reached a place where they feel comfortable, there can be a lot to unpack there. If you're just leaving it festering in the background, and you're not really addressing it, then they will tend to get worse, or stay unaddressed, which can lead to contempt later on.‚Äù  Give Each Other Space to Destress  Every major life change brings a heightened period of stress, and you and your partner will need to know how to take care of yourselves‚Äîand each other‚Äîto get through them. ‚ÄúLearning to take care of yourself through the very difficult wedding planning process is, I think, an essential element to navigating life effectively,‚Äù says Uhrlass. ‚ÄúIf we're stressed to the max and we're not taking care of ourselves, we're not working out, we're not getting our proper sleep, we're not getting nutrition, or we're not spending time with friends, it‚Äôs going to have a major impact on how we approach topics and conflict and disagreements. It's really important to step back and stick to routines that are helpful to manage the stress effectively.‚Äù  This could mean planning your meal tasting around your partner‚Äôs weekly round of golf, making sure you have enough money set aside for weekend excursions (instead of putting all travel on hold until your honeymoon), or maintaining your Friday date night‚Äîno wedding talk allowed. ‚ÄúSet aside time to have space with each other,‚Äù says Uhrlass. ‚ÄúSpend time with each other nurturing your relationship, as opposed to talking about the to-do list for the wedding.  Define Your Shared Values  A shared vision for your big day can also help you define the elements that will become your family‚Äôs values moving forward: How closely will you follow religious traditions? How often will you see your parents and siblings? What constitutes a worthwhile financial investment? How do you, as a couple and as individuals, define and deepen your relationships with your friends? ‚ÄúTwo people can have very different beliefs and philosophies about money, or [anything] across the board,‚Äù says Urhlass. ‚ÄúThat doesn't necessarily mean that they're incompatible. It just might mean that there's more to talk about, that they understand each other and make sure that they can be on the same page in terms of their long-term goals, their values, and how they want to move forward in their lives developing a sense of identity as a couple.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vaG93LXdlZGRpbmctcGxhbm5pbmctc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLTcyNTU2NTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alongside choosing the menu, flowers and decorations and sorting the table plan, body image ‚Äì how we think and feel about the way we look ‚Äì can cause worries, too.  We could not identify any previous research that had formally looked at how brides in the UK felt about their body image. To address this, and fill the gap in our knowledge, our research explored how brides felt about their body image in the run-up to their wedding. We focused in particular on any appearance concerns that they had and how these made them feel ‚Äì from the planning stage right up to the big day itself.  One hundred and thirty-four women took part in either an interview or an online survey. They were a mix of women planning their weddings and those who had been married in the past three years. Many women experienced feelings of pressure and expectation to look a certain way on their wedding day.  This article is part of Quarter Life, a series about issues affecting those of us in our twenties and thirties. From the challenges of beginning a career and taking care of our mental health, to the excitement of starting a family, adopting a pet or just making friends as an adult. The articles in this series explore the questions and bring answers as we navigate this turbulent period of life.  You may be interested in:  Love Island ditches fast fashion: how reality celebrities influence young shoppers‚Äô habits  How to make your clothes last longer ‚Äì it‚Äôs good for your bank account and the environment too  It‚Äôs not just weddings ‚Äì how celebrating small wins and unconventional milestones can bring joy  They felt that this pressure came from various sources, including family and friends. They told us that others‚Äô perceptions of how they looked affected their own feelings, both on the wedding day and afterwards. One said:  If you know other people think you look nice then you have more confidence.  Another told us:  I didn‚Äôt want to feel ashamed of my appearance. I knew there would be a lot of attention and comments on it. Didn‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôd let people down‚Ä¶there were lots of questions about my appearance and dresses mainly from other women. It felt like how I looked was part of the ‚Äòdecoration‚Äô in the same way the table settings and order of service was.  Many of the women we spoke to felt the need to adhere to these pressures through fear of judgment and the expectation that all brides should look beautiful.  Looking back  The knowledge that wedding photographs and videos would provide permanent visual evidence of how they looked added to body image pressures. One said:  I wanted to look back at the photographs and feel 100% comfortable with what I saw.  The pressure felt by the women we spoke to also stemmed from the bridal industry, which perpetuates norms and assumptions about how brides should look. One woman, for example, talked about a bad experience she had in a bridalwear shop:  I felt the ladies in the dress shop were quite judgemental, saying I needed to eat better and basically lose weight, so I felt very negative towards me.  Nearly 70% of the women we spoke to who were planning their weddings intended to lose weight in preparation for their wedding day. The pressure to lose weight had a significant effect on their feelings and emotions. One said:  I‚Äôm really worried that preparing my weight for my wedding will re-trigger my anorexia and I don‚Äôt think people talk about the unnecessary pressure for brides and grooms to lose weight.  Some of the women reported going to extreme measures to achieve their weight-loss goals, including surgery. One had a gastric band fitted in the run-up to the wedding: this is a band around the stomach that limits its expansion, leading to feeling full sooner. Another had a tummy tuck ‚Äì cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the stomach area.  Among the women we spoke to who were already married, only 27% had reached the weight they wanted to for their wedding. One said:  I was distressed when I realised I wouldn‚Äôt achieve this weight. I then felt fine approaching the day itself. However, I felt embarrassed after seeing photos of me and regretted getting married at my weight.  Our findings back up what other researchers have found in countries outside of the UK, such as in Australia and the US. This research has drawn attention to the powerful pressures related to wedding appearance and the expectation of how women should look when getting married.  If you are getting married, then it is completely natural for you to want to look your best, but prioritise your own wellbeing, too.  If one of your friends or family members is getting married, or if you work in the wedding industry, be conscious of what you are saying to the brides in your life. Make sure you are not inadvertently adding any pressures or expectations to them by commenting on their appearance during what can already be a stressful time. Focus on the joy and connection that is the real heart of a wedding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vaXQtZmVsdC1saWtlLWhvdy1pLWxvb2tlZC13YXMtcGFydC1vZi10aGUtZGVjb3JhdGlvbi1ob3ctZ2V0dGluZy13ZWQtYWZmZWN0cy13b21lbnMtYm9keS1pbWFnZS0yMDI4ODLSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2FtcC9pdC1mZWx0LWxpa2UtaG93LWktbG9va2VkLXdhcy1wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1kZWNvcmF0aW9uLWhvdy1nZXR0aW5nLXdlZC1hZmZlY3RzLXdvbWVucy1ib2R5LWltYWdlLTIwMjg4Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

She kept working while completing Kirkwood Community College‚Äôs horticulture program.  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her Parrott Floral Co. home design studio last Wednesday in southwest Cedar Rapids. She opened her business last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Advertisement  Gaining some 15 years experience, Parrott and her husband, Joey, decided last year it was time to strike out on her own.  ‚ÄúI had been doing it for other businesses and just decided I wanted to be doing it for myself,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI knew what it all entailed, and what I needed.‚Äù  A small toolshed in her backyard became her studio, freshened with new paint and outfitted with work tables and a florist‚Äôs refrigerator to keep blooms fresh.  ‚ÄúThankfully, we had this workshop,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was just storage. We started converting, and it went really quickly after I decided I wanted to for-sure do it.‚Äù  Wedding specialty  Parrott‚Äôs goal is to specialize on weddings, but she‚Äôs taken other business during her start-up.  ‚ÄúFrom the beginning, I knew I was going to have to do some everyday retail,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFriends and family will say, ‚ÄòHey, can you do a birthday bouquet for me tomorrow?‚Äô And I can make it happen.‚Äù  Business News Newsletter Signup Newsletter Signup Delivered to your inbox weekdays Email Please wait...

However, there were also many B-town celebs who decided to keep their wedding an intimate affair. The trend of having a secret and hush-hush wedding also started after the Covid-19 pandemic.  But, did you know that ‚ÄòVivaah‚Äô actress Amrita Rao married the love of her life RJ Anmol at a temple in Pune on a budget as low as Rs 1,50,000?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMRITA RAO üáÆüá≥ (@amrita_rao_insta)  Recently, the couple released a YouTube video on their official channel wherein they elaborated on the cost of their wedding, the venue, and how they were able to pull off a close-knit shaadi in that budget.  In the ‚ÄòAnniversary Special‚Äô episode of ‚ÄòCouple Of Things‚Äô, they took us down memory lane to the place they got married nine years ago.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The handful of people who attended their wedding traveled from Mumbai to Iskcon Temple in Katraj, Pune where the couple secretly tied the knot. As for the stay and other functions like Sangeet, Mehendi, and Karaoke Night, the couple booked a hotel on the outskirts of Pune.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The couple further revealed that the outfits they wore were very traditional and cost not more than Rs 3000 each because they didn‚Äôt want to wear designer clothes. The ‚ÄòMain Hoon Na‚Äô actor also wore all artificial jewellery on her wedding day.  ‚ÄúWhen I told Anmol that I wanted to buy jewellery, he had told me ‚ÄòAbhi q shopping karni hai, tabhi karo na shaadi k baad.‚Äô And when the wedding happened, we were busy building our house so we had no time to shop. So, I wore artificial jewellery top to bottom. I was very angry.‚Äù  In the video, the couple then visited their wedding venue and relived those fond memories.  Amrita further revealed that she also carried her makeup kit and did her wedding makeup herself. Her family members helped her get ready for the special occasion.  They also added that one of the reasons they wanted to get married in Pune was because Amrita‚Äôs grandparents were in Pune so it was easier for them to travel to the venue. Concluding the video, Amrita shared:  ‚ÄúWe always believed that weddings should be about love, not about showing off wealth and ostentation. We wanted our wedding to be a beautiful, intimate affair with just our immediate families & close friends, and we‚Äôre glad we were able to achieve that without spending a fortune.‚Äù  To this, RJ Anmol added, ‚ÄúOur wedding was a reflection of our personalities, and we wanted to keep it humble. We would be happy if this inspires people to opt for budget-friendly weddings too.‚Äù  Clearly, you don‚Äôt have to spend crores to make memories and get married to the love of your life.

Work on the adaptation began in 2006, with Nair and the film‚Äôs screenwriter, Dhawan, collaborating with composer Vishal Bhardwaj and the lyricist Susan Birkenhead. Nair told The Times that ‚Äúshe‚Äôd been inspired by the 2004 Broadway revival of ‚ÄúFiddler on the Roof,‚Äù a show built around cultural traditions adapting to survive.  The Times further notes that ‚Äúlike the film, the musical touches upon the fallout of India‚Äôs 1947 partition, brought to life in the characters‚Äô religious, social and economic differences. Nair told the publication that the film is about ‚Äúour families, but so deeply universal ‚Äî this essential story of understanding a whole society and movement through a very personal story.‚Äù  However, the musical deviates a little from the film, in terms of messaging. For the musical, Nair had to revisit one of the film‚Äôs subplots, she told The Times, ‚Äúabout a relative‚Äôs grooming and sexual abuse of two younger family members.‚Äù A ‚Äúconcerted effort‚Äù was made to have ‚Äúthe women question the patriarchy and speak up,‚Äù Nair said. ‚ÄúOther characters who are afflicted by this don‚Äôt shove it under the rug; they make decisions in their own lives that reflect that they will not accept this behavior, which we didn‚Äôt have before.‚Äù  The change is reflective of Nair‚Äôs work which ‚Äúhas never shied away from examining cultural distinctions,‚Äù The Times notes. ‚ÄúMississippi Masala‚Äù (1991) explored the interracial romance between a Black man and Indian American woman, ‚ÄúSalaam Bombay!‚Äù (1988), revolved around children living in the slums.  ‚ÄúMonsoon Wedding‚Äù is currently playing at St. Ann‚Äôs Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, through June 25.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2FtZXJpY2Fua2FoYW5pLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3N0YWdlLWFkYXB0YXRpb24tb2YtbWlyYS1uYWlycy1tb25zb29uLXdlZGRpbmctbWFrZXMtY29uY2VydGVkLWVmZm9ydC10by1xdWVzdGlvbi1wYXRyaWFyY2h5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

A third added: ""Lucky Monty, Sarah is a beauty.""  Monty and Sarah chose much more timeless outfits on their own wedding day. On their 39th anniversary in 2022, he shared one rare throwback photo, taken in 1983, which showed the newlyweds standing outside a set of wrought iron gates, with Monty's new wife rocking an unconventional blue outfit.  Sarah ditched bridal white for a dusty cornflower jacket with large buttons down the front, which she paired with a chunky necklace and matching earrings.  Meanwhile, Monty didn't appear to have aged at all ‚Äì he sported the same thick curly hair and big grin and wore a cream suit and black spotty tie.  He accompanied the photo with a heartfelt message to his childhood sweetheart Sarah, whom he met at Cambridge University. ""We got married 39 years ago today - the picture is a little faded, a little wrinkly, like us but the love is as evergreen and strong now as it was all those years ago,"" Monty sweetly wrote.  Monty and Sarah share three children, Tom, Adam and Freya, and they are proud grandparents to George and Daisy Rose. However, Sarah candidly opened up about her ill health following childbirth and the impact it had on their marriage in their book, The Jewel Garden.  ""I was ill for months after our daughter was born despite having had a supposedly film-star birth at an enormously expensive private London hospital,"" Sarah wrote. ""I had a slipped disc, a result of the bodged delivery, and was so anaemic that I needed a blood transfusion.  ""My injuries were not acknowledged and as we tried to leave the hospital I had to walk down three flights of stairs because the lift had broken. I was unable to walk or stand properly for over a year,"" she shared.  Being bedridden put a strain on their relationship, with Sarah candidly writing: ""When it came down to it, Montagu was a loony and I was ill all the time.""

She donned a pink, peachy shade that was minimal, yet memorable ‚Äì perfectly in line with her understated elegance and effortless personal style.  On her wedding day, Richie told Vogue that she wanted her look to feel timeless. Richie enlisted makeup artist Pati Dubroff, who leaned into subtle enhancements to the star‚Äôs natural beauty. Paired with a glossy gold lid and sunkissed blush, Dubroff accentuated her lips with a sheerness that wasn‚Äôt too saturated. ‚ÄúWe wanted the lips to look fresh and soft, and not have a weighty lipstick feeling. Kissable lips!‚Äù she explains. In the end, this was achieved with a Chanel tinted lip balm accompanied by a natural contour shade lip pencil.  Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Hydrating Beautifying Tinted Lip Balm Buildable Colour ¬£34 at CHANEL  Part of the intrigue of Rouge Coco Baume is how it veils the lips in a practical, buildable colour. As you layer your chosen shade, the finish transforms from a sheer, barely there color to a more opaque and luminous pigment. Richie‚Äôs lip was done with shade 928 Pink Delight, one of nine shades that range from rich reds to iridescent pearls. My personal favorite? 914 Natural Charm, which enhances my pout‚Äôs natural colour.  ‚ÄúThe Rouge Coco Baume range is hydrating and my constant go to!‚Äù Dubroff says, admitting that the formula is perfect for not only summer but in cooler temperatures when lips are more easily chapped. Why? The balm is enriched with a fruit and olive leaf-derived oil that boasts antioxidant and rejuvenation benefits ‚Äì meaning lips are soft, hydrated, and smoother upon application.

"wedding","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:02","The coronation of King Charles III was brimming with historical moments, but the Princess of Wales wearing a custom bejewelled headpiece instead of a tiara was not one I saw coming. There were whispers leading up to the day that Kate would forgo crown jewels at the request of the King because he wanted a more modest ceremony (not sure if we would call this event less opulent, but okay). And veering far from tradition, Kate chose a bespoke leafy-floral headpiece crafted from sequins, metallic beading and sparkling silver threadwork by Jess Collett X Alexander McQueen. It was a royal fashion moment for the books (as was the matching smaller version of the headpiece worn by Princess Charlotte), and one that has tipped off a trend of exquisite and elaborate bejewelled wedding headpieces as coveted accessory.  ‚ÄúI thought Catherine‚Äôs headpiece conveyed a youthful and whimsical vibe,‚Äù says Toronto-based accessory designer Blair Nadeau, founder and owner of Blair Nadeau Bridal Adornments, who is renowned for her exquisite jewellery, veils, hair accessories and crowns. ‚ÄúI literally squealed when I saw it. This accessory didn‚Äôt feel old and stuffy, it felt fresh. I loved the tiered leaf and floral motif and the doubled-banded style. The look is perfect for a wedding because it‚Äôs elegant and impactful and very modern feeling.‚Äù  Nadeau says the organic shape of Kate‚Äôs instantly iconic headpiece is what makes it easy and effortless for brides to wear. ‚ÄúWe are still in a bit of a minimalist era but starting to see the emergence of softer silhouettes and more texture with three-dimensional details like floral embellishments and lace patterns,‚Äù she shares. ‚ÄúThe silver tone provided an airy lightness that is very much happening now with accessories after years of bold gold designs.‚Äù  If you‚Äôre feeling the luxe headpiece vibe for your wedding day, Nadeau has a few thoughts on how to wear them. Pair a design like Kate‚Äôs with a light and airy dress with a fluid silhouette made from tulle, chiffon or lace. She also recommends keeping hair easy and not overly styled. ‚ÄúI actually love the juxtaposition of soft waves with a statement headpiece,‚Äù says Nadeau. ‚ÄúIf you do wear it up, keep it soft and a little imperfect, not too sleek.‚Äù  As for adding other wedding accessories, keep it simple and classic. Kate opted for a pair of diamond and South Sea pearl drop earrings that belonged to Princess Diana, which Nadeau says worked because they complemented the motif of her headpiece. ‚ÄúI actually love a veil combined with a statement headpiece, but the trick is to keep it simple and minimal,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAlways remember your wedding accessories are there to complement you and your dress.‚Äù  Bejewelled wedding headpieces to shop now  This bold trend is here to stay for several wedding seasons  The shape and finish of the Victoria headpiece is very much in step with the Princess of Wales‚Äôs style on Coronation day. It‚Äôs the perfect match for big, bold and volumized hair!  The Arielle headband by Jennifer Behr was first launched in 2010 and continues to be a runaway bestseller. It features hundreds of Swarovski-crystal-adorned leaves fastened to a silver ribbon-wrapped skinny headband.  The Millaray crown features a dramatic criss-cross design that creates a delicate and bold effect. Crafted from crystal beads, enamel and brass flowers, sterling-silver-plated wire and Mokuba silk ribbon, this piece is truly breathtaking.  The Cecilia headband is bedazzling hand-crafted custom piece that can take up to 16 weeks to receive from order date, so plan accordingly. This beauty is hanndmade from rhodium plating and is detailed with fresh water pearls and Swarovski crystals.  The Henri headband mixes pearls and crystals to create a maximum impact wedding accessory. This one would look amazing as a re-wear for any weddings or formal events on your upcoming calendar.  This is an amazing piece of hair jewellery that is very deco-inspired! It wraps around your head and is anchored by two dazzling leaf motifs on either side‚Äîso dramatic and so different!  We love the vintage vibe bow design of this glittering headband by designer Keren Wolf. This halo-style headpiece is easy to wear and pairs beautifully with easy, breezy wedding hair.

"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Atlanta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:43:18","There are several widely accepted rules for wedding speeches: Don‚Äôt talk about exes. Don‚Äôt dredge up drunken antics. And whatever you do, don‚Äôt wing it.  But a new etiquette question has recently emerged: Can you use AI to write them?  Couples and their loved ones are putting ChatGPT to the emotional Turing test, as they seek to give vows and toasts that are personal and eloquent but don‚Äôt rely on a writerly touch. What they‚Äôre finding is that AI can‚Äôt beat a human on the feelings front‚Äîphew!‚Äîbut it can perhaps help prompt memories or create structure.  Ten days before her wedding, Kelly Tenn, 35, found herself on the planning website Joy, answering prompts from its free AI speechwriting tool, which relies on OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT technology.  ‚ÄúFor me, there‚Äôs obviously this big craze around AI tools over the past few months, and I was a bit skeptical to try to use a tool like this,"" said Ms. Tenn, a brand-marketing executive for a cloud-technology company in San Francisco. She doesn‚Äôt find writing hard‚Äî‚ÄúI work in content,"" she said‚Äîbut for vows ‚Äúit takes a little bit more creativity in how you articulate something that is summarizing your relationship over many years and years to come.""  Ms. Tenn used the product to create multiple versions of AI-generated vows, including prose ‚Äúspoken like a friend"" and ‚ÄúShakespearean-style verbiage"" (‚ÄúSo often have I pondered our love and asked, wherefrom hath thy love descended so unexpectedly?""). Ultimately she scrapped the drafts, which she found basic and nondescript, but she said using the tool helped her break out of writer‚Äôs block.  The tool also eased her woes about getting up in front of a crowd on her wedding day. ‚ÄúPublic speaking is not something I prefer to do,"" Ms. Tenn said. ‚ÄúThis is one of many ways to help lower the barrier and alleviate nerves.""  Write Your Own Vows Using AI  Let‚Äôs write vows to an imaginary spouse. Once you answer these questions, the AI tool ChatGPT will generate vows based on your responses.  Ahead of their April wedding, Jeff and Allison Hood of Atlanta used Provenance‚Äôs toast and vow builder, which launched in early 2023. It prompts each partner to share stories, memories and promises for their future spouse. Through the service, which costs $19.99, each partner can also view the relative length and tone of their significant others‚Äô vows without seeing the contents.  ‚ÄúThere was really nothing that didn‚Äôt sound like my authentic voice,"" said Mr. Hood, 34, a custom clothier. Since he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a novelist,"" he was grateful that the tool presented his thoughts in a way that flowed well.  Ms. Hood, 32 and head of growth for a digital-marketing agency, kept a running list in her phone of all the things she loves about her partner since they started dating four years ago. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just like ‚ÄòI stubbed my toe and he brought me a Band-Aid and I felt so special,‚Äô"" she said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt something I could actually say on my wedding day.""  Left to her own devices, Ms. Hood said her vows would have sounded as though they had been written by a second-grader: ‚ÄúWill you marry me? Check ‚Äòyes‚Äô or ‚Äòno.‚Äô"" Reading what Provenance came up with, she thought, ‚Äú‚ÄòWow, I would have never worded it this way and it sounds so thoughtful‚Äîand the way that I actually feel.‚Äô""  Less than two weeks before giving a rehearsal-dinner toast for a best friend‚Äôs wedding, Randi Kramer, 29, thought: How do I capture nearly a decade of friendship in just a few minutes? Another friend suggested she try ToastWiz, a paid service for crafting speeches that uses AI.  ‚ÄúMore than anything, it was a tool that got me past writer‚Äôs block,"" said Ms. Kramer, an associate editor at a publishing house in New York City. Thanks to prompts the form gave her‚Äîsuch as asking for adjectives to describe the couple and a favorite anecdote about the bride‚ÄîMs. Kramer was finally able ‚Äúto get the juices flowing.""  She paid $30 for three speech drafts. ‚ÄúI was able to Frankenstein it together,"" she said, estimating that a third of what the chatbot produced made it into her final speech.  ‚ÄúI definitely didn‚Äôt tell anyone,"" she said, of using the service.  Julia Rosenson, 25, a software engineer in New York City, used Joy‚Äôs service to help write her maid of honor speech for her sister‚Äôs coming September wedding. While she‚Äôs found it to be ‚Äúa fun little tool"" to play with, Ms. Rosenson said it should only be used for inspiration.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty hit or miss‚Äîmostly miss‚Äîjust because they don‚Äôt know my sister at all,"" she said, ‚Äúbut they put together a whole story,"" adding that it was quite funny to read. ‚ÄúIt generates anecdotes as if I were going to tell a story about my sister and her fianc√© on a camping trip they never took, or some pivotal imaginary relationship moment,"" Ms. Rosenson said.  Joy‚Äôs CEO Vishal Joshi said the tool‚Äôs invented anecdotes should be seen as placeholders for personal material. ‚ÄúIt will make up interesting stories where it could be like, ‚ÄòOK, a story quote over here would be nice,‚Äô"" he said.  Kyle and Sarah Kuo, both 26, of Tempe, Ariz., used Provenance to prepare for their April 2023 wedding. Ms. Kuo, a registered nurse at an outpatient family practice, especially liked the fact that you could cross-check your partner‚Äôs vows to make sure you were on the same page, tone-wise.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to put too many jokes in there if your partner is being serious and sentimental,"" she said.  For his part, Mr. Kuo, a director of operations at a production company, was just glad to have his time back.  ‚ÄúI would have had to Google ‚Äòhow to write your vows‚Äô and read through, you know, nine articles,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFscy93b3VsZC15b3UtdXNlLWFpLXRvLXdyaXRlLXlvdXItd2VkZGluZy12b3dzLXRoZXktZGlkLTExNjg0MjU0MzY0MjY2Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vc3BlY2lhbHMvd291bGQteW91LXVzZS1haS10by13cml0ZS15b3VyLXdlZGRpbmctdm93cy10aGV5LWRpZC9hbXAtMTE2ODQyNTQzNjQyNjYuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2022-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:21:00","Ukrainian troops train to use commercial drones to spot and target enemy forces in Kharkiv Oblast in August. Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  In the days after Russia's invasion last year, Ukrainian forces need help targeting Russian troops.  One Ukrainian artillery unit relied on help from Ukrainian civilians to guide their strikes.  Using repurposed drones, cameras and phones, and Google Maps, that unit put rounds on its targets.  Hobby drones and Google Maps were designed to enhance human life, not to end it, but when Russian tank columns seemed to be closing in on Kyiv in the days after Russia's attack on February 24, 2022, desperate Ukrainian defenders found they had two unlikely assets.  Col. Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine's 43rd Artillery Brigade, and Col. Serhiy Ogerenko, the brigade's chief of staff, told Ukrainian media that they were able to use civilian drones and Google Maps, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian civilians, to locate and target Russian forces in the early days of the war.  At the time, Ukrainian gunners faced the problem of hitting Russian vehicles ‚Äî moving targets ‚Äî without trained forward observers to estimate where the vehicle would be when the shell landed.  ""That's why we needed 'eyes,'"" Ogerenko said. ""We called civilians and asked, 'Do you see this section of the road? If a shell hits in a minute and a half, can you tell us at least roughly where it exploded?' Then the person would describe the place of the explosion, and we would open a Google map and see, yes, there is such a place behind the vegetable gardens.""  A woman uses her smartphone in a house damaged by shelling in southeastern Kyiv in March 2022. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images  Civilians also offered to use their hobby drones as scouts and artillery spotters. DJI Mavic quadcopters ‚Äî nicknamed ""wedding drones"" because that is what they were used to record before the war ‚Äî proved invaluable to the 43rd Artillery Brigade.  ""They provided the picture,"" Shevchuk said, according to a translation of the interview. ""4G, WhatsApp, a video call ‚Äî the cameraman picked up, saw something, took off his phone, and said, 'look what I have.' I looked at it and said, 'hold it. We're going to shoot now.' It was convenient.""  Story continues  Drones ‚Äî both military-designed and civilian models ‚Äî are among the most vital assets for troops on both sides of the war. Ukrainian and Russian drones prowl the skies constantly, looking for enemy positions and movements, as well as for artillery batteries, supply depots, and command posts.  Shevchuk recounted how ""one guy from a gas station even gave us access to his camera."" Rather than explain the situation to Ukrainian gunners, the owner told them, ""'here's the password. See for yourself,'"" Shevchuk recalled. ""That's how we saw our first live target ‚Äî a column of Chechens near Novyi Bykiv [37 miles from Kyiv] heading towards Kyiv. So we 'met' them three kilometers [1.9 miles] further.""  A drone operator corrects Ukrainian 82mm mortar fire toward Russian positions in the Donetsk region in April. SERGEY SHESTAK/AFP via Getty Images  Sometimes Ukrainian forces would get indications that Russian troops were in a village, but not their precise location. ""We open a Google map, see a store, see its phone number, and dial it,"" said Shevchuk, who described a typical conversation:  ""Good evening, we are from Ukraine! Do you have any Katsaps [Ukrainian slur for Russians] in the village?"" ""Yes."" ""Where?"" ""Behind Grandma Hanna's house."" ""What house does Grandma Hanna have?"" ""Well, everyone knows her!""  ""So you talk to people a little bit and realize where everything is,"" Shevchuk added.  This isn't the only example of how Ukrainian civil society is using consumer technology to enhance Ukraine's military capabilities. To cope with waves of Russian long-range drones penetrating deep into Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainian military has formed mobile air-defense teams equipped with short-range anti-aircraft weapons.  Ordinary citizens can use cellphone apps to report drone sightings to a central database, which can then alert mobile air-defense units.  Ukrainian troops fire an 2S7 Pion howitzer at Russian positions near Bakhmut in March. Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Ukrainians using video cameras and cellphones to call in artillery fire on Russians forces as they pass by is a bizarre, almost comical, illustration of how a modern war can play out in an urban environment. But it also shows how much danger those civilians faced from invaders intent on defeating Ukraine's military and then repressing the Ukrainian public.  Russian troops and Wagner Group mercenaries have been accused of numerous atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, and Moscow has clamped down on Ukrainians living in areas it still controls in an effort to prevent attacks by partisans or special-operations forces. Anyone suspected of providing intelligence to Ukraine's devastatingly effective artillery could expect little mercy.  ""We lost contact with many people, and some said: 'That's it, I'm turning off my phone, deleting all my contacts. There are Russians in the next house,'"" Shevchuk said of civilians his forces were in contact with. ""Some people immediately said: 'I'm scared, don't ask me any questions.' But people called us from everywhere.""  Michael Peck is a defense writer whose work has appeared in Forbes, Defense News, Foreign Policy magazine, and other publications.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:00:00","AN invitation to a wedding is a bit of a two-edged sword.  There‚Äôs the compliment of being asked to celebrate the nuptials of friends, making you feel a tiny bit important, or at least, definitely not a c-lister.  The c-listers are relegated to the ‚Äòinsult‚Äô otherwise known as the ‚Äòafters‚Äô where sandwiches are served and you might be offloaded with a slice of wedding cake.  The afters really are something of an after-thought for people that don‚Äôt make the grade but can‚Äôt be completely forgotten about either.  Are they expected to give a gift to the couple? It‚Äôs a bit of a minefield.  Thankfully, most of my friends are not the marrying kind so I haven‚Äôt been encumbered with the diplomatic shenanigans involved in trying to decide on a gift versus cash. I believe cash is king. (There‚Äôs no point in buying a toaster or some other kitchen implement for a couple that will most likely have been living together for years and have everything they need.)  But what is really tricky is the invitation to a destination wedding. It‚Äôs all very well if you decide to get married on a beach in Bali in flip flops and a floaty white dress. But think of the guests.  A couple may find it hard to believe, but travelling for a wedding is often seen as hassle and as expensive.  It requires taking some of your annual leave from work, which you might really resent, having hoped to save your days off to go on a decent holiday of your own choice.  You really may not want to have to rock up somewhere in Italy for a wedding event that, in the old days, used to just take place over the course of a day.  It‚Äôs downright cheeky to assume that your friends and family will welcome a wedding abroad. While close family members have no choice but to follow the couple to a hired villa in France or wherever, friends will be counting the cost.  You‚Äôre talking a few grand (at least ‚Ç¨2,000) which is a big ask for a guest. There‚Äôs all the logistics of getting from the airport to the wedding venue which might be hours away, somewhere deep in the Italian countryside.  Scenic and romantic? Certainly, but far from practical.  Whatever happened to the Saturday wedding in a hotel serving beef or salmon? Now, folk want to emulate celebrities with their fancy notions involving hiring a wedding planner and dragging their mates abroad because ‚Äòit‚Äôs all about the experience‚Äô.  Yes, making memories can be expensive.  But now you have the perfect excuse to decline an invitation to a wedding in some far-flung place. It‚Äôs our old enemy ‚Äì the carbon footprint.  Can you really justify a flight when at least 2.4% of global emissions come from aviation?  Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming.  While that may not seem like a massive contributor, only a small percentage of the world flies frequently. It‚Äôs for the relatively rich and indulgent.  Put that on your wedding invitation refusal and you should be off the hook. (On the other hand, if you have plenty of time on your hands, you could indulge in ‚Äòslow travel‚Äô using boats and trains and coaches to get to the celebrations). Now that could be a great and memorable trip. But time may not be on your side.  Most of us are wage slaves unable to dedicate days and days to just travelling to a destination.  According to a BBC report, a return flight from London to San Francisco emits around 5.5 tonnes of CO2 per person, more than twice the emissions produced by a family car in a year and about half of the average carbon footprint of someone living in the UK.  Even a fairly short return flight from London to Berlin emits three times the emissions saved from a year of recycling.  A study involving 29 international students asked them to rate the importance of different flights they had taken. Just 58% of the flights were rated ‚Äòvery important‚Äô or ‚Äòimportant‚Äô.  And really, how important is a flight to the Caribbean for a wedding party?  Unless you‚Äôre close family, you‚Äôd be justified in turning down the invitation ‚Äì on environmental grounds.  Some people compensate for the emissions from their flights by buying a carbon offset. But this is a bit of a cod. Trees, for example, need years to grow enough to reabsorb the carbon from your flight, and there‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll be left standing long enough to counteract your flight emissions.  That kind of thing is for the wealthy who continue contributing to climate change, offsetting, but not changing their behaviour.  The solution to destination weddings? Elope. Just the two of you.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjaG9saXZlLmllL2Nvcmt2aWV3cy9hcmlkLTQxMTQwMzk5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Alyssa and Duncan were matched on the experiment together and after a series of ups and downs, Duncan eventually called it a day on their relationship.  Talking about her MAFS Australia wedding, Alyssa told Hello!

When is she going to tell him?‚Äô And I said, ‚ÄòWell guys, I was really upfront and honest, I told him straight away!‚Äô I literally do not know why they didn‚Äôt show it,‚Äù Alyssa explained about their wedding on MAFS Australia.  Duncan has recently moved on from Alyssa and is now in a relationship with his co-star Evelyn Ellis. The happy couple announced the news in a Honesty Box session with 9Entertainment and it was incredibly wholesome.  ‚ÄúAll of a sudden we went on a couple of nights, and some of the warm fuzzy feelings happened in my stomach and I thought, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs this?

The current world champion F1 driver was racing as part of his virtual F1 Team Redline streaming with another member Chris Lulham.  Verstappen apparently decided to join the competition at the last minute after Lulham had complained about the amount of work he had to do for his upcoming exams.  Lulham was on the call talking with Verstappen while the F1 driver took part in the race.  During the race Lulham tries to defend himself saying: ‚ÄúIf I had raced I would have had to rock up with like five hours break.‚Äù  However, Verstappen quickly cuts him off saying: ‚ÄúI cancelled a wedding for it.‚Äù  Lulham suggests that Verstappen was happy to cancel his plans though saying: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd rather be doing.‚Äù  To which Verstappen replies: ‚ÄúI love sim racing, but sometimes you have to think about the greater good.‚Äù  Verstappen has previously shown that he is almost as passionate about virtual F1 racing as he is about the real deal.

Quoting from the comedy Borat, he recalls, ""My first thought was, 'Wa-wa-wee-wa!' I didn't know what to think. She looked incredible ‚Äì stunning!"" Familiar faces from Jono And Ben, 7 Days and Funny Girls, the lovebirds ‚Äì known together as comedy duo Two Hearts ‚Äì married on 30 December 2022 at Nadia Lim's Royalburn Farm in the Crown Ranges near Arrowtown.  A-list guests, including Hilary Barry, Rose Matafeo, Chris Parker, Brynley Stent, Tom Sainsbury and Hayley Sproull, descended on the Queenstown-Lakes District for three fun-filled days of festivities. Laura laughs, ""We seriously considered eloping because we felt huge pressure to have this amazing wedding!""  The blooming gorgeous bride gets a cuddle from Rose.  Fortunately, the spectacular day went off without a hitch ‚Äì and Laura, 32, and Joseph, 34, are now Zooming in to chat about it from Australia after sell-out gigs at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. By the time you read this, they'll have performed in Wellington. And this week, it's Auckland's turn to see their show Til Death Do Us Hearts, which they describe as ""an intimate evening of songs about love, life and maintaining a successful relationship with your co-worker"". But back to the wedding‚Ä¶ The fun-loving couple wanted their big day to be full of excitement and surprises for everyone, so it started with a laugh-a-minute bus ride to the venue, featuring some of their favourite pop songs and hilarious mock commentary from a voiceover artist who introduces the fireworks at Disneyland. Joseph jokes he spent ""five times longer"" on this part of the wedding than he did his vows! Former Seven Sharp reporter Laura has stayed good friends with Nadia ever since the 2019 season of Dancing With The Stars and says the MasterChef judge's farm, with its stunning views out to Lake Wakatipu, made for a ""special"" venue. She adds, ""I went to Nadia's the night before and they've got a little apartment I stayed in. Nadia was heavily pregnant at the time, but she still made me dinner, which was so cute!"" Laughing, Joseph jokes, ""It was just a My Food Bag.""  The bride with pregnant pal Nadia and her husband Carlos Bagrie.  The ceremony was sweet and simple ‚Äì the only real tradition they followed was Laura spending the night apart from her groom. She explains, ""We spend our lives so deeply intertwined. This was the one thing we could do to be like, 'OK, let's build this up!'"" Being reunited at the altar was a powerful moment. An uncharacteristically serious Joseph says, ""We're always going to treasure that memory."" They both get emotional recalling groomsmen Paul Williams (Taskmaster NZ) and Nic Sampson (The Brokenwood Mysteries) bursting into tears. Joseph adds, ""I really like that we made a lot of our friends cry to a Jason Derulo song!"" True to their nature, a few details were left to the last minute. Joseph says, ""I remember I emailed the suit makers, 'Hello, I'd like one wedding suit please,' and they replied, 'When's your wedding?' When I told them it was in a month, they were like, 'But we have to make it in Italy!'"" Fortunately, it arrived three days before they left for Queenstown.  The bridal party (from left): Alice Harbourne, Simone Nathan,  Steph Badham, Eli Matthewson, Brynley Stent and Zara Cormack.  Similarly, Laura says, ""We both wrote our vows the night before the wedding."" She'd sought help from newlywed comedian Chris, who told her, ""The vows will just come to you."" She says she and Joseph often have to write jokes under pressure for work, adding, ""That's when our best stuff comes out!"" The reception was under a huge tent decorated with fairy lights and flowers. There were games, speeches, drinks and  a vegetarian dinner. As for the first dance, Laura says, ""We didn't do a big, choreographed number, which a few people were expecting, but we did a cute sway side to side."" The party went on into the early hours of the morning, with dancing, singing and a saxophonist playing alongside the DJ. ""It was really going off!"" Laura exclaims delightedly. And then it was round two of partying the next day for New Year's Eve, with the newlyweds heading off on honeymoon to Hawaii. ""It rocked ‚Äì I had the best time!"" declares Laura, prompting Joseph to ask, ""The honeymoon or the wedding?"" ""Both!"" Laura quickly chirps, adding that Disneyland was also on the itinerary ‚Äì a visit that inspired a song in Til Death Do Us Hearts, which is part of the New Zealand International Comedy Festival.  The newlyweds honeymooned in Disneyland.  The pair first performed as a duo, but just as friends, back in 2017, with the final song in their act being about how they would never end up together. Now they're performing in Aotearoa for the first time as husband and wife, although they insist not much has changed. ""We're still renting with a flatmate and our lives are still very much the same, but it's nice to call him my husband now and to celebrate the milestones,"" says Laura. Joseph agrees, explaining that the main reason for them getting married was to create ""memories of such a special day with family and friends"". ""The lead-up to the wedding was so stressful,"" adds Laura. ""We thought, 'What are we doing?!' But then we had the wedding and were like, 'Hell, yeah, that was absolutely worth it!'"" Clearly still besotted with each other, Laura and Joseph pause when asked what's coming up for them. Laura is pensive. ""I guess we're in a phase of deciding what to do next with our lives,"" she reflects, adding that sell-out Aussie shows and one of their videos going viral in Europe have made moving overseas a temptation. International audiences are very vocal, tells Laura.  You can see their love for real in Til Death Do Us Hearts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vd3RvbG92ZS5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2VkZGluZ3MvbGF1cmEtZGFuaWVsLWpvc2VwaC1tb29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTQ3MDUx0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm93dG9sb3ZlLmNvLm56L2FtcC9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2VkZGluZ3MvbGF1cmEtZGFuaWVsLWpvc2VwaC1tb29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTQ3MDUx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Of course, that required a little trickery.  Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in January 2021. In an April 2021 social media post announcing their union, the couple said they felt ‚Äúchuffed about it.‚Äù (Chuffed is British slang for ‚Äúvery pleased.‚Äù)  ‚ÄúFor the record: this is me gushing,‚Äù Gadsby wrote in the caption. ‚ÄúI am full of very positive feelings. This is a nice story.‚Äù  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  In their new special, which Gadsby describes as ‚Äúa feel-good show,‚Äù the comedian shares more details about their wedding, including the story behind their hilariously non-traditional novelty wedding cake.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake,‚Äù Gadsby explains in Something Special, ‚Äúand it worked.‚Äù  Gadsby recently shared a photo of the cake in question on their Instagram. It features a massive shark about to devour two adorable otters swimming serenely side-by-side.  ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòNah, mate, that‚Äôs not a wedding cake. I‚Äôm turning 10,‚Äô‚Äù Gadsby recalls in their special. ‚ÄúEasy. So gullible. Will believe anything, Christians.‚Äù  Cakes have, of course, become one of the most unexpected battlegrounds in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. (Just imagine what Harvey Milk or veterans of the Stonewall uprising would‚Äôve said if you told them that, in 2023, we would be suing bakers over cakes.)  In probably the most famous instance of cake discrimination, Jack Phillips, the anti-gay owner of Colorado‚Äôs Masterpiece Cakeshop, sued the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) in 2015 after it told him that his refusal to provide an LGBTQ+ couple‚Äôs wedding cake violated the state‚Äôs law prohibiting businesses open to the public from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Phillips, but did not rule on the question of whether he had a First Amendment right to refuse to make a gay wedding cake.  Phillips was sued again in 2018, this time by a trans customer for whom he refused to make a cake celebrating both her birthday and her anniversary of coming out as trans. In 2021, a Denver judge ruled that Phillips illegally discriminated against Autumn Scardina when he refused to make the cake. Earlier this year, the Colorado Court of Appeals again ruled against Phillips in the case.  More recently, in Florida, a Publix grocery store refused to write ‚ÄúTrans People Deserve Joy‚Äù on a cake for a trans nonprofit organization. The company later apologized, claiming that employees at the Orland-area store were mistaken in believing that writing a trans-affirming message on a cake was against corporate policy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3F1ZWVyLWNvbWVkaWFuLWhhbm5haC1nYWRzYnktdHJpY2tlZC1hLWNocmlzdGlhbi1iYWtlcnktaW50by1tYWtpbmctdGhlaXItd2VkZGluZy1jYWtlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Bell Tower on 34th has also opened this new boutique, smaller outdoor ballroom space to offer smaller wedding parties a more intimate space that encourages close connection between guests.  More information is available at https://thebelltoweron34th.com  Responding to the trend for more intimate weddings, where the bride and groom really get the opportunity to share their special day with their loved ones, The Bell Tower on 34th has created an open-air, outdoor ballroom that is suitable for small parties and for micro weddings with 50 guests or fewer. The event planners at The Bell Tower on 34th believe that, for small weddings, their new outdoor ballroom is both open and airy, which creates a sense of spaciousness, with room to eat, drink and dance, without feeling cavernous or empty.  With their new outdoor ballroom space, The Bell Tower on 34th can still offer guests the same high-quality personalized service that characterizes the larger weddings they have become known for.  As a part of their new intimate small wedding packages, The Bell Tower on 34th will offer couples the food service of their in-house executive chef and award-winning catering team. Small and micro wedding hosts can also now enjoy the support and assistance of their experienced and dedicated in-house wedding coordinators.

The Bell Tower on 34th believes that small doesn't have to be synonymous with 'less'. They are confident that their new outdoor ballroom, which is framed by their Instagrammable Mediterranean hacienda-style historic venue and beautiful garden setting, will create an intimate and boutique experience for brides and grooms who are interested in tying the knot in Houston.  Angela Nicholson Igo, the property's VP/Director of Marketing and Advertising said, ""The Bell Tower on 34th is known for our location's amazing beauty and for our attentive service leading up to and throughout your big day, from your ceremony to your cocktail hour and reception.

This category includes everything from appetizers that circulate during the cocktail hour to late-night snacks ‚Äî and, of course, the wedding cake.  Given the tradition of the bride and groom cutting the cake together, many couples are very particular about their wedding cake. That means they're often willing to pay a bit extra for a truly show-stopping creation. However, the most expensive slice of wedding cake ever sold probably isn't something you'd want to consider eating ‚Äî given that it was over 80 years old at the time of sale.  Back in 1998, two individuals in San Francisco made Guinness World Records history. Their feat? Shelling out a staggering $29,900 U.S. dollars in order to purchase a single piece of wedding cake, packaged in a box and sold at auction. Though the crew at Sotheby's figured the sweet treat from decades past would fetch somewhere between $500 and $1,000, Benjamin and Amanda Yin were willing to pay a whole lot more for the item.  In truth, they were buying a slice of history. The piece of the cake in question was served at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937. The couple relished the romance that the purchase represented. They were willing to pay top dollar for a slice of cake that they would never even get to taste because of its connection to the historic event.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTI4ODA3OS9tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1zbGljZS13ZWRkaW5nLWNha2Utc29sZC1kZWNhZGVzLW9sZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Many brides fantasize about walking down the aisle in a gown that looks like it belongs on the set of ‚ÄúBridgerton‚Äù or ‚ÄúQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.‚Äù This fantasy can now become a reality thanks to Allure Bridals‚Äô new line of dresses. The premier wedding designer is collaborating with Shondaland to create gowns that are fit for a Queen herself ‚Ä¶ Queen Charlotte, that is.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Inspired by the sumptuous gowns in the Bridgerverse, these gowns will be a modern and wearable take on the dresses we drool over on ‚ÄúBridgerton‚Äù and ‚ÄúQueen Charlotte.‚Äù  The Queen Charlotte gowns from Allure Bridals will be designed by none other than Shondaland‚Äôs Lyn Paolo. Paola has worked on many Shonda Rhimes‚Äô projects, including ‚ÄúHow to Get Away with Murder‚Äù and ‚ÄúScandal,‚Äù and most recently served as Costume Designer for ‚ÄúQueen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI love the worlds that [Shonda] creates and it is an absolute delight to fill those worlds with beautiful costumes,‚Äù Lyn Paolo, Shondaland‚Äôs creative director and designer, said in a press release. ‚ÄúNow I am excited to help design beautiful gowns inspired by the world she has created for today‚Äôs beautiful brides.‚Äù  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Though the collaboration shared Paolo‚Äôs sketches of the gowns ahead of their release, the Allure Bridals x Shondaland wedding gowns won‚Äôt be available until December 2023.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:50:00","A wedding bouquet is perhaps the most important and iconic accessory a bride wears to the big day. Designed to tie in bridal attire with the ceremony aesthetic, this arrangement of florals brings a whimsical touch to the bride's aesthetic. Designers can get quite creative and create bouquets big and small for brides to walk down the aisle with that feature a wild melange of blooms or just a singular kind of flower. While the types of florals used within a bouquet can vary greatly, there are a few more popular blooms and filler flowers used in this wedding arrangement. However, these are usually accented with less common ones for intrigue.  ""Floral designers today strive for innovation, especially in the era of social media,"" shares floral designer Shean Matthew Strong. ""It is crucial to create floral art pieces that truly showcase their talent. As a designer, incorporating unique elements is always a safe bet. This could be as simple as including herbs like mint, rosemary, or lavender in a bouquet, or something more captivating like a Hellebore, anthurium, or garden roses.""  Meet the Expert Shean Matthew Strong is a wedding and event floral designer. He is the owner and founder of Shean Strong Design.  Want to learn what are the most popular florals found in the wedding bouquet? Read ahead to learn about standout blooms and filler flowers often used in this iconic arrangement.  Photo by Amy and Stuart Photography  Popular Bouquet Flowers  Larger flowers with structure and plenty of petals are often the primary florals you will find in a wedding bouquet. One of the most popular types of flowers used in all kinds of weddings arrangements are roses. Found in hues ranging from bright whites to light pinks to deep reds, a rose is a timeless wedding bloom that can help your bouquet tie into your palette. A commonly used alternative to this bloom is ranunculus. These florals can add texture and movement to a bouquet thanks to their ruffly petals.  Show-stopping peonies are just as popular as roses, thanks to their distinct colorful petals. However, this temperamental flower only really blooms from April to June, so just springtime couples can utilize them in their bouquet designs. Large dahlias are a popular alternative for couples who want this face flower from mid-summer through the fall. For a hardy bloom that can ground an arrangement, floral designers also like to turn to hydrangea.  Looking for a lighter floral with movement? ""When aiming for a bouquet with a delicate fragrance and captivating beauty, Japanese Sweet Pea is a perfect choice,"" notes Strong. ""Its gentle scent and flouncy petals form a soft and feminine shape that is both timeless and romantic."" Long-stemmed anemone are fun to incorporate for a modern bouquet, while orchids are popular if a bride wants to create a cascading bouquet.  Certain flowers are more common in bouquets of a single variety. Calla lilies are an elegant, trumpet-shaped bloom often found solo and tied with a beautiful ribbon for a bridal accessory. Lily of the valley is also popular for this style of arrangement.  Photo by Lucy Cuneo  Popular Filler Flowers  While certain blooms stand out as the face flowers of a bouquet, other florals and greenery are incorporated to add dimension to these arrangements. In fact, some of these blooms can be the star of the show. ""A flower that is often underrated but can add depth and movement to arrangements is the lisianthus,"" says Strong. ""When used skillfully, the color variations in its petals allow this once-considered 'filler flower' to take on the role of a 'dancing flower,' bringing the much desired sense of movement to bouquets.""  Another popular wedding filler flower of the moment is baby's breath. With light white blooms and plenty of volume, baby's breath is commonly used throughout wedding arrangements. While normally a filler, you can find modern brides and bridesmaids carrying bouquets of this flower on its own.  For smaller blooms, carnations are commonly used as accents to a bouquet. Since they are available year-round and are quite durable, they are a safe bet to include in your arrangement. Spray roses are also a nice addition when looking for a petite floral.  ""Don't hesitate to experiment with unique textures,"" advises Strong. ""Eucalyptus can provide interesting colors and shapes, clematis adds a touch of garden charm, dates create a cascading effect, and hyacinths offer a cluster of texture and color. Embracing a variety of flowers can elevate the overall appeal of your floral designs.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vcG9wdWxhci1mbG93ZXJzLXVzZWQtd2VkZGluZy1ib3VxdWV0cy03NDk4NTU40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The real estate agent is also musically inclined and used to dance until he moved to selling homes in California.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 23:19:05","Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.  ‚ÄúAsk Anna‚Äù is a sex column. Because of the nature of the topic, some columns contain language some readers may find graphic.  Dear Anna,  Advertisement  I‚Äôm currently planning my wedding to the wonderful man of my dreams. The process itself is less than thrilling but we‚Äôre working together as a team to tackle all the little logistical things and hurdles. A problem that I didn‚Äôt anticipate, however, is the feelings I‚Äôm having when people RSVP no ‚Äî in particular, only one person from my family is coming, my sister. I love that I‚Äôll be surrounded by friends on my big day, but I can‚Äôt help but feel hurt that my family, who I thought would show up for me, isn‚Äôt coming. I‚Äôve certainly been invited to weddings that I wasn‚Äôt able to attend for financial or scheduling or COVID reasons, so I know it‚Äôs likely not personal, but it feels personal. How can I deal with this and focus on what truly matters ‚Äî that I‚Äôm going to celebrate the love of my life? ‚Äî Being Rigid In Demanding Expectations  Dear BRIDE,  Advertisement  First off, congrats on snagging the man of your dreams! It‚Äôs not everyday that you find someone worth spending your life with, so big ups to you two ‚Äî I wish you every happiness.  It‚Äôs totally valid to feel hurt that people you care about can‚Äôt make it to your big day. Weddings are, in many ways, extremely loaded events and we attach way more meaning, disappointment and weight than they deserve. That‚Äôs not your fault ‚Äî society tells us that this one day is THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF OUR LIVES. How can we not fall short of such a ridiculous ideal? (We can‚Äôt.)  And, really, it‚Äôs just a party. A very expensive party.  Remember also that weddings are a giant, love-fueled jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes the pieces just don‚Äôt fit perfectly for everyone. (Sometimes not even for you.)  So, how do you deal with the hurt feelings without letting it hinder the love fest that awaits you and your future spouse? Here are a few tips:  Allow yourself to grieve: Let yourself feel all the things you‚Äôre feeling. Whether you‚Äôre hurt, pissed off, depressed or perhaps all of those things at once, the fastest way to deal with feelings is to simply feel them. Don‚Äôt push them away or shove them down. Open yourself to the pain, let it core and dismantle you. Then, once the storm has finished raging inside of you, dust yourself off and keep going. Feelings are always temporary. They pass. Remembering that will help you when you‚Äôre feeling the lowest lows.  Something that helped me when I was grieving the death of my father (admittedly somewhat different than your conundrum but not entirely) was to set aside five minutes a day, in the morning usually, to just think about him. Sometimes I would journal but usually I would just ugly-cry. When I allowed myself the space to feel the full weight and depth of my agony, I was surprised at how quickly the feelings moved on. Eventually, I only had to do the ritual every other day, then once a week, and now I do it only very occasionally, on his birthday and death day. You might try a similar ritual to feel the pain and disappointment you‚Äôre experiencing around your family.  Embrace the sisterly love: Then, practice a little gratitude for the family that is coming. Your sister‚Äôs got your back and will be there to celebrate with you. That‚Äôs not nothing. Plus, you two can bond even more during this special time, which will make your relationship closer.  Advertisement  Remember other ways your fam has shown up for you: When I‚Äôm feeling especially disappointed by someone who‚Äôs important to me ‚Äî and literally everyone is disappointed by their families at some point! ‚Äî I try to remember all the other ways they‚Äôve shown up for me in the past, whether it was offering encouragement, sharing time or space with me, buying a book, being there for me during a hard time or even giving me cash when I desperately needed it.  People show their love in vastly different ways at vastly different times ‚Äî love isn‚Äôt a one-and-done thing. It moves. So, while it stings that this particular time certain people can‚Äôt show up for you, it doesn‚Äôt mean they never have or never will again.  It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs them: As you said yourself, people have their reasons for not attending, and most of the time, it has nothing to do with you. Life gets in the way, and that‚Äôs OK. Just remember that their absence doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt care about you. Tell yourself a better story.  Quality over quantity: Spend a little time fixating on the amazing friends and loved ones who are coming to your wedding. They‚Äôre the ones who‚Äôll be dancing the night away with you, toasting with you and sharing in all your wedded bliss. That‚Äôs worth celebrating.  In queer parlance, we call them chosen family ‚Äî they‚Äôre our ride-or-dies, they show up for us in the middle of the night, they bring us food when we‚Äôre sick, they read and edit our sexts, they love us unequivocally when our family or society has rejected us because of who we love or who we are. It‚Äôs a bond more powerful than blood because it‚Äôs a choice. A daily, intentional f‚Äî yes! Honor those people in your life. Let them be your family.  Virtual love: If some family members can‚Äôt physically be there, you could also consider setting up a livestream or video chat to include them in the festivities. That way, they can still share in the joy of your big day.  Advertisement  Keep perspective: At the end of the day, your wedding is a celebration of the love between you and your soon-to-be spouse. As long as you two are there, that‚Äôs what truly counts. The greatest gift of all is that you‚Äôre marrying the love of your life! And nobody can take that joy from you.  Happy planning, BRIDE!

Luckily, she later reconnected with Sam Joel at a co-worker‚Äôs going away party. Or, maybe it wasn‚Äôt luck. ‚ÄúA psychic had predicted this meeting, in detail, to me,‚Äù Matty shares. The psychic also told her that Matty and her soulmate had been split from the same atom and met countless times before in previous lifetimes. This lifetime was to become the one they'd got married in.  Even though she certainly knew Sam was the one, Matty didn't know the proposal was coming. ‚ÄúSam is a master of surprise,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe got engaged on the rooftop garden of Sam‚Äôs cherished grandmother‚Äôs Midtown apartment in October 2018. Sam‚Äôs dad, a professional photographer, was waiting in the wings to capture the moment. When we walked back into the apartment, Sam had invited an intimate circle of family and friends to surprise me.‚Äù They celebrated with a custom menu at one of Matty‚Äôs favorite restaurants.  When it came to wedding planning, they started with what they didn‚Äôt want. ‚ÄúIn our first meeting, I told planner Allison Jackson how important it was for our guests to feel comfortable,‚Äù Matty recalls. ‚ÄúI wrote out a list of everything I ever hated about going to weddings, and asked her if we could eliminate or improve on as many of those things as possible. I wanted the vibe to be Friday night at your favorite bar in New Orleans‚Äîbut in the mountains. I love the aesthetic of Jack Rose, a restaurant in the Pontchartrain Hotel in New Orleans, so that‚Äôs where we had our meeting.‚Äù  The venue, at least, was a no-brainer. ‚ÄúThe Matalin-Carville family farm‚Äîbuilt in 1753, and bought by Matty‚Äôs parents six months before Matty was born‚Äîis where Matty and her sister spent their early years,‚Äù the couple shares. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs where they always gathered for the most important and special events in their lives.‚Äù The bride's wedding would be no different. From there, the couple pegged vendors who matched their creativity and enthusiasm for doing something unexpected. ‚ÄúWe wanted to think really out-of-the-box and have a lot of fun,‚Äù they say. Of course, nods to their psychic-predicted meeting and soulmate status were woven into the celebration.  Read on to see all the playfully unique details of Matty and Sam‚Äôs November 6, 2021, wedding day, planned by Allison Jackson of Pineapple Productions and photographed by Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The palette was pulled from ‚Äúcolors of nature, autumnal jewel tones, and a variety of textures,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúWe love bird watching together in Audubon Park in New Orleans, so we incorporated a bird motif throughout.‚Äù  While this lead to a beautiful invitation design, getting them to guests was a challenge. They changed their date due to the pandemic, then the new invites were shipped during hurricane season in Louisiana, where many of their 250 guests reside. ‚ÄúOur invitation send-out unfortunately coincided with Hurricane Ida, so everyone‚Äôs mail was disrupted and many were evacuated for long periods of time. Some folks‚Äô hard copy of the invitation arrived a month after our wedding,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúTo all future brides, I would recommend the practice of perspective and laughing at the things you just can‚Äôt control.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much, and that their presence at our wedding means so much.  Photo by Kate Headley  The personalized touches was endless, and the couple took on quite a few DIYs. ‚ÄúThe best example would be our guest goody bags,‚Äù they say. ""We had fun cups made with our name and date; gave out copies of Matty‚Äôs grandmother‚Äôs cookbook; and even had T-shirts made that said, ‚ÄòSomeone in the Shenandoah Valley Loves Me.‚Äô Was it cheesy? Sure. Did we care? Hell no! We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much. We know things have been difficult for everyone and their presence at our wedding means that much more because of it.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  For her bridal attire, Matty paired a crepe Sarah Seven gown with an overskirt by Alexandra Grecco. ‚ÄúI had long been a fan of Sarah Seven; all her gowns are so chic,‚Äù the bride says. ""It was the first one I tried on, and my heart knew immediately. I paired it with the overskirt at the suggestion of my sister‚Äîthe most stylish person I know‚Äîand I fell in love with the combo. The other key was trying it on with the cathedral-length veil. I also wore a bow from my mother‚Äôs wedding gown, which she hand-sewed onto the back of my skirt.‚Äù  Matty's makeup look was effortlessly beautiful, with hair was inspired by her mother. ‚ÄúMy mom wore a Vera Wang headband on her wedding day, and I wanted to mirror that with a white headband that I had [our florist] decorate with fresh flowers,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúIt felt really glam and fun, and my hair was out of my face so I could dance all night.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  ‚ÄúThe best, best accessory was the homemade flower crowns my cousin made for all the kids,‚Äù Matty shares. ‚ÄúHer daughter was one of our flower girls, and she was sure to model it like a pro and show the other kids how to wear it with enthusiasm. We also had cute little signs for our kiddos to wear down the aisle‚Äîthings like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just here for the cake!‚Äô and ‚ÄòHas anyone seen the rings?‚Äô It added levity and humor in a serious moment.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  As guests entered the ceremony space, they were greeted with warm spiked local apple cider and savory parmesan rosemary shortbread. ‚ÄúThe focal point of our ceremony decor was the floating chuppah, which was designed by Amaryllis Floral & Event Design. The die-cut wood chuppah frame was suspended from the poles of our sailcloth tent,‚Äù Matty describes. ""The corners of the chuppah were adorned with silk ribbons. During our ceremony, special friends and family members pinned photos of lost loved ones to the ribbons.‚Äù To make the event more intimate and inclusive, they set their ceremony in the round.  Photo by Kate Headley  Matty‚Äôs dad, James Carville‚Äîa well-known political strategist, commentator, and author‚Äîwalked her down the aisle to the sounds of ‚ÄúStand by Me‚Äù strummed by a string quartet. Her mother, meanwhile, looked very chic in pink. ‚ÄúShe wore a Carolina Herrera dress and accessorized it with an Oscar de la Renta boa and vintage Givenchy opera coat,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúShe also carried a small posy of roses and dahlias, accented with peacock feathers, a symbol of good luck.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  There was no first look, as the bride and groom wanted to see each ofter for the first time at the ends of the aisle. ‚ÄúIt was amazing,‚Äù Matty shares. ‚ÄúI got the teary-eyed photo of Sam under the chuppah that I always wanted!‚Äù During the ceremony, ‚ÄúI loved sharing our Jewish faith traditions with Matty‚Äôs Catholic family, and I loved that they loved it,‚Äù Sam says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm also so glad we wrote our own vows. We really said everything we needed to say [and] made promises we‚Äôre excited to keep. To me, that‚Äôs the best way to start life together.‚Äù  Guests tossed birdseed and confetti at the newlyweds as they retreated down the aisle. ‚ÄúOur recessional was a traditional hymn, but it morphed into ‚ÄòJambalaya (On the Bayou)‚Äô by Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ray Charles, which my dad arranged as a surprise on our wedding day,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúGuests were dancing down the aisle as they made their way out of the tent to the cocktail hour.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  The newlyweds traversed the property to enjoy the first few moments as husband and wife, and took portraits with their photographer Kate Headley.

Guests filled swag bags and snapped photos in a vintage trailer during cocktail hour, while a Cajun zydeco band created a festive atmosphere. ‚ÄúWe had a variety of signature cocktails inspired by our family and friends,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúWe clipped fortunes to cocktails and served them with tarot card coasters as a fun nod to our psychic-predicted meeting.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  We melded NOLA‚Äôs spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of the Shenandoah Valley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The reception tent decor was inspired by Jack Rose, the New Orleans restaurant where they‚Äôd had that first meeting with their planner. ‚ÄúAllison suggested we approach the design by melding NOLA‚Äôs spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of Virginia‚Äôs Shenandoah Valley,‚Äù Matty says. ‚ÄúOur tent was draped in rich textured peacock-blue fabric and finished at the top with a patterned valance. Wrought-iron and gold-leaf lanterns with pillar candles, Southern smilax, and dripping jewel-toned flowers filled the ceiling of the tent for a whimsical and lush look.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  ‚ÄúA large oval mahogany bar featured decorative panels with a bold coordinating print,‚Äù Matty continues. ‚ÄúThe center of the bar housed a large shelving unit filled with botanicals and curiosities‚Äîeven a peacock, which is a known omen foretelling success and luck.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  The bandstand was created from a wooden wall painted brick red and decorated with disco balls and a neon sign reading ‚ÄúYou Belong Here.‚Äù  Photo by Kate Headley  Their semi-naked cake was adorned with sugar flowers, fresh figs, and Seckel pears‚Äîand there were more treats, as well. ‚ÄúOur groom‚Äôs cake was a delicious loaf of challah surrounded by honeycomb and fresh figs.

"wedding","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Dolores"", ""Peten"", ""Guatemala""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:11:43","The real reason Melissa and Joe Gorga skipped Teresa Giudice and Louie Ruelas' wedding has finally been revealed, and it's more sinister than you think!  All was made clear on the season 13 finale of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Tuesday, which saw Melissa share the ""big secret"" she said she's been keeping to herself the last six months.  Opening up the morning after the finale party, Melissa said that it all started with the rumor that Melissa was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband in the backseat of a car.  ""For the last six months, I've been trying to keep this big secret, because I was doing everything in my power to keep the family together,"" Melissa says.  ""I didn't want to say anything, because I was scared that they were going to ruin my wedding,"" Teresa goes on to claim.  The episode then flashes back to the night of Dolores Catania's Irish-themed, 1920s ""prohibition"" party, where everything came to a head.  Danielle Cabral breaks the news to Melissa that Margaret Josephs' former friend, Laura Jensen, told Jennifer Aydin and Teresa that Margaret has dirt on Melissa, claiming she was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband. It's then that Melissa stops Danielle and tells her she's already heard this story... from her own husband.  ""You wanna know how I heard it through my husband? 'Cause his sister called him over to her house secretly without me to tell him this story behind my back. Pretty f**ked up sister-in-law I have, isn't it?"" Melissa fires back.  The longtime RHONJ star proceeded to break things down in a confessional, calling the rumor ""baseless.""  ""Six months ago, Teresa called Joe over with Louie, because she heard a rumor about me, and she believes it so much, that she had to call her brother over. How dare you tell my husband that I would cheat on him?"" Melissa asks. ""You're saying this off a baseless rumor, from some woman who wants to hurt Margaret with no facts. No anything. Did she think he was just going to pack his bags and leave? Like, what the f**k are you doing?""  Fired up and frustrated at this point, Melissa tells Danielle that she should've called both Melissa and Teresa over to have this conversation. Danielle is confused by Melissa's claim that Teresa would want the cheating rumor to be true -- it becomes clear then that maybe Danielle isn't too well-versed in the years-long back-and-forth between Melissa and her sister-in-law.  ""Are you kidding me? Doll face, look at me. I have been accused of being a stripper. I have been accused of doing stuff in parking lots before,"" Melissa says. ""She's said multiple times, 'Your wife will leave you for a richer man.' She's said multiple things that we have let go in our life.""  Melissa shares that she had no intention of confronting Teresa about the meeting or the rumor because Joe himself doesn't believe it.  ""It's bulls**t and because I wanted to let her have a peaceful six months leading up to her wedding,"" Melissa says in a confessional. ""And look what ends up happening: she has her minion make me look bad in front of everyone, so everyone can hear the words 'Melissa's a cheater,' and I am done.""  Demanding to know why Teresa called Joe to the house to tell him about the alleged cheating, Melissa asks her sister-in-law for an explanation.  ""First of all, it wasn't his sister. It was Louie. He was like, 'I wanna tell your brother that all this is coming from Margaret, so your brother can get in front of it,'"" Teresa claims in a confessional. ""So, he was looking out for my brother. And I never repeated it to anymore.""  At this point, the entire party is heated, with fights breaking out amongst nearly everyone on the cast. The group begins to separate into their couples as they unpack what just happened. After getting the play-by-play from Melissa, Joe sets things straight in a confessional.  ""I get a call from Louie, 'What are ya doin'? I need to see you right away. It's very important.' So, I go to her house and Louie says, 'We heard that Melissa cheated on you.' I go, 'Guys, you got the wrong girl,'"" Joe tells the cameras.  Melissa starts to believe the altercation was all a set-up and tells the cameras that she thinks Teresa knew Danielle was going to tell her at the party.  After more back-and-forth and a heated argument between Joe and Louie, the group disbands, with everyone starting to make their way home for the night.  It's now the morning after the party and Melissa calls Dolores to go over the night's events, it's then she shares that she and Joe won't be going to Teresa and Louie's wedding.  ""Dolores, how can I go and celebrate someone else's marriage when they are the people that are constantly trying to destroy mine?"" Melissa says. ""I'm not doing it.""  Dolores tells Melissa if they don't go to the wedding, then she and Joe's relationship with Teresa is ""over-over,"" to which Melissa replies, ""It's been over.""  Already on the way to Teresa's house, Dolores tells Melissa that she plans to tell Teresa about her decision to skip the wedding. And she does just that, breaking the news to the couple, who are just days away from getting married.  ""They hate us,"" Teresa says after finding out about Melissa's decision. ""Obviously, they're not happy for us... This has been going on over 10 years. I dealt with it with my ex, I'm not going to deal with it in my new chapter of my life. I'm so done.""  Later in a confessional, Teresa says that she doesn't want a family ""like that,"" if this is the way things are going to be.  ""I know she's been wanting to get my brother away from me all this time,"" Teresa says of Melissa. ""She got her wish. She got her wish.""  The season ends with Melissa and Teresa in a worse place than viewers have seen them to date, signaling that things between this family may really be ""over-over.""  The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.

"wedding","1761-10-14","Not Discerned","{""Bridgeton"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:09:28","Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story opens with a disclaimer. ‚ÄúThis is the story of Queen Charlotte from Bridgerton,‚Äù the soothing voice of Julie Andrews reads as the text appears onscreen. That is to say: It is not the story of the real Queen Charlotte. ‚ÄúIt is not a history lesson,‚Äù the statement continues. ‚ÄúIt is fiction inspired by fact. All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional.‚Äù And while that is certainly the case‚Äîno one can truly know what went on in Charlotte and King George III‚Äôs relationship‚Äîsome parts of the show actually are true to life. This is particularly the case when it comes to Queen Charlotte‚Äôs wedding.  Queen Charlotte shows a 17-year-old Princess Charlotte being quickly married off to a 22-year-old King George, leaving her home in Germany and getting married the same day she arrived. That all actually happened. Here are some more details about the real royal wedding as they compare to the hit Netflix show.  Charlotte‚Äôs journey to England was pretty accurately depicted.  On the show, British royal representatives arrive in Mirow, the dukedom in northern Germany where Charlotte lived as Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her brother, Adolphus, signs the contract for Charlotte to marry King George III. Adolphus then makes the journey to England with Charlotte.  This is all true to life, but some details were missing. The official British royal family website explains that the escorts who arrived in Germany to collect Charlotte were led by the Earl of Harcourt. According to the site, the group didn‚Äôt leave right away. Instead, they were three days of celebrations, and then they returned to England with Charlotte where she would begin her new life.    While Queen Charlotte shows the future queen complaining of her uncomfortable outfit and whale bone corset, the journey was actually hard for a different reason. The royal family site notes that the voyage was difficult and the group faced three storms while crossing the North Sea. It also was a very long trip: They left Germany on August 17 and didn‚Äôt get to London until September 8.  While Charlotte and Adolphus are traveling, he mentions that their parents have died. This was also true, and the death of their mother was very recent‚Äîshe had died only three months earlier.  Charlotte got married the same day she arrived.  Queen Charlotte shows Charlotte and George getting married the same day that she arrives in England. And as surprising as it may seem, this is what actually happened.  ‚ÄúAt 9:00 p.m. the same evening, within six hours of arrival, the wedding of Princess Charlotte and King George III took place at the Chapel Royal, St James‚Äôs Palace,‚Äù the royal family site reads.  The show features a confrontation on the wedding day between Charlotte and George‚Äôs mother, Princess Augusta, in which they argue about Charlotte‚Äôs wedding dress‚Äîshe wants to wear the one she had made in Paris; Augusta wants her to wear an English-style dress. According to the Washington Post, the real George had requested that gowns be made for Charlotte and be ready when she arrived.  According to Percy Fitzgerald‚Äôs book, The Good Queen Charlotte (per Town & Country), for her wedding Charlotte ‚Äúwore ‚Äòan endless mantle‚Äô of rich violet and purple velvet, lined with ermine, over a white satin and silver dress.‚Äù In the show, she does wear a silver and white gown‚Äîjust without the purple velvet addition.  As for what wasn‚Äôt based on history...  A key part of the show is the fact that Charlotte is Black and the royal court becomes integrated thanks to her becoming queen. In reality, while there has been speculation that Charlotte had African ancestry, most historians agree that this idea lacks evidence and isn‚Äôt accurate. Instead, the show takes this idea and runs with it, which makes for an interesting story, but it means that the real wedding didn‚Äôt actually feature all the non-white members of the ton being invited to the royal wedding at the last minute.  As for other exaggerated or made-up moments, those are probably pretty obvious. Did Charlotte actually try to escape her fate as the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by climbing over a fence? Probably not, but it did make for a charming royal meet-cute with Farmer George.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90di9hNDM5MDcwMjEvcXVlZW4tY2hhcmxvdHRlLXdlZGRpbmctdHJ1ZS1zdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Doctor and TikToker Justin Tyler Fox gained over 9.1 million views, 2.3 million likes and 20,000 comments when he uploaded the wedding day confession to his account.  However, while many wedding day videos go viral for rather upsetting reasons ‚Äî like the bride who served her guests $48 bottles of antibloat pills at the reception, or the groom whose ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù wedding vows set off red flags all across TikTok ‚Äî Justin‚Äôs wedding day footage is making a positive impact on TikTok by touching people‚Äôs hearts (and raising the bar for vows from here on out).  Fox begins his viral vows by asking his bride, Raven, ‚ÄúDo you remember the day I knew for a fact I was going to marry you?‚Äù He then recalls the story for all their family and friends ‚Äî and now, for all the TikTok viewers at home.  According to Justin, he decided to marry Raven after a very special hiking trip ‚Äî and after her fateful fall attempting to follow him across a river.  When she took the nasty fall, he knew this was someone who would follow him to any place on earth, someone who would be by his side on every adventure and challenge.  Thus, to capture this very special moment, Justin secretly took a part of that day ‚Äî and a part of Raven ‚Äî and had it tucked away inside her ring.  Later, after proposing to Raven and putting the ring on her finger, she asked him, ‚ÄúWhat is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?‚Äù  Justin recalled explaining to her, ‚ÄúI told you, ‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs supposed to be,‚Äô and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day. Here‚Äôs my confession. That little stone in your ring is made out of dentine and enamel. When I picked it up that day, I went straight to the jeweler and I said, ‚ÄòCan you put this in my engagement ring?‚Äô‚Äù  Justin and Raven‚Äôs wedding guests were immediately moved by the story ‚Äî as were millions of TikTokers, who begged for a video of his full wedding vows (a wish Justin later granted).  Over 20,000 TikTokers were deeply moved by Justin and Raven‚Äôs story, and their love.  ‚ÄúIf his vows ain‚Äôt like this I don‚Äôt want him ü•πü§£,‚Äù laughed @ncsquared.  ‚ÄúThis ladies and gentleman are wedding vows!

It‚Äôs wedding season, y‚Äôall. That means you‚Äôre going to have to pony up and buy that flight to that oddly remote destination your friend picked for their wedding two and a half hours from the nearest airport. Great venue choice, Bud!  For many people, wedding season can come as an embarrassing experience of wearing the same navy suit and tie you‚Äôve had since high school graduation. Well, let me tell you, bro: It‚Äôs time to step up your game. Whether you‚Äôre going solo in hopes of meeting a bridesmaid or attending as a plus one to the event, you need to look your best. Fortunately, we‚Äôve done the research to help you figure out what to wear as a plus-one to a wedding if you don‚Äôt want to look like every other person there.  Advice on Matching Your Date: If you‚Äôre going with a date, you should complement them, but avoid matching their look exactly‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt your high school prom. If your date is wearing a certain color, choose accessories in similar or complementary shades or tones. For example, if your date is wearing a navy blue dress, opt for a different shade of blue, like sky or teal. If they are wearing pink or red, wear blue or green so that you complement each other but still look great when separated. And if they are wearing white, well then you wear whatever they told you to wear.  Try using a color wheel to match clothes and follow these few steps:  Choose one dominant color for your event outfit. Now, this could be a color that compliments your skin tone or just a color that you like to wear. Find the complementary color on a color wheel. This is the color opposite your dominant color on the wheel. Look for comparable colors on the color wheel. These could be the colors next to your dominant color or down the line in terms of shade. These analogous colors will help create a cohesive and harmonious look for your getup. Lastly, consider using neutral colors such as black, white, gray, or beige to balance out your outfit and leave room for small bits of flare.

The development speaks to an 872% increase in searches for handmade gifts on Etsy, indicative of a significant shift away from mass-produced items. The new platform, a game-changer for small businesses, is now live and accessible at Etsy.com/Registry.  What sets Etsy Registry apart is its support for independent creators and small businesses. It facilitates the selection of handmade, vintage, and personalized items, allowing couples to outline the precise customization they want. This makes Etsy a one-stop-shop for not only gifts, but also wedding decor and bridal party items.  Antoni Porowski, TV personality, and his fianc√© Kevin Harrington have endorsed the platform, curating their own gift registry filled with unique items from worldwide makers. ‚ÄúOne of the best parts about registering with Etsy is that you can choose custom, personalized gifts that never feel cookie cutter,‚Äù shares Antoni, hinting at the fun they had in curating their unique list of wedding items.  Alongside the launch of Etsy Registry, Etsy has also released its annual 2023 wedding trend guide. This year, couples are placing importance on fun and creativity, with unique twists on tradition taking center stage. Themes, elaborate programs, and unconventional bridal looks and rings are all part of the mix, adding to the excitement of saying ‚ÄúI do‚Äù.  Among the 2023 wedding trends identified by Etsy are Lovecore, Oversized florals, Western weddings, Love story gifts, and Rings with character. Lovecore sees an influx of heart patterns, roses, and red and pink hues, while Oversized florals incorporate rosettes and floral appliqu√©s to add texture and romance. Western weddings bring a laid-back, unconventional style, and Love story gifts promote personalized mementos that celebrate each couple‚Äôs unique journey. Rings with character is a trend that showcases individuality, with handmade, unique rings gaining popularity over traditional designs.  For small businesses in the wedding industry, these trends provide a roadmap for product development and marketing. It opens avenues for those skilled in crafting handmade and personalized items, floral designs, or western-themed goods to tap into a growing market. Similarly, businesses specializing in love story gifts can hone their product range and marketing strategies based on the current trends, attracting more customers seeking unique, meaningful presents.  It‚Äôs important to note that this shift toward personalized and meaningful wedding items isn‚Äôt just a trend, but a sign of a larger movement towards conscious consumption. As consumers become more aware of their purchases‚Äô impacts, they‚Äôre turning towards small businesses and independent creators who offer unique, handmade, and personalized items. The success of Etsy Registry could pave the way for a more diverse, personalized, and meaningful wedding gift industry, providing a significant boost to small businesses worldwide.  It‚Äôs clear that Etsy Registry is more than just a platform; it‚Äôs a statement on the future of the wedding industry. With its focus on personalization, creativity, and support for small businesses, Etsy is reshaping the way we think about wedding gifts and decor. And for small businesses, it‚Äôs an opportunity to connect with customers on a deeper level, offering products that are not only beautiful but meaningful as well.

(Valley News Live) - Casey Ford and his fiance Allison Torkelson are set to get married in September, but never could they imagine they would be forced to find a new venue and caterer, just months before the wedding.  Ford says, last February, he and his soon-to-be wife coordinated with Bigfoot Bar and Grill, which was operated out of the Ramada Inn in Grand Forks, to plan their wedding. He says they wrote out a $1,400 deposit check to Bigfoot to secure catering and the use of the Ramada Inn banquet hall.  ‚ÄúThey cashed it two to three weeks after that. Everything was fine. The communication was fine,‚Äù said Ford.  Although, everything did not turn out fine. Ford says he learned from social media that the business had closed.  ‚ÄúI found out on Facebook that they are splitting ways with Ramada. There was no communication there. I emailed them again saying, I found out through Facebook that you are splitting up. What‚Äôs the deal,‚Äù he said.  Ford says he learned of the closing through a posting on a Facebook group. The posting was from another soon-to-bride, who was having the same issue. Several screenshots were attached showing the woman‚Äôs many attempts to also contact Bigfoot to determine the fate of her wedding. The post accumulated more than 60 comments from others going through the same problem or those who have had less-than-desirable interactions with the business.  He also says there have been several attempts to contact Bigfoot‚Äôs owner since learning of the closure, but there has been little to no response.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried calling. I‚Äôve tried emailing. My dad has been doing things on his end in Grand Forks to try and get in contact and we‚Äôve just heard nothing.‚Äù  Not only was the couple out $1,400, they also had to find a new venue. All he wants now is to have the money refunded.  ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt feel good. $1,400 is a lot of money. That could go towards our wedding at the new place,‚Äù Ford said. ‚ÄúHaving to find out through a third-party source that they are splitting and we don‚Äôt have a wedding. Don‚Äôt have a location and we had to go to other venues. That 1,400 would mean a lot.‚Äù  Google listed Bigfoot as permanently closed. Also, when visiting the business website, the word ‚Äúclosed‚Äù is plastered across the homepage.  According to an article from the Winnipeg Free Press, Bigfoot‚Äôs owner Ty Cox was facing deportation from Canada in 2014 after he allegedly scammed a charity for kids out of $7,200. It‚Äôs unclear if he was ever actually deported.  A representative from Ramada Inn confirmed Bigfoot was no longer operating in their hotel. The representative says they were not made aware of the full list of weddings scheduled. Although, they state the hotel will honor the commitment to host some weddings in certain situations.  If there are couples who have coordinated their weddings with Bigfoot and still wish to host their event at the Ramada, you can contact Assistant Manager Tiffany at (701) 203-1714.  Our requests for comment from the owner of Bigfoot Bar and Grill have gone unanswered.  Copyright 2023 KVLY.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Norway"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 14:09:36","Q:  My fianc√©e and I are putting together the guest list for our wedding and we‚Äôve run into a social quandary. It will be a small wedding, and we want to invite two of our mutual friends who are married to each other. We mostly knew them as a monogamous couple, but since we moved to another state, they have become part of a polycule. We love our friends, and want everyone at this intimate gathering to feel comfortable. We‚Äôve never met the two newest people in their relationship, but they all seem to be getting more serious about each other. Should we invite just the two friends, or the whole polycule? How do we know when a +1 should actually be a +2 or +3?  A:  Hello! Fellow queer person currently planning a wedding here and experiencing intermittent guest list stress, so I am answering from that perspective! The simplified version of my answer is this: Basically, you can treat these friends the same way as you treat other friends who have maybe started new relationships where you don‚Äôt know their partners. Are you automatically inviting all of your monogamously partnered friends‚Äô partners even if you‚Äôve never met them before or don‚Äôt really have your own friendships with them? Then it might be the most ‚Äúfair‚Äù to consider inviting these friends‚Äô partners. If you have left off some friend‚Äôs partners who you don‚Äôt know, then it‚Äôs fine to leave these ones off, too, regardless of how serious the relationship is.  My slightly more complicated (or perhaps liberating for you ‚Äî idk!) answer is that you can invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. A lot of ‚Äúguest list‚Äù etiquette is outdated when it comes to +1s ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt mean in the sense that obviously old and heteronormative rules don‚Äôt take into account polycules or poly relationship structures but just in the sense that +1s in general don‚Äôt always need to be the default. Not everyone on the guest list for my wedding gets a +1 ‚Äî even for some folks who are monogamously partnered! My fianc√© and I basically went with our own personal ‚Äúrules‚Äù for +1s, which weren‚Äôt codified rules at all but just rather who we thought it made the most sense to invite. We have some friends who are newer to our lives, and it just didn‚Äôt make a ton of sense for us to invite their partners who we‚Äôve never met. We have some friends who we spend a ton of time with who never really bring their partners around, so in some of those cases, we also didn‚Äôt feel bad about not extending +1s. I have cousins in Norway who are invited who are married or otherwise in longterm partnerships whose partners are not invited, which I knew would be especially chill because Norwegians think Americans are kinda extra with all the +1 stuff at weddings.  The size of your guest list is the #1 determining factor for the cost of your wedding ‚Äî full stop. I don‚Äôt think anyone understands this until they‚Äôve planned a wedding themselves (myself included!), but the smallest adjustments to size can make a huge difference. It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust a few extra people‚Äù in a lot of cases; it automatically makes the price of food, drink, programs, etc go up. And if you‚Äôre planning a small wedding, then it makes it all the more true that small fluctuations would have a big impact. The thing that really stands out to me is that you‚Äôve never met these other people in the polycule. Except in a few very rare cases, my fianc√© and I aren‚Äôt inviting anyone who hasn‚Äôt been met by at least one of us.  Every time I experienced stress while working on our guest list, I had a helpful friend who reminded me that there‚Äôs no way to make everyone happy; you should focus on making yourselves happy. No one should be invited to a wedding solely because you feel socially obligated to do so. You have to come up with whatever ‚Äúrules‚Äù make the most sense for you ‚Äî and they can be amorphous like ours ultimately were.  Of course, no one should feel excluded just because they choose a polyamorous approach to their relationships. Ask yourself this though: If these two people who you‚Äôre both friends with had recently broken up and were now seriously dating new people, would you invite those new partners? If any of your monogamous friends broke up and started seeing new people, would you invite those new people, too? If the answer is yes without a doubt, then sure, go ahead and invite their full polycule. If the answer is no or you‚Äôre unsure, then maybe remind yourselves that what really matters is the people you‚Äôre closest to are at your special day, and sometimes that doesn‚Äôt include everyone those people are also close to.  Also, something that‚Äôs helpful to keep in mind is that there‚Äôs absolutely nothing wrong with guest +1s being on, for lack of a better phrase, a ‚Äúbackup list.‚Äù If you have enough people decline when they RSVP to your wedding, then perhaps you can add in extra +1s ‚Äî either for these friends or for other friends who are in new relationships or even for single friends who you think might benefit from a date. In general, my guest list has what I call a ‚Äúno randos‚Äù policy, which basically means no blanket +1s for folks ‚Äî except in a few individual cases where I know the person invited ONLY knows me and my fianc√© and I wanted them to have a buddy. See, this is what I mean by amorphous rules! Be flexible and not overly constrained by etiquette, which can be super rigid!  I totally understand the impulse of wanting to make sure your approach to social expectations are inclusive and fair, but I also think it‚Äôs okay to play by your own rules when it comes to a wedding and go with your instincts. So long as the decision is being made from a place of what you actually want and not what you think others expect of you, I think whatever choice you make is ultimately yours and doesn‚Äôt have to be defended to anyone. The fact that you‚Äôre asking this question in the first place signals to me that you take your friends‚Äô relationships seriously.  You can chime in with your advice in the comments and submit your own questions any time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9zdHJhZGRsZS5jb20vc2hvdWxkLWktaW52aXRlLW15LWZyaWVuZHMtd2hvbGUtcG9seWN1bGUtdG8tbXktd2VkZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The key to finding just the right look? Skip stilettos in favor of flat sandals and go for the best beach wedding guest dresses that are wearable and refined at once.  ‚ÄúLook for styles that are flowy, made with lightweight fabrics like linen and viscose to help to keep you cool, and that you can dance on the beach in all night,‚Äù Suzanne Smallshaw, senior director of fashion and styling at , tells Bazaar. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking for a more form-fitting dress, opt for one with breathable stretch, so you‚Äôre comfortable from the afternoon ceremony to sunset cocktails.‚Äù  Don‚Äôt be afraid to lean into bold, bright designs.

YEAH, WELL, THE HIDDEN FEES ARE PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. MAKING SURE THAT IF YOU ARE ABLE TO PAY IN 3 OR 4 INSTALLMENTS, WHICH MOST PEOPLE CANNOT, RIGHT, BECAUSE THERE‚ÄôS TERMS TO THAT, IT HAS TO BE PAYMENTS EVERY TWO WEEKS. WELL, IF YOU CAN‚ÄôT AFFORD IT WITH THIS PAYCHECK, YOU PROBABLY CAN‚ÄôT AFFORD IT WITH THE NEXT THREE PAYCHECKS EITHER. SO THAT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. YOU AND I HAVE BOTH PLANNED WEDDINGS. THEY EVERYTHING ADDS UP. AND AND I AM CONVINCED. I‚ÄôM CONVINCED THAT THE PRICES ARE EVEN HIGHER FOR THINGS LIKE. SO FOR NAPKIN, IT‚ÄôS ONE PRICE NORMALLY. BUT FOR A WEDDING NAPKIN, IT‚ÄôS LIKE TRIPLE 200% THE TOTAL AMOUNT. SO HOW DO PEOPLE SAVE? I MEAN, WHAT‚ÄôS THE ADVICE TO FOR PEOPLE WHO WHO WANT TO PREPARE NOW? YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. WELL, THE FIRST THING IS TO PLAN AHEAD OF TIME RIGHT? YOU ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU‚ÄôRE KIND OF WORKING BACKWARDS. IF YOU KNOW THAT THE AVERAGE LIKE RIGHT NOW, THE AVERAGE WEDDING IS COSTING 28,000, WHICH IS ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN PRE-COVID. RIGHT. BUT WE ARE BACK UP TO THOSE, YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY ALMOST $30,000. SO PLANNING AHEAD AND MAKING SURE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOU HAVE TO SAVE EVERY MONTH IN ORDER TO HIT THAT GOAL. AND FOR PEOPLE THAT GET MONEY AS A GIFT, WHAT SHOULD THEY BE DOING WITH THAT? HOW SHOULD THEY PLAN FOR THAT?

Each day this week, we‚Äôll be asking our resident ‚ÄúWediquette‚Äù expert and ‚ÄúLet Them Eat Cake‚Äù editor Melanie Spencer a frequently asked question or one from a reader.  Yesterday, we started the week off with a topic that can be tricky to navigate for many ‚Äì money. Click here to see if there is a minimum amount to spend on a wedding present.  Today, we‚Äôre covering a big fashion pet peeve of ours surrounding wedding guests.  Question: How much is too much white in a wedding outfit? Can I wear white shoes/white purse/accessories?  Answer: It‚Äôs OK if an outfit has some white in it. What we want to avoid is attire that‚Äôs more white than any other color. So, for example, a blue dress with white flowers is fine. But it would be best to avoid a white dress with blue flowers. This guideline is mainly about steering clear of upstaging the couple getting married, since traditionally at least one person often wears a white dress, pantsuit or what have you. When it comes to accessories, I would err on the side of no white (for shoes and purse especially), because if one or more person in the betrothed couple is wearing white, they will likely also use white accessories and, again, it‚Äôs best to avoid anything that could smack of upstaging. All of this being said, if the couple instructs guests to wear white (or any specific color), definitely do as they request, because they are clearly going for a look and a vibe and you don‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòthat guy‚Äô.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bmV3b3JsZWFucy5jb20vd2VkaXF1ZXR0ZS13ZWVrLWhvdy1tdWNoLWlzLXRvby1tdWNoLXdoaXRlLWluLWEtd2VkZGluZy1vdXRmaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Focus on what you want to use and see every day.  Much conversation surrounds the wedding itself ‚Äî the prep and planning for the Big Day and the related festivities are the topics du jour as couples consider the various elements of their union. But the wedding is the start of something new, and there should be some careful consideration of your life at home ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs what items to register for or how to ‚Äúmarry‚Äù interior design aesthetics.  Whether you move in together before or after ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù you‚Äôre bound to have too much of one thing, too little of another ‚Äî and some items that have to go. ‚ÄúTaking both aesthetics and blending them together is important,‚Äù says Maureen Block, of Mason Grey Interiors in Newtown Square. ‚ÄúThis is a new space that should reflect both personalities. Everyone should feel comfortable at home.‚Äù Here are Block‚Äôs tricks for settling in.  If you‚Äôre looking for more planning advice, check out our guides to nontraditional bouquets, stocking an N/A wedding bar, managing wedding stress, budgeting, size-inclusive wedding attire, and more.  1. Take inventory of everything. Knowing what you both have helps you see what you may need.  2. Know what the long-term shared goal for each area is. Making and agreeing on a plan to proceed room by room or space by space is key.  3. Set a budget, and don‚Äôt be afraid of using a designer. It‚Äôs an investment, but it can help save time and money in the long run. But remember, communication in any relationship is key ‚Äî especially  with your designer.  4. Consider your non-negotiables. Maybe it‚Äôs an oversize recliner that one of you must have but the other hates. Rather than arguing, design around it with great pillows or art pieces to draw the eye away.  5. When it comes to your registry, only bring into your home what you really love. Focus on the pieces you want to use and see every day.  What‚Äôs the Best Registry For ‚Ä¶  COZY-CHIC HOUSEWARES?  Head to Anthropologie in Rittenhouse. The store‚Äôs eclectic lineup of bedding and functional but fun cookware often gets overlooked for its clothing selection, but who doesn‚Äôt need a cake stand shaped like a lily pad?  CONSCIOUS ART?  Try South Kensington nonprofit InLiquid. The organization‚Äôs new registry¬≠ lets couples curate a selection of pieces from Philly artists at a variety of price points and styles. (Email Sara Zimmerman at saraz@inliquid.org to register.)  GIFTS FROM A GROUP?  Best for a couple that already has a home full of practical items ‚Äî Ilyan Jewelry in Haverford has plenty of sparkle. Perhaps your wedding party wants to go in on a chic charm to commemorate the day.

However, one woman said she pulled off her perfect day at a great price by hiring an unlikely caterer: Chili‚Äôs.  In a viral video, user @brideisapersonality explained how having Chili‚Äôs as her caterer saved her a ton of money.  ‚ÄúWe served Chili‚Äôs at our wedding and this is how much we spent,‚Äù the TikToker began the video.  In the background, she holds a receipt that features what the total was and everything she served to guests, including chips and salsa, salad, egg rolls, cajun chicken pasta, chicken tenders, sliders.  ‚ÄúOur total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis also includes five specialty meals that we did for people who were gluten-free, dairy-free, and can‚Äôt eat meat, and people who needed special items like no dairy, only seafood, etc.‚Äù  While the TikToker was thoroughly impressed with the price point for all of the food, she said she did run into unexpected hurdles. ‚ÄúWe had to pick it up pretty early because we didn‚Äôt want to pay the delivery fees,‚Äù she continued.  The TikToker said her wedding day also fell on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, and the restaurant prepared the food ahead of time to ensure the entire order could be fulfilled. This meant the food had to be rewarmed and set up by the bride, her family, and the servers she hired to wait on guests and help clean up.  ‚ÄúWe had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be like cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking. My coordinator had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn‚Äôt really supposed to do,‚Äù the TikToker said. ‚ÄúThat was just a lot more work than we had anticipated.‚Äù  Nonetheless, the TikToker said she was still happy with her choice.  ‚ÄúThe food was amazing,‚Äù she concluded. ‚ÄúIt was the perfect meal for our wedding.‚Äù  Her video was viewed over 1.3 million times. Some viewers criticized the bride for not simply having the food delivered and expecting her servers to do additional, unexpected labor. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,‚Äù user @mars wrote. ‚ÄúYou should have paid delivery.‚Äù  However, others applauded the bride‚Äôs decision to go with a cost-effective option that still makes guests happy.  ‚ÄúNormalize this,‚Äù a commenter wrote. ‚ÄúWeddings are so out of control! Such a great idea!‚Äù  ‚ÄúI would be so hype to find out the wedding food was Chili‚Äôs,‚Äù one user commented.  Chili‚Äôs also eventually chimed in with a simple comment on the bride‚Äôs video: ‚ÄúIconic.‚Äù  The Daily Dot reached out to @brideisapersonality and Chili‚Äôs for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxpcy1jYXRlci13ZWRkaW5nL9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxpcy1jYXRlci13ZWRkaW5nLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  GLASTONBURY, Conn. ‚Äî Spring is here and that means it‚Äôs officially wedding season.  The wedding industry is seeing a huge boost in business after the COVID-19 pandemic wrecked wedding plans for brides across the state.  Now venues are just catching up with their rescheduled weddings from the pandemic, and while life feels back to normal, the wedding industry has changed completely.  Before you say ""I do,"" you may find yourself as a bridesmaid instead of a bride.  ""We have more than we can handle, more than we could want, we turn people away but we give suggestions on where they can go,"" said Corrine Crocker-Luby, owner of the Tiffany Juliet House.  Finding a place to tie the knot is more stressful than ever before. Some brides are already booking into 2026.  Over at Glastonbury Hills Country Club, co-owner Frank Schroll said wedding dates are booking up years in advance.  ""We even get some brides that aren‚Äôt even engaged yet, they come out they know it's gonna happen soon and they want to do the leg work,"" said Schroll.  That leg work is harder than in years past.  All those pandemic-postponed ceremonies and receptions have backed up the bookings at venues around the country. All pieces and parts of the wedding industry are hoping brides and grooms have some flexibility.  ""We don‚Äôt want to hear brides have one date because more than likely it will already be taken,"" said Schroll.  That‚Äôs exactly what happened to Shannon Dolan.  ""I was thinking wedding planning starting about a year in advance was going to be fine but quickly we were learning some of the vendors were already booked,"" said Dolan.  Last summer, she found out ‚ÄúI do‚Äù is already planning to be said for every date for this October.  She decided on an unconventional approach to her big day. It's her own new booming business, the Mix and Mingle Mobile Bar. The drinks come to you, allowing brides to choose their wedding day in their favorite spot, on a budget. October it is for her big day, just with fewer guests than originally planned.  ""We‚Äôve been to some weddings that are smaller guest counts and they‚Äôre some of the most fun weddings we‚Äôve been to,"" said Dolan.  More weddings means post-pandemic love is in the air.  Back at the Tiffany Juliet House, owner Crocker-Luby has also been a wedding planner for more than two decades, now watching some relationships running right to the altar.  ""People are actually falling in love more after Covid and celebrating their union,"" said Crocker-Luby.  That means while it may be harder to lock down a time and place, couples are still celebrating their love, sometimes with just a big guest list cut.  ""After the pandemic people wanted to get together with their families so now we‚Äôre seeing a lot more intimate gatherings,"" said Tamie Myers, owner of Event Connoisseur Flowers and Gifts.  No matter the size, what‚Äôs a wedding with out flowers?  Myers' wedding business is, well, blooming.  ""Business is booming and people are looking to get back out there and have the interactions with their friends and family again,"" said Myers.  Brides and grooms are keeping the industry on its toes, trying to celebrate like normal is back in vogue.  ""I think we were cooped up too long for sure and it‚Äôs remembering what‚Äôs important in life and spending time with people you love,"" said Crocker-Luby.  Couples are finally surrounded again by family and friends, having their cake, and eating it too.  Lindsey Kane is a reporter at FOX61 News. She can be reached at Lkane@fox61.com.

Though wine on its own can make a great gift‚Äîespecially if it means something unique to the couple‚Äîit‚Äôs nice to pair the bottle with something extra special. Fortunately, we‚Äôre here to help take some of the stress out of the gift-giving process with plenty of expert tips.  First, you‚Äôll need to pick a great bottle of booze. ‚ÄúGiving a bottle from a vintage from the year the newlyweds met or got engaged is a fun idea and shows that you also pay attention to the milestones in their relationship,‚Äù says Janice Carnevale, event planner and wedding expert with Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C. ‚ÄúA custom case for them to open over several anniversaries would [also] be an incredibly thoughtful gift.‚Äù  Next, you‚Äôll want to determine what else you plan to gift the guests of honor. ‚ÄúMost often, we see wine given as part of a wedding gift, often accompanied by a gift of cash or sometimes accompanied by wine glasses,‚Äù says Sara Bauleke, wedding planner and designer at Bella Notte in Washington, D.C.  But before you begin browsing, be sure to check the couple‚Äôs registry to see if they have listed any wine-centric items, suggests Carnevale. ‚ÄúThey might have glassware, a [wine] opener or a chiller on their list, which would pair great with a bottle you pick for them,‚Äù she says.  Finally, as you search for the perfect wine-centric gift for the bride and groom-to-be, consider how much you want to shell out.  ‚ÄúGenerally speaking, couples will expect gifts in various price ranges depending on their financial situation,‚Äù says Jacqueline Vizcaino founder of Tinted Events Design and Planning in Atlanta.  Cathy O‚ÄôConnell, co-founder of COJ Events in La Quinta, California, recommends spending somewhere between $100 to $200 or more, but staying in the range of what you can afford. Remember, it‚Äôs the thought that counts. Also, keep in mind that this number can vary depending on how close you are to the couple.  Here, we break down some fantastic wedding gift ideas for wine lovers across an array of price points.  10 Best Wine Wedding Gifts  Personalized Vivid Decanter Any oenophile knows the importance of using a wine decanter. It is crucial when it comes to letting the vino ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù to enhance its aroma, flavor and texture‚Äîwhile also separating it from any solids or sediments.

The decanter is hand-made in Europe and constructed with lightweight, lead-free crystal for added durability.

Oh, and did we mention it can fit any standard-size bottle of wine or Champagne? The sliding plexiglass door, which has a hole in it, makes it easy to add and remove corks. Place a bottle of celebratory bubbly inside the gift box for an extra-special touch. $99.00 Wine Enthusiast  Marble and Solid Acacia Wood All-In-One Lazy Susan Cheese Board (14 Piece Set) Wine and cheese go together just as perfectly as your favorite soon-to-be-married couple, which is why you should consider gifting them this chic cheese board on their special day.

Each of the two storage zones can be individually set to 46¬∞F, 54¬∞F or 61¬∞F, depending on the type of wine (i.e., reds, whites, or roses). What‚Äôs more, the wine preserver and chiller simultaneously preserve, chill and vacuum seals already-open wine bottles so that they can be enjoyed for up to 10 days. And, thanks to its compact design, it can be easily stored on the couple‚Äôs kitchen counter for easy access to their favorite bottles. $399.00 Wine Enthusiast  L'Atelier du Vin Black Matte and Wood Lever Corkscrew Any drinker can benefit from having an extra corkscrew around the kitchen.

(Of course, it can also be used for other bottles, albeit not six of them.)

"wedding","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 10:04:59","It was a discreet wedding, with immediate family and a few other attendees. But, when a photograph of the happy couple and the details of the marriage were published, the union of the mayor of Arauc√°ria and his fifth wife became headline news in the city in the southern state of Paran√° and, in a heartbeat, all over Brazil. The wedding led to controversy as it took place four days after the bride turned 16, the minimum age in Brazil to legally marry with the permission of family or a judge, and because the groom is 65 years old. Eyebrows were also raised when it became known that the day before the ceremony the alderman had given his future mother-in-law a position in City Hall, appointing her councilor for culture. Despite the half-century age difference between the couple, it was this act of nepotism that raised the most outrage.  But despite the singular elements of this particular union, it is far from an uncommon event in Brazil. Last year, Brazilian notaries registered 12,509 marriages in which at least one of the participants was aged 16 or 17. That equates to 34 teenage spouses per day, the vast majority of whom were female.  A photograph of the beaming couple as Kauane Rode Camargo places a wedding ring on Hissam Hussein Dehaini swiftly went viral. The mayor‚Äôs political party moved quickly to disown him. And, in the face of a public backlash against the appointment of his mother-in-law, he soon dismissed her, although he initially pointed to her 26 years‚Äô experience in public service as proof of her credentials.  Almost a month after the marriage, the newlyweds remain the most talked-about subject among Arauc√°ria‚Äôs population of around 140,000. ‚ÄúAs anywhere, there are people who are for and against it,‚Äù says E. T., who asks to be identified by his initials in order to speak freely. ‚ÄúBut I have noticed that, because he is an excellent administrator, his supporters choose not to look at the negative side, that it [the marriage] is legal, but immoral. Many have congratulated them, and wished them good luck.‚Äù  E. T. knows Dehaini personally, but his wife only by sight. He points out that the mayor is a successful businessman with interests in hotels, gas stations and airline charters that have created many jobs locally (although E. T. also mentions Dehaini was arrested on suspicion of links to drug trafficking two decades ago, according to the website G1, part of the Globo group). In his personal life, he has been married on four other occasions and has 16 children. His current wife was a recent finalist in the Miss Arauc√°ria Teen 2022 pageant. Although it is a conservative city, Arauc√°ria also hosts a beauty contest for young girls in the style of the movie Little Miss Sunshine.  Hissam Hussein Dehaini and his 16-year-old wife Kauane Rode Camargo. RR SS  Perhaps the age difference between Dehaini and Camargo did not come as much of a shock because Brazil is well-accustomed to marriages between older men and much younger women. The political elite serve as an example: President Lula da Silva is 21 years older than his wife, Janja and his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, is 27 years older than his wife Michelle. The record, though, goes to Michel Temer, president from August 2016 to December 2018, who is 43 years older than his wife, Marcela, whom he met in 2002 when he was already a veteran politician, and she was a 19-year-old newly crowned miss.  The marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, while causing controversy, has served to renew the focus on child weddings in Brazil, which remains a widespread practice. But legal marriages performed before the relevant authorities are only the tip of the iceberg, says Ana Nery Lima, a gender specialist with the NGO Plan International, who says that ‚Äúinformal unions in Brazil are very normalized.‚Äù The United Nations estimates that 26% of Brazilian women live with a partner before they are 18, including 6% who are not even 15. ‚ÄúIn Brazil, when people hear the expression child marriage, they usually think of child brides of nine or 10 years old in India, but they don‚Äôt think of people they know, such as that neighbor, that aunt or their grandmother, who got married at 14,‚Äù says Lima. ‚ÄúIn the eyes of the United Nations, child marriage is a formal or informal union in which at least one of the parties is younger than 18.‚Äù In global terms, Brazil ranks fifth in the world in terms of child marriages, with 2.2 million people falling under this category. In percentage terms, however, it is not in the top 20 worldwide, a list headed by Niger where 76% of minors cohabit with a partner before the age of 18.  In Brazil, the main reasons for this phenomenon are socioeconomic and cultural. ‚ÄúWhen two minors marry, it is usually because she is pregnant and the family wants to protect the girl‚Äôs reputation. But there are also very poor families who have many children and who think: ‚ÄòLook, at least [in another family] she will have something to eat, clothes to wear,‚Äô‚Äù says Lima. ‚ÄúThen there is that deep-rooted, macho culture that young women are more attractive.‚Äù The specialist notes that in weddings involving minors aged 16 and 17, the age difference between the spouses is usually around 15 years, ‚Äúand this means a very large inequality of power.‚Äù  Although there were still over 12,500 legal child marriages last year in Brazil, the number of such unions has fallen by 30% since 2019 when Congress reformed the Civil Code to ban marriage before the age of 16 altogether, thus closing a loophole that ultimately allowed an adult who had raped a minor to marry her instead of going to jail, while also denying her access to abortion care, which she is entitled to by law. Any sexual relationship with someone aged under 16, consensual or not, is a crime in Brazil and no child aged under 16 can marry, regardless of whether his or her family has blessed it or not. Lima says this is a step in the right direction, but Plan International is still fighting to make marriage before the age of 18 illegal.  Following the controversy over the marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office opened an investigation into the Arauc√°ria mayor‚Äôs wedding and accusations of nepotism. However, as his wife is a minor, the details of the case cannot be made public.

Selecting the wedding dress was a particularly fun part of the process for Kamila, who, throughout her career as a model, has worn many. ‚ÄúI went to Galia Lahav for the first time and picked three different dresses,‚Äù she admits. ‚ÄúA week later, I went back and chose a completely different one.

Aric Hutchinson and at least 100 mourners gathered on Saturday at Folly Beach ‚Äî the same beach where he and Samantha Miller, 34, married just hours before the deadly crash ‚Äî for a memorial in honor of his late wife, CBS affiliate WCSC of Charleston reported.  Hutchinson, who sat in a wheelchair on the shoreline at the memorial, told the local station he‚Äôs ‚Äúfeeling pretty good‚Äù as he recovers from his injuries. He suffered a brain injury and broken bones as a result of crash, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his mother to help cover the cost of medical fees and the burial for Miller.  ‚ÄúMy body‚Äôs getting back to where I can manage, I guess,‚Äù Hutchinson told WCSC at the memorial. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just as good as I can feel with the situation, but obviously, today and the outpouring of people was just amazing.

Family of Samantha Miller / AP  He and Miller had been leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart when the crash unfolded on April 28, The Associated Press reported.  A woman identified by police as Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, was accused of slamming into the back of the golf cart while allegedly driving while drunk and over twice the speed limit, according to an incident report.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm after the crash, according to online records, which show that she remains in police custody.  Two other people in the golf cart besides the groom were also injured, Andrew Gilreath, Folly Beach public safety department director told the AP. He added that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Komoroski was not physically injured in the crash, according to a news release from city officials.  A witness reported that Komoroski ‚Äúwas dazed and confused‚Äù at the scene and repeatedly said ‚ÄúI did nothing wrong‚Äù and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  That report also states that Komoroski told a sergeant on the scene that she had two drinks that night: a beer and a ‚Äútequila pineapple an hour ago or so.‚Äù  Samantha Miller's mother, Lisa Miller, told Fox News Digital that Komoroski ""chose to drink, get behind the wheel, and plow down my daughter.""

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:02:07","Just in time for the summer wedding season, Dia & Co is turning its attention to dressing brides, bridesmaids and their families and friends.  Dia & Co, which offers personal styling services and plus-size apparel, now has an online landing page called the Wedding Suite. The page, which went live last week, features 38 collections curated by Dia & Co stylists. These include ‚Äúbride,‚Äù ‚Äúwedding guest,‚Äù ‚Äúmother of the bride and groom‚Äù and ‚Äúbeach wedding.‚Äù In total, the Wedding Suite contains 2,200 styles from 64 brands, including Carolina Herrera, Diane von Furstenberg, Ever-Pretty and Eloquii.  In addition to the newly-curated collections, Dia & Co launched a Wedding Styling Service for brides, bridesmaids, mothers of the bride and wedding guests. The service is free, and customers can go online to receive advice and feedback about styles and sizing. While it‚Äôs still early, the reaction to the styling service has been positive, the brand says. Dia & Co sells dresses directly via its website but also recommends certain vetted salons for those who want to design their gowns in person.  In general, the apparel market still has a long ways to go in terms of inclusion. It‚Äôs not uncommon for major retailers to start offering plus sizes, only to reduce or even eliminate offerings a couple of years later, citing cost issues or problems with demand. And while it‚Äôs true that several brands do sell plus-size wedding dresses ‚Äî David‚Äôs Bridal and Anthropologie, for example ‚Äî many of today‚Äôs dresses do not come in a variety of styles and silhouettes, which makes the process of finding the perfect dress even harder. In addition, as The Cut writes, bridal stores want to stock as many styles as possible, so they typically carry ‚Äúas few samples as possible‚Äù for people to try on.  Nadia Boujarwah, who co-founded Dia & Co in 2015, told Modern Retail she wanted to launch the Wedding Suite after getting married 10 months ago. Finding a dress was extremely complicated, she said, as many of the boutiques she visited had few options in stock. One boutique in New York City told her she could only try on four dresses, while another asked her to just hold a dress up to her body and ‚Äúsee‚Äù if it would fit.  ‚ÄúThe traditional bridal salon experience can really be very painful. For the most part, these are dresses that are made to fit very, very few women,‚Äù Boujarwah explained. ‚ÄúIt was truly unbelievable to me how challenging it was‚Ä¶ I got through my experience with a thick skin and a lot of help, but really came away from it feeling like there‚Äôs just so much better that we could be doing here. This is one of the last frontiers of inclusive fashion.‚Äù  The U.S. bridal wear market is a major industry, estimated to be worth $27 billion. Roughly 2.6 million couples got married in 2022, more than any year since 1984, the Wedding Report found.  Before launching the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co had a ‚Äúpretty extensive‚Äù offering of wedding wear, Boujarwah said. However, it did not have true bride or bridesmaid collections, and everything was self-service. With the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co wanted ‚Äúto really build out that offering of the true wedding bridal wardrobe for both our brides and an inclusive bridal party,‚Äù Boujarwah said.  For instance, while Dia & Co normally offers sizes 10 to 32, the bridesmaids‚Äô dresses now go from sizes 0 to 40. All of Dia & Co‚Äôs Wedding Suite items come in a variety of styles, as well, with silhouettes as varied as A-line, flare, midi and floor length.  That plethora of options is crucial, Shafonne Myers, editor-in-chief of the plus-size bridal magazine Pretty Pear Bride, told Modern Retail. ‚ÄúSo often you see style guides and selections based off of straight sizes, so to see inspiration that looks like us, it‚Äôs so refreshing and inspirational,‚Äù she said.  Gabriella Santaniello, founder of A Line Partners, explained that wedding dresses are typically sized smaller than everyday clothes, so a woman who is normally a size four in a regular dress would probably be a six or an eight in a wedding dress. However, very few salons have plus-sized samples on the rack, she explained, which throws the sizing difference off even more.  ‚ÄúA lot of these‚Ä¶ brands say that they‚Äôre inclusive, but when you go to try on, there‚Äôs really nothing in your size,‚Äù Santaniello said. ‚ÄúSo you end up squeezing yourself into a dress, if you can even do it‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just not a fun experience.‚Äù  Santaniello said she‚Äôs sure there‚Äôs ‚Äúa cost involved‚Äù to produce plus-sized samples. ‚ÄúBut also what would be the incremental business you‚Äôd get from it?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúProbably a lot, if a woman could come in and feel that she had a reasonable idea as to what she‚Äôd look like in the dress.‚Äù  Myers, a wedding and events planner, said there are more options now for plus-size brides than when she got married 19 years ago, But, she added, ‚Äúnot enough brands cater to the market.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn my opinion, it‚Äôs because we as a plus-size audience don‚Äôt demand it enough,‚Äù she said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I would love to see more of the plus-size demographic speaking up about what they want. The louder we can get as a community and demographic, the more of an impact we can have.‚Äù","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb2Rlcm5yZXRhaWwuY28vb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWxhc3QtZnJvbnRpZXJzLW9mLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1mYXNoaW9uLXdoeS1kaWEtY28taXMtbGF1bmNoaW5nLWEtcGx1cy1zaXplLXdlZGRpbmctc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Just as the early bird catches the worm, the DIY wedding couple saves more money for honeymoon pi√±a coladas. So to help you soon-to-be-newlyweds, today we‚Äôre talking about the decoration ideas that leave you inspired to take on a project or two that could save you cash. Have you secretly dreamed of being a florist? Here‚Äôs your chance to show off your petal-arranging chops. Still have the handwriting of a fourth grader? Eh, maybe book a calligrapher. So that you know what‚Äôs even possible, we‚Äôve rounded up 39 DIY wedding decorations ideas from industry insiders across the country.  But before we dive in, here are some general tips about decorating a wedding like a pro‚Ä¶  Is it cheaper to do your own wedding decor?  When it comes to wedding decor, one of the biggest expenses is flowers. If you‚Äôre able (and willing) to tackle those, savings can be substantial‚Äîpotentially thousands of dollars. Joan Wyndrum O‚ÄôHear, founder and owner of Blooms By The Box in Watchung, New Jersey, suggests ordering wholesale flowers and inviting family and friends (like your wedding party) to help make bouquets and boutonnieres. ‚ÄúCreate small affordable bouquets with big blooms such as hydrangeas, peonies, or football mums paired with lush greenery,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need fewer stems when you use bigger flowers. Also, go with leafy greenery for the boutonnieres.‚Äù  How can I decorate my wedding on my own?  Beyond a glue gun (though you‚Äôll definitely need one of those too), high-tech DIY tools make it easier than ever to decorate your wedding. Investing in a single device, such as a cutting machine like the Silhouette Cameo, for example, can make it possible to craft a slew of different DIY projects. Custom cake toppers, T-shirts for your bridesmaids, wedding signs, and programs can all be made with the same machine.  Additionally, taking a class to learn a new DIY skill might make your wedding projects, dare we say, fun. Sign up for a flower-arranging class, a candle-making workshop, a paper crafting lesson, or a calligraphy tutorial.  How can I make a cheap wedding look expensive?  Your venue will play a major role in your wedding style. And if you choose a place with built-in decor or eye-catching surroundings, you can achieve an expensive look without spending a fortune to dress up a blank-slate banquet hall. Jacqueline Vizcaino, owner of Atlanta-based Tinted Events Design and Planning, recommends opting for an outdoor wedding. ‚ÄúExplore natural venues instead of traditional halls,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLook for places like open-air gardens or outdoor parks where you won‚Äôt have to rely on electricity as much. This will reduce your carbon footprint and create a gorgeous backdrop for all your photos.‚Äù  What are the best decorations to use for a wedding?  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always great when you choose decor that can do double duty or, even better, triple duty,‚Äù says Jamie Chang, owner and destination wedding planner at Mango Muse Events in San Francisco. ‚ÄúFor example, a small plant or bud vase can be decor, a favor, and a place card,‚Äù she says.

Wedding rings are a symbol of love and commitment, and they come in different shapes, sizes, metals, and styles. Here are some things to consider when shopping for your wedding ring.  1. What is your ring size?  Before you start looking for a wedding ring, you need to know your ring size. You can measure your finger at home using a piece of string or paper, or you can use a ring sizer tool that you can order online or get from a jeweler. You should measure your finger in two or three places depending on the size, and compare the measurements with a chart to find your ring size. You should also take into account the width and shape of the ring, as they can affect how it fits on your finger.  2. What shape do you prefer?

She's now being called ""an almond mom,"" a term popularized on TikTok to describe adults with restrictive eating habits, and her ceremony, ""an almond wedding.""  Advertisement  The comments were ""low, hurtful, and harmful,"" the influencer said  Roughly nine years ago, the Toronto resident quit her corporate job to become a creator. She began documenting her journey to ""rebuild"" her heath in the face of several issues that arose in her twenties, including chronic bloating and adult acne.  She also endured a serious fall from a pilates class.  ""I was bedridden for about three months and really dove into trying to heal my gut and my brain at the same time,"" she said.  Nevertheless, as the video blew up over the weekend, it resulted in a spew of what Cutler called ""bullying and harassment.""  Many top commenters argued that a wedding marks a prime opportunity for indulgence and that Cutler was depriving her guests. Some went as far to say that she would be a terrible mother.  Advertisement  ""LMFAO i cannot imagine having an eating disorder themed wedding,"" reads one of the video's top comments, with 20,000 upvotes.  Cutler responded to this jab in a separate video, saying it was ""extremely low, hurtful, and harmful"" to label or diagnose someone who could possibly have mental health or body image issues.  ""If somebody is actually suffering, I think that that makes them feel more isolated,"" she told Insider.  Cutler said she didn't force guests to adhere to her diet  If anything, Cutler's intention was to inspire people with food intolerances to incorporate healthy habits when celebrating special occasions, she said.  ""I've never actually had anyone comment or attack me for eating disorders or promoting that in any way, shape, or form until this video,"" she said. Cutler added she has never been diagnosed with any type of eating disorder.  Advertisement  The creator believes some of the furor boils down to the mistaken notion that she forced her guests to hew to her diet. But guests had choices and ate standard fare, and many said it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, she said.  ""There was regular bread, we had multiple entree options that everyone was allowed to choose from at their table,"" she said. ""We had a lavish, top-shelf open bar.""  The bloat pills were optional too ‚Äî stemming from a sponsorship with supplement brand Arrae, a longtime partner. (""Weddings are a really expensive time,"" Cutler said. ""If there's something you love and you can limit cost in any way, I think all the power to it."")  At the end of the day, Cutler stands by the video and says she's confident in knowing what works best for her body.  ""I'm not going to eat gluten and feel sick because it will make someone else comfortable,"" she said. ""I think the real conversation here is around removing food-shaming from social platforms ‚Ä¶ Everyone should be making the choices that work for them.""","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
