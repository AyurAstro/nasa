Matrimony is India’s fourth largest industry, with about 10 million weddings taking place every year.  It is projected that during the peak month for weddings last year, 3.2 million ceremonies were conducted. That one month would have generated a stunning US$45 billion in revenue for the wedding industry.  This comes as a third of the country’s population is between 20 and 39 years old, an age range where most Indians get married.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoYW5uZWxuZXdzYXNpYS5jb20vYXNpYS93ZWRkaW5ncy1iaWctYnVzaW5lc3MtaW5kaWEtY2FzaC1hc3BpcmF0aW9ucy15b3VuZy1jb3VwbGVzLTM0OTc2MjbSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

This bride-to-be learnt about a devastating secret that her fiancé and her sister had been keeping from her just a few weeks before her wedding day.  A 28-year-old woman, who is engaged to her 36-year-old fiancé (D), took to Reddit to share the secret that has in fact caused her to break off the wedding. “After a family dinner this weekend, my sister, K who's 32 years old, suggested the two of us go out for some dessert alone. It was a strange suggestion for her to make as we were never really close, but I agreed. However, she simply drove us to a nearby park, where she dropped the bombshell on me that she and D went out for a while,” shares the bride-to-be. She does, however, add that this had happened before she ever met her fiancé .  “They went on dates for about a month but it fizzled out, and she repeatedly reassured me that nothing happened between her and D for the two years D and I were together. “Also, according to her, after I introduced D to my entire family (about three months into our relationship), she had a discussion with D, hoping D would break it off with me himself. However, D convinced her to simply hide it, as he was happy with me and their short fling shouldn’t interfere with our relationship,” she adds. The bride-to-be shared that she felt disgusted and betrayed.  “My sister is very non-confrontational and I can understand why she wouldn’t want to be the one to tell me, but I’ve been with D for over two years, and lived with him for almost a whole year. “When we got home, I blew up at him in front of our families, for having kept such a large secret from me and broke off the wedding. He’s tried to explain that his fling with my sister meant nothing, but I still believed he should have told me, and this has made me doubt if he has any other secrets he’s been keeping from me,” the Reddit user continues. “Since then, he, along with his mother and sister, have been persistently bombarding me with calls and texts. They wanted me to go on with the wedding, telling me that D has proved again and again how much he loved me, that the arrangements have all been made and we can’t get our deposits back, and that I would be letting down our wedding guests.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pb2wuY28uemEvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2xvdmUtc2V4L3JlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHMvYnJpZGUtdG8tYmUtY2FsbHMtb2ZmLXdlZGRpbmctYWZ0ZXItZmluZGluZy1vdXQtdGhhdC1oZXItc2lzdGVyLWFuZC1oZXItZmlhbmNlLWhhZC1hLWZsaW5nLThjMmM0ODYzLThjYTctNGIwOS05YjU3LTNkZmY2NTExNGNmMdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The anonymous woman shared her bizarre post-wedding woes on social media detailing how her husband’s mother also threw away the boxes the presents came in and had re-arranged the kitchen while she was house-sitting.  The new wife revealed her spouse's mum called to ask if she help around the home in any way while the pair were on their romantic getaway in Italy. But after being told that all she needed to do was swap some bowls and put out their new toaster, the mum ""completely overstepped"" and took it upon herself to open all of the couple's wedding presents. And to make matters worse, the woman's mother-in-law also re-organised the entire kitchen, which has left the woman feeling ""overwhelmed"" as she now can't find anything - and some of her sentimental items have been thrown away.  The anonymous woman shared her story on Reddit  In a post on Reddit, the woman vented: ""My mother-in-law tried to 'help' and completely overstepped. She and my father-in-law opened every single wedding present my husband and I received, threw every box away, and proceeded to re-organise the entire kitchen. I feel so violated while also feeling so overwhelmed by the task of trying to get things back to how they were. ""She called the day after our wedding while we were leaving the house for an overnight flight to Italy and asked how she could help. We said one task we have been avoiding is swapping out all the old plates and bowls for new plates and bowls, and maybe swapping out the old toaster for the new toaster. (I just wanted them to swap the upgrades). ""She opened every single wedding present and basically threw away every single box in the entire house. I can't return a single thing. (If I CAN return it, I'll have to purchase a vessel to transport the item in). She re-organised my whole kitchen and now I can't find anything.

Now I don't even want to be in my kitchen. I can't find anything and the process of looking usually leads to finding out they moved or threw away something important to me."" The woman added that she now feels ""depressed"" whenever she looks at her kitchen and feels stressed at the thought of having to write thank you cards for presents she didn't even get to open herself. Commenters on the post were sympathetic toward the woman, with many urging her to cut all contact with her mother-in-law if she refuses to apologise for overstepping. One person said: ""This is so heartbreaking! They absolutely need to apologise - genuinely. They need to feel remorse for what they did. Even then it won't be good enough. It just won't. Change the locks. Don't let them come over for a long, long time."" While another added: ""I would NEVER speak with her again or let her in our house. This was your house, your stuff, your space.

It is almost exactly five years since they tied the knot in a fairytale wedding at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Since then, their lives have taken a very different path from what would have been expected - with the couple quitting royal life for California while Harry is barely on speaking terms with his older brother Prince William.  It was on the wedding day on May 19, 2018, that William stood by his brother's side as he welcomed bride Meghan down the aisle before saying 'I do'.

In his memoir Spare, Harry recalls having drinks with friends at Coworth Park Hotel, where he stayed the night before his big day at Windsor Castle.  He claimed William, who had just become a dad for the third time, had been due to join them but he cancelled at the ""last minute"" citing ""Kate and the kids"".  Image: AFP/Getty Images) AFP/Getty Images)  He then goes on to say that he reminded William that it was their tradition as the night before the now Prince of Wales's wedding, the pair had dinner together ahead of greeting the crowds.  Harry claims William asked: ""Why are you even saying hello to the crowds, Harold?""  To which Harry in response admitted in the book: ""I felt sick about it.""  Image: AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images)  However, Harry did concede that William eventually changed his mind about greeting the crowds and did agree to join his brother, as the Duke of Sussex wondered: ""Maybe Granny intervened"".  Harry says he pressed William about having dinner together and staying the night - and eventually, he relented and agreed to dinner, but wouldn't be staying over, reportedly telling his brother ""Sorry, Harold. Can't. Kids.""  It's unknown how Harry and Meghan will exactly be celebrating their fifth wedding anniversary tomorrow.  The traditional gift to give for five years of marriage is wood, so it's a possibility that the couple will exchange gifts made from the material on Friday.  It is also likely they will be marking the day privately, probably with their children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.  Prince Harry's memoir Spare became the fastest-selling non-fiction book ever when his tell-all tale criticising the royal family was finally published earlier this year.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFscy9wcmluY2UtaGFycnktZmVsdC1zaWNrLXByaW5jZS0zMDAxNDk4MNIBT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pcnJvci5jby51ay9uZXdzL3JveWFscy9wcmluY2UtaGFycnktZmVsdC1zaWNrLXByaW5jZS0zMDAxNDk4MC5hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Teresa Giudice‘s husband, Luis “Louie” Ruelas, opened up about why he decided to talk to her ex-husband, Joe Giudice, on their wedding day — and revealed what the pair discussed.  “I called him, basically just let him know that everything’s gonna be OK — that we’re a team,” the entrepreneur, 49, exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. “It felt right to call him and talk to him, because he’s a good father. He definitely makes lemonade outta lemons, and it’s something that people don’t see out there. And I just wanted to acknowledge that for him.”  Teresa and Joe, both 50, called it quits in 2019 after 20 years of marriage and finalized their divorce one year later. The former couple, who tied the knot in 1999, share four daughters: Gia, 22, Gabriella, 19, Milania, 17, and Audriana, 13.  Louie explained that he wanted to reach out to Joe to let him know he planned to be “all hands on deck” with the girls. The businessman has a similar relationship with his ex-wife, Marisa Dimartino Ruelas, with whom he shares sons Nicholas and Louie Jr. Last year, Marisa joined her ex-husband and Teresa in Atlantic City to celebrate Louie Jr.’s birthday.  “We spent the weekend together, we went out for some dinner, and it was so nice,” the Real Housewives of New Jersey star recalls to Us. “It was a fun night. It was really nice.”  The Dancing With the Stars alum adds that she and her husband plan to visit Joe in the Bahamas again soon after previously having dinner with him and the kids. That get-together, she notes, was Louie’s idea.  “I’m so happy we did [it],” Teresa says of the rendezvous. “It made my daughter so happy. And I was like, ‘Thank you so much for doing that.’ It wasn’t my idea, it was his. So [Louie] gets to take the credit for it. But then after I did it, I’m like, ‘Thank you,’ because they really made the girls so happy.”  The Turning the Tables author and Louie tied the knot in August 2022 after getting engaged one year prior. A special documenting their wedding, Teresa Gets Married, is set to air on Bravo Tuesday, May 23.  “It was kind of like a fairy tale,” Teresa tells Us of the big day. “It was the wedding I’ve always wanted.

Or so said the company’s chief Ciaran Davis at the company’s annual general meeting on Wednesday.  The statement rules out attendance by company chairman (and Sandilands’ ultimate boss) Hamish McLennan, who between his chairmanship of Rugby Australia, REA Group and Magellan is no slouch on the social scene. Guess King Kyle, whose hit show with Jackie ‘O’ Henderson is the network’s golden goose, is way past managing up.  No radio bosses were allowed at Kyle Sandilands and Tegan Kynaston’s wedding. Jack Henry/Instagram  No company funds were used on the wedding, Davis added, though the content it generated was widely used on its own programs. Asked how the company felt about its star getting married alongside convicted drug smuggler Simon Main (Sandilands’ best man), McLennan himself took the mic to describe the wedding as a “private matter”.  Though he couldn’t do anything but admit it was nonetheless “very well publicised”.

Georgina Mitchell, 33, claims that the ""negative and unfair"" word - meaning a woman to be wed who becomes unpleasant to deal with - is being phased out.  Instead, the term is being replaced by ""main character bride"" - a much more positive figure, Georgina says. The wedding planner, who has been in the business for 12 years and got married herself last year, added: ""It's like that nightmare employee has become the boss and all is well.  ""Bridezilla is such a negative and unfair term. It was basically about brides crying out to be heard because it's their special day. But they were so disempowered by other people paying - like gifts with strings attached.  ""If we go right back then women were moving families - the passive bride who was given away. That evolved into bridezilla, it was her big day but she didn't own it.  ""Now brides are the main character. They pay for the wedding and can have what they want without a fight. I call her the main character bride. She’s basically, 'This is what we’re doing - come if you want. She's only answerable to her partner.""  Georgina gives daily tips on Instagram and TikTok and hosts a wedding-themed podcast. She says the cost of a big day has risen in recent years, with the price of a photographer more than doubling - as people want social media ready content.  But modern weddings are generally smaller and more often held outside, she added. There has also a shift away from the groom's side and the bride's side as modern families are structured differently, Georgina said.  Brides are also opting for two dresses now - the long train in the day then often changing into a short, party dress for the evening. And food is no longer a sitdown, served meal, but more likely street food vans, and pie and mash is a popular option, she said.  ""Weddings are a lot more informal now,"" she went on. ""Couples just want their friends and families to come along and have a good time. Social media has generated a lot of the change I think.  ""Now people use it to get ideas, and they realise they're not alone when they want to go for a non-traditional option. The cost of photographers is eye-watering now. I'd say around £2,000 on average.  ""The biggest change is that couples are doing it their way because they don't feel beholden to anyone else. They can pay for it themselves so they can do what they like.  ""I’ve known a couple to be given £20,000 for their wedding but it came with so many stipulations that they gave it back. They were told who to invite, what kind of wedding to have, what the colour scheme would be.  Georgina and husband Brian, 33, a personal finance influencer, had their legal wedding at a registry office two weeks before another ceremony and party on New Year's Eve. Her dress was fitted with a long train, and there was no cake - instead guests got to make their own cocktails.  Georgina worked on weddings in her roles at a golf club, a hotel, and with an outdoor catering company before setting up her own business, Georgina Rose Events in Gloucester in 2020.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vdHRpbmdoYW1wb3N0LmNvbS9uZXdzL3VrLXdvcmxkLW5ld3Mvd2VkZGluZy1leHBlcnQtc2F5cy10ZXJtLWJyaWRlemlsbGEtODQ0OTI5M9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Her simplicity, her innocence, and her beauty managed to get her a lot of fans. The actress may be away from the limelight for several years now but that has not affected her fan following at all. She is now happily married to RJ Anmol, and they are proud parents of a baby boy. Well, in an interview with a news portal, the actress opened up about her wedding arrangements and moreover her wedding outfit. Scroll down to read it.  Amrita Rao opens up about her wedding outfit  Amrita Rao and RJ Anmol kept their wedding quite low-key as compared to grand Bollywood weddings that we have been seeing in the near past. These two tied the knot at Iskcon temple in Katraj, Pune. In the book that the couple released, they mentioned every detail of their wedding. It is mentioned that they spent only Rs 1.50 lakh in total at their wedding including the venue cost, wedding dresses, travel, and other costs. In fact, the most surprising thing was that the actress only spent Rs 3000 on her wedding attire. In the book she mentioned that she was very clear and had also mentioned to her husband before their wedding that she wants to keep it really simple and not opt for any designer wear for her big day. She chose to wear simple traditional attire that cost her only Rs 3000. In fact, the wedding venue also charged them only Rs 11,000.  Amrita Rao was flooded with marriage proposals  In a recent interview with Rajshri Productions, Amrita Rao recalled the time after Vivaah was released. Amrita Rao revealed that she would get several proposals. She further added that at that time they did not have so many smartphones so she would mostly get those letters from guys in Canada and the US, and they used to send her photos of their house, their moms, and their cars. Earlier, Amrita Rao had also said how her husband had seen Vivaah with his mother and his mother asked him to get a daughter-in-law like Poonam.

The social media star proposed to his girlfriend in 2021, after nearly ten years together.  The couple are set to tie the knot in Killarney later this month.  Speaking to Evoke ahead of their wedding, Tadhg gushed: “Alannah is the opposite to a bridezilla, she’s very easy going and said ‘whatever you like, go for it,’ so I’ve picked the flowers and the band. She went ‘that’s grand’ and there’s been no stress and no panic.”  “It was gas actually, the girl who’s doing the flowers said to me ‘it’s normally the bride and not the groom calling in’ but this has worked perfectly for us.”  “There’s only a couple of weeks to go now but I’d say it’s butterflies more than nerves.”  “It’s exciting but a little stressful at the same time because the list is never ending. But there’s no need to stress, you know who’s coming.”  “The dogs are a massive part of our life – we’ve just got a new puppy two weeks before the wedding,” Tadhg continued.  “And Otis helped me propose, he had on a little tux and the engagement ring was in a box on him, he was my wing man, so they’ll be a big part of the day.”  “The priest told us to make sure the day was about us as well and not all about the dogs but it wouldn’t be our wedding without them.”  Tadhg gushed about his relationship with Alannah in an exclusive interview with Goss.ie last year.  The Kerry native said at the time: “Lockdown definitely made us stronger, we didn’t kill each other! She’s definitely one of my best friends and she’s also my biggest critic. If I have any videos she doesn’t like, she’ll tell me straight, there’s no s**t.”  “She’s brilliant. With anything I do, she pushes me forward. She does her own thing, I do mine, and then we rendez-vous on the couch with a takeaway and talk about what happened in each other’s day.”  “We’re really excited to finally get married. It’s going to be really special.

Customer orders have been plunged into chaos since the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.  Despite the firm's initial promise that it would find an 'alternative platform' for registries, families say they are none the wiser about what is happening with their gifts.  It means many can no longer access their wishlist - and some have even lost money due to the glitch.  Mom-to-be Jessica Ferrara is celebrating her baby shower on Saturday and guests are now unable to view her registry data.  Even if they could view it, every item is out of stock or discontinued.  On top of that, Ferrara and her partner lost $1,000 on purchases they made themselves such as a crib that converts into a toddler bed and items needed to turn a dresser into a changing table.  Before the purchases arrived, the site said they were out of stock. Customer service has yet to offer her a refund.  The 36-year-old told the Philadelphia Inquirer: 'Your third trimester you’re supposed to be enjoying it and nesting.  'There certainly hasn’t been any nesting going on.'  Similarly, bride-to-be CC Manstrom said she has watched the majority of the 30 items on her registry become unavailable.  She is now worried that several people will buy her the same limited gifts which are available.  The retailer has also stopped honoring credits - meaning Manstrom lost out on the $60 that had been put into her account for gifts which were purchased but not available.  She hasn't been able to speak to a customer service representative on the phone.  'It is frustrating. It’s a new task you have to deal with on the wedding checklist,' Manstrom told the New York Times.  Meanwhile, Amy Tamayo wrote on TikTok: 'When you find out that none of your wedding registry orders were fulfilled & BBB gave you store credit without telling you.'  After initially announcing the bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond said it would partner with another platform where couples could transfer their existing data.  It said it would share the information 'within days.'  But more than two weeks on, no announcement has been made.  Mom-to-be Jessica Ferrara, pictured, is celebrating her baby shower on Saturday and guests are now unable to view her registry  Customer orders have been plunged into chaos since the retail giant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April  A note on the retailer's website still reads: 'Customers’ registry data is important to us.

In the meantime, several companies are attempting to swoop in on frustrated customers.  Etsy claims thousands of shoppers have signed up to its wedding registry after launching the new service on May 10.  And Zola, an online registry, told the New York Times it had received 'several hundred emails' from couples asking to transfer their Bed Bath & beyond registries.

"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","{""Brits"", ""NorthWest"", ""SouthAfrica""}","Thu 18 May 2023 15:07:00","There are lots of different thoughts and opinions on wedding planning etiquette (Picture: Getty)  Weddings are a wonderful celebration of love but they can also cause more than their fair share of drama - especially when there's tricky social dynamics or finances to navigate.  Our advice to brides and grooms-to-be? Offer plus ones if you can.  Almost half (49%) of Brits said they would be bothered if they didn't get a plus one to a wedding, according to a survey of more than 2,000 Brits by wedding supplier Ginger Ray, shared exclusively with Metro.co.uk.  In fact, people feel so passionately about this issue that 10% would go as far as decline an invite altogether if they didn't get a plus one.  High costs of weddings can also divide the crowds. A third of wedding guests (34%) think those tying the knot should pay for guest accommodation. And interestingly, those who earn more expect more.  Nearly half of Brits with a salary of £55,000 per year or more said they would be bothered if their accommodation wasn't paid for, compared to just 31% of those who earn £15,000 or less a year.  You'll also want to keep the purse strings of bridesmaids and groomsmen in mind, as 63% of Brits said it was acceptable to decline an invitation to be in the wedding party because of the costs and responsibilities associated with it.  One in six Brits would skip a wedding altogether to save money (Picture: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  But on the plus side, only a third of people believe the couple should cover every cost for the wedding party and over half (54%) said they shouldn’t pay - so if you need to ask your bridesmaid's to pay for their dresses, it won't come as a surprise to most.  Separate research by jeweller F. Hinds backed up that money is a real sticking point for guests.  Around third of the 2,000 surveyed said they would skip part of a wedding to save money. One in five would skip the reception and just attend the ceremony while 16% would skip the nuptials and head for the party.  With Brits spending an average of £604 to attend each wedding, one in six Brits claimed they would decline the invite altogether in a bid to save some cash.  Then you've got the cost of destination weddings which, while they look great on the Instagram, can burn a hole in your pocket.  Top ways guests would choose to save money attending a wedding: Wearing something they already own to save on a new outfit - 42% Not attending the hen or stag do - 25% Spending less on a wedding gift for the couple - 23% Booking cheap accommodation - 22% Driving to the venue to avoid getting a taxi - 20% Only attending the wedding ceremony - 18% Declining the wedding invitation - 17% Only attending the wedding reception - 16% Sharing travel or accommodation with other guests - 15% Not drinking at the reception - 12%  When it comes to children-free weddings, things can sometimes get pretty heated between the future married couple and guests who have young kids.  But interestingly, the Ginger Ray survey found over half of Brits said they wouldn't be bothered if their kids weren't invited to the wedding and only 9% wouldn't attend as a result. Maybe it would be a welcome break to have a little adult time.  About 16% of Brits would skip the wedding ceremony and attend the reception (Picture: Getty Images)  How to avoid these wedding mishaps  Ginger Ray's wedding planning expert Jess Martin shared her advice for navigating some common, tricky situations during wedding season.    Declining an invite due to finances  'The way you go about it is what really matters, and if someone loves you enough to have invited you to be in their wedding, then they will completely understand the reasons why you can’t accept.  Budgeting as a guest/bridesmaid/groomsman  'Questions like: ""I’m trying to budget for your big day, can you let me know what things I will need to pay for myself so I can plan for it?"" or ""So I know how much to budget for, can you let me know what you will be paying for and what I’ll need to pay for myself?""  'This shows the couple you’re aware there will be additional costs, but leaves the onus on them to explain what costs you might incur as part of the wedding party.  Telling guests they DO NOT have a plus one  'The best way to avoid this question is to make it really clear on your wedding invitations who the invite is for, specifically.  'I’d go so far as to write on the invitations something like: ""no additional guest invited"" or ""no +1 allowed"" or ""this invite is for Jane and Jane only"" to just make your point totally clear!  'Whether you don’t want a plus one from a financial perspective, from a capacity point of view, or because you simply do not want people you don’t know at your wedding, it’s your wedding and your rules!'  'If it bothers your guests so much that they cannot bring another person to the wedding of one of their friends, then perhaps they shouldn’t come at all.'  At the end of the day it's your wedding and your rules (within reason) (Picture: Getty Images)  Making sure there's no surprise little guests  'The best way to make the point clear, is again to make sure it’s written in the invitations. Including the message ""this wedding is for adults only"" or ""please note: children are not invited on this occasion"" are simple disclaimers that get the point across in a clear and concise way.  'If after that you still are asked the question, all you need to do is respond with: ""as mentioned in the invitations, we have decided to make our wedding day an adults-only event, and there will not be any facilities or catering options for children. We’re really sorry if this means you can’t make the wedding, but we totally understand!""'  Telling family they'll have to pay for their own accomodation  'Most people won’t expect you to pay for accommodation as just a guest. However, clarity is key when it comes to family members and those in the wedding party.  'Let them know as soon as possible whether they will need to find and book their own place to stay.  'In your wedding invitations or save the dates, it can be nice to include a list of suggested accommodation options. It also serves as a handy hint that people will need to find and book their own.  'If you are lucky enough to have some rooms available for guests to stay in at your venue, make it very clear who is staying where otherwise people may automatically presume they can stay and let people know as soon as possible.'

Upset over the Church’s indifference, the bridegroom is now slated to move a contempt of court petition in the High Court against the Knanaya Church.  The 31-year-old bridegroom, a member of St. Anne’s Church, Kottody, in Kasaragod under the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam, was slated to marry Vijimol, a member of St Xavier’s Church, Kottody, under the Thalassery archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church.  Also Read | A wedding could script history for Knanaya Catholic Church  Although he was entitled to get a consent or Vivaha Kuri from his church as per a High Court order, he was denied the same at the last minute citing the absence of an application. As the marriage sacrament could not be completed, the bridegroom and bride exchanged garlands at a brief function held outside St Xavier’s Church.  “Having completed all the stipulations for marrying a woman such as attending the pre-marriage course and making confession, there is no reason why the Church should deny me the consent,” Mr. John said. The marriage, according to him, was scheduled to be organised at the bride’s parish to avoid a possible law and order situation at his own parish.  Meanwhile, the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samiti, a reformation group that leads legal battle to end the practice of endogamy in the Knanaya Church, will also file a contempt of court case in the High Court against the denial of Vivaha Kuri to Mr. John.  The Knanaya Archeparchy, on its part, clarified that the bridegroom had failed to submit relevant documents and complete procedures for his marriage. “He approached the parish for a consent only on the eve of his wedding. We need to complete the canonical procedure before issuing the consent for the marriage,” said Fr. Michael Vettikkatt, spokesperson of the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam.  As to a query whether the membership of Mr. John with the Knanaya Archeparchy stood cancelled with the wedding, Fr. Vettikkatt replied that the court had prohibited termination of membership of a member for marrying from outside the sect.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinQFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdS5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb25hbC9rZXJhbGEvd2VkZGluZy10dXJucy1hLWRhbXAtc3F1aWItYnJpZGVncm9vbS10by1tb3ZlLWNvbnRlbXB0LXBsZWEtYWdhaW5zdC1rbmFuYXlhLWNhdGhvbGljLWNodXJjaC9hcnRpY2xlNjY4NjcwODMuZWNl0gGiAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS93ZWRkaW5nLXR1cm5zLWEtZGFtcC1zcXVpYi1icmlkZWdyb29tLXRvLW1vdmUtY29udGVtcHQtcGxlYS1hZ2FpbnN0LWtuYW5heWEtY2F0aG9saWMtY2h1cmNoL2FydGljbGU2Njg2NzA4My5lY2UvYW1wLw?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-09-01","19:00:00","{""Bundaberg"", ""Queensland"", ""Australia""}","Fri 19 May 2023 03:44:00","A bride's decision not to cover the expenses of her deaf sister's Auslan sign language interpreters for the wedding reception has ignited a social media debate, raising questions surrounding bridal etiquette and shedding light on the broader, significant issues faced by the Deaf community.  The predicament was explained in a post originally shared on Facebook, which later sparked discussion on the social media site Reddit.  ""Looking for advice here. I have my half sister's wedding in September this year. My whole family are hearing, I'm the only one Deaf and use Auslan,"" the original post explained.  A bride's refusal to cover the cost of her Deaf sister's interpreter's meals at the wedding reception has ignited a debate. Image: Getty Creative  ""My sister is refusing to pay and accomodate for 2 Auslan interpreters to be at the wedding reception. I will be paying the Auslan interpreters with my NDIS funding of course but should I be out of pocket for their meals?""  'Feeding them is the least she could do'  Members of a popular Reddit community dedicated to exposing shameful wedding planning practices wasted no time in weighing in on the subject.  ""I would skip the wedding if they are not willing to provide meals to the interpreters,"" voiced one individual, while another emphasised the importance of considering the deaf sister's needs. ""This person invited someone who is Deaf. It's not like the sister doesn't know she needs an interpreter to be comfortable at the wedding. Feeding them is the least she could do. She should have planned her wedding knowing this was going to be a cost.""  RELATED:  Echoing these sentiments, another member, who said they had Deaf family members, affirmed the importance of accommodating interpreters. ""My parents are Deaf and every wedding/funeral/formal event has had interpreting accomodations made by whoever planned the event, my parents don't even ask because it's a known need within my family.""  Story continues  Other group members concurred, with one describing the cost of two extra meals as a ""nominal cost"" and negligible in the overall context of a wedding, especially considering the financial burden the Deaf person already faces in hiring interpreters for the event.  Redditors were divided on the topic. Photo: Facebook  ""The bride should 100% be paying for their meals for them. I can't believe that is even a suggestion that she wouldn't.""  Adding to the discussion, a wedding photographer chuckled, ""you’d be amazed the lengths some couples go to in order to save $45 on their $17K wedding. It’s insane.""  On the other hand  However, not everyone thought the bride should shoulder the cost of the interpreters' meals at the wedding reception.  ""I would offer to pay for the meals of my own interpreters,"" one person told the group, ""I would expect my half-sister to accommodate my interpreters at my table, but I would gladly offer to pay for their meals.""  ""I’m actually really torn,"" said another ""I kind of side with the bride, here. She should absolutely accommodate them by welcoming them, making space for them at the table, seating chart, etc. but I definitely don’t think the bride needs to pay them for their services.""  The discussion surrounding the issue went on to raise broader questions regarding the lack of sign language knowledge within families and significant issues faced by the Deaf community.  ""I'm confused as to why she needs an interpreter,"" someone stated. ""Why hasn't her family learned sign language? Do they really expect her to go to Christmas dinner and barbecues and hanging out with aunts and uncles without being able to communicate with them?""  A group member identifying as Deaf highlighted the common occurrence of hearing families neglecting to learn sign language. ""Actually, Deaf here,"" they wrote, ""the majority of hearing families never learn sign for their deaf family member.""  Another person further explained that it is indeed quite common for parents of Deaf children to forgo learning sign language, hoping that their children will rely on lip-reading. ""If many parents won’t even bother to learn it, then it’s very possible her extended family hasn’t either.""  ""Even if her family had learned (which it sounds like they haven't),"" another person said ""will the maid of honour have learned just to accomodate her? The best man? Staff at the venue? Anyone else who might speak at the event? Probably not.""  ""To be left out of every single joke. It would be beyond isolating!""  Never miss a thing. Sign up to Yahoo Lifestyle’s daily newsletter.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Jaipur"", ""Rajasthan"", ""India""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:34:01","It is understandable why destination weddings have grown in popularity in India in recent years. They not only give the couple and their guests a special experience, but they also give people a chance to travel to new and intriguing places in the nation. But as times have changed, more and more couples are choosing destination weddings, where they can say their vows in front of beautiful settings while being joined by family and friends.  However, it’s not just about ‘destination weddings’ anymore. The latest trend to hit the marriage market is ‘Vicination Weddings’ - destination weddings held near to or in the same area as the couple’s or their families’ primary residence.  Couples are opting to say their vows at close locations instead of travelling to a distant location because they provide a special and intimate experience for everyone involved. Tourist destinations close to Tier-1 and Metro cities are becoming more popular as a result of this trend. In the north are Jaipur, Udaipur, Mussoorie, Agra, and Lonavala, while in the south are Coorg, Ooty, Mahabalipuram, and Puducherry.  Vicination weddings are gaining popularity for multiple reasons, including the ease of travel, familiarity of the place as they enjoyed a change of scene from a typical wedding. The couples and the family also get to imbibe some local feel to the D-Day.    ​​​​​​​Convenience  Vicination weddings are becoming increasingly popular in India due to the convenience factor they offer. By having the wedding in a nearby location, the couple can save on travel costs and minimise the amount of planning and coordination required. Moreover, guests who may have busy schedules or other commitments can attend the wedding without having to take too much time off work or away from their families.    Promote culture & tradition  Weddings in the vicinity offer the chance to showcase the local culture and traditions. The wedding venue and decor can incorporate local elements and traditions, giving the wedding a unique and authentic feel. Moreover, by supporting local vendors and businesses, the wedding can contribute to the local economy and community.    The difference  While vicination weddings can be a sought-after option for people not willing to go far for a wedding, there is a fair chance of missing out on some fun of a destination wedding. If the location is familiar to the guests and the couple, it may not offer the same level of novelty or adventure as a destination wedding.  For couples who wish to commemorate their special day without the added hassle and expense of travelling far away, vicination weddings are a sensible and handy choice.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Goshen"", ""Indiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 09:29:43","A 77-year-old woman from Ohio has fulfilled her lifelong dream – to marry herself.  Dorothy “Dottie” Fideli celebrated her love for herself during a wedding ceremony at her retirement home on Saturday 13 May. The mother of three and grandmother was married once in 1965, but the marriage ended after nine years. Now, after 40 years of being single, she’s finally performed the ultimate act of self love.  “This is something I’ve always wanted,” Fideli told NBC affiliate WLWT5. “I wanted to get married and have a happy life but things didn’t work out that way and now I have a second chance in doing something that’ll make me happy.”  The wedding, which took place at O’Bannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, was an emotional and symbolic ceremony surrounded by family and friends. Fideli initially got the idea to marry herself from her neighbours, who had heard about a woman doing something similar on a talk show, WLWT5 reported.  “I do some crazy things around here just to make people laugh,” she said in an interview with Today. “When I see them all down in the dumps, I go get one of my outfits on and dress up and come down, and they smile.”  But on Saturday, Fideli’s plan to uplift the residents of the retirement home turned out to be an emotional and symbolic ceremony.  For her first wedding in 1965, Fideli and her ex-husband quickly exchanged vows at a courthouse, but “he went to work and I went home” right after the ceremony. “I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,” she jokingly told Today. Fideli added that she always wished she could have had a “big wedding”, but had thought it was “too late” for her.  It’s because of her daughter, Donna Pennington, that Fideli’s dreams came true. Her daughter did all the cooking for the big day, and decorated the retirement home’s community room with balloons. Fideli wore a white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt, as well as a white veil with an embellished headband.  Story continues  “I told my daughter, I said, ‘This is the best thing that I’ve ever had, outside of having you kids,’” Fideli told Today. “‘This is what I’ve always wanted and I’m so happy that you [gave] it to me.’”  Like any bride, the 77-year-old was “nervous” leading up to the wedding but was ultimately “really happy” when she married herself. During the ceremony, which was officiated by the retirement home’s property manager, Fideli held a white lily in her hand as a symbol for self-love, according to Today.  “I said, ‘Everybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they’re happy and everything’s going to be hunky-dory, but they don’t consider the inside, the little petals inside,’” she recalled.  “‘The inside is what’s important. That’s where God’s love flows,’” Fideli continued. “‘That’s where he gives you wisdom and he gives you hope. And nobody ever takes time to think about that. So that’s what I’ve done, and I’d appreciate it if all of you people would do it and think of it that way.’”  After dedicating much of her time towards raising her family, Fideli said she’s “at the point” in my life” where it’s “my turn to do what I want to do”.  “Love, love is the most important thing in this world, and if you love God and love yourself, this world will be a field of roses,” Fideli told WLWT5, adding that she hopes her story inspires others to find their own self-love.  “If it’s not in the cards for them, then there’s something out there that will make them happy and find themselves in life and fulfil their soul.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vZWxkZXJseS13b21hbi1tYXJyaWVzLWhlcnNlbGYtYWdlLTA5Mjk0MzA1NC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9hbXBodG1sL2VsZGVybHktd29tYW4tbWFycmllcy1oZXJzZWxmLWFnZS0wOTI5NDMwNTQuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 17:56:23","A woman looking for advice on what to wear to a friend’s wedding sparked a spirited debate about what makes a dress too similar to a wedding gown.  The woman, who goes by the Reddit user name u/phonate, shared a picture of her initial look in the popular forum r/Weddingattireapproval, asking: “Floral formal for late summer/early fall wedding by the sea Suggestions welcomed??”  The picture in the post showcased a tan lace dress with a deep V neckline and ruffled skirt, its entirety adorned with multi-coloured flowers. The outfit is currently being sold by designer fashion brand Teuta Matoshi for $749.  In the caption, the Reddit user described the dress code of the wedding and the itinerary for the event.  “Colourful formal with a floral twist…interesting patterns and prints, high-hats, scarves, oversized jackets, favourite dress,” she wrote. “Wedding ceremony by the ocean, followed by dinner reception and party. The setting of the party is a micro-village with festivities shifting between our garden, adjacent the ocean and at our house.”  She noted that while she thought the lace midi-dress would be a good fit, she thought that other people in the Reddit forum may have “better ideas” for her.  As of 18 May, the post has more than 2,200 upvotes, with fellow Reddit users expressing that the outfit looks too similar to the style of a wedding gown and encouraging her to find a new one.  “It’s pretty but find it in a different colour, I’ve seen bridal gowns that look just like this,” one wrote.  “I had to check and make sure this wasn’t a bride asking for opinions on her wedding gown. Sooo, probably not a good choice,”  A third shared: “I think it’s too light. I just saw a wedding dress that looked almost identical, Teuta Matoshi has a million different colours. I think green would be nice.”  However, other people felt like it was a good fit for the occasion given its dress code.  “I love this super specific theme tbh,” one wrote. “Love this dress + matches the theme perfectly!”  Story continues  “I say WEAR IT!!! ITS FREAKING GORGEOUS,” another wrote, while a third added: “I think it works, especially because it’s tea-length and not white.”  The wedding guest later gave an update on the situation and revealed that the bride told her not to wear this gown, writing: “Checked with the bride and this dress is cancelled. Seeking recommendations for alternatives!”  It’s a general rule of thumb that guests should not wear white to someone’s wedding. With that in mind, wedding dress designer Madeline Gardner also told The Knot that there are some dress colours that guests should avoid.  “When you’re a guest at a wedding, the most important thing to keep in mind is not to upstage or upset the bride,” Gardner said. “It’s safe to stay away from any outfits that are predominantly white, cream or ivory.”  This is far from the first time a wedding guest’s outfit has sparked an etiquette debate. Earlier this week, Olivia Wilde was met with mixed reactions when she wore a backless white gown to Colton Underwood’s wedding to Jordan C Brown.  “Wore a wedding dress to a wedding just so I could make a joke about it in my toast,” Wilde captioned a since-expired photo of herself wearing the dress and holding a white parasol at the ceremony on her Instagram Stories.  Despite the criticism she faced for her look, the Don’t Worry Darling star revealed that the grooms “approved” her dress selection in a follow-up post.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vd29tYW4tc3BhcmtzLWRlYmF0ZS1tYWtlcy1kcmVzcy0xNzU2MjM4MjMuaHRtbNIBTWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vYW1waHRtbC93b21hbi1zcGFya3MtZGViYXRlLW1ha2VzLWRyZXNzLTE3NTYyMzgyMy5odG1s?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-01","19:00:00","{""Seattle"", ""Washington"", ""UnitedStates""}","Fri 19 May 2023 04:07:30","[This story contains spoilers to the season 19 two-episode finale of Grey’s Anatomy, “Wedding Bell Blues/Happily Ever After.”]  The two-hour conclusion to Grey’s Anatomy’s 19th season welcomed back two of its recently departed doctors, and left another character’s fate up in the air.  After exiting the hit ABC medical drama as a series regular earlier in the season, Ellen Pompeo made her anticipated return during the May 18 two-part finale, “Wedding Bell Blues/Happily Ever After.” The episode split its time between the veteran cast and the younger batch of interns, with the main storyline centering around Simone’s (Alexis Floy) wedding day and the young doctor ultimately calling off her nuptials and choosing Lucas (Niko Terho). With the wedding as the backdrop, love was in the air for many of the characters — including Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Link (Chris Carmack), who finally vocalized their love for one another.  And both Meredith (Pompeo) and Maggie (Kelly McCreary) — after wrapping each of their stories by choosing their own passions over love — rekindled their relationships on their own terms in their returns. When a group of the Grey Sloan Memorial doctors fly out to Boston to attend the ceremony for the coveted Catherine Fox Award (where Chandra Wilson’s Bailey, in a heartfelt moment, received a surprise award for her devotion to reproductive health care after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision), both Nick (Scott Speedman) and Winston (Anthony Hill) got the chance to reunite with their estranged partners. Meredith and Nick last spoke when she pretended to not hear his “I love you” while she boarded her plane to Boston with her children; and Maggie and husband Winston left their marriage up in the air when she moved to Chicago to pursue her medical ambitions.  Meredith and Nick cleared up a few misunderstandings, mainly that Nick should have never let Meredith walk away. “I want to live a whole life with love, and mess and pain… and you,” he told her, to which she replied, “Well, OK, then,” and they shared a kiss. Meanwhile, Winston finally matched Maggie’s ambitions and when he did, they agreed to start here and figure out the rest as they embark on a long-distance relationship.  But the episode wasn’t all about tying things up in neat bows. Meredith, who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer’s, potentially put her career in jeopardy by making public her new findings, which contradict decades of studies. Webber (James Pickens Jr.) potentially put his sobriety in jeopardy after being rocked by a near-death experience on the flight to Boston. And Teddy (Kim Raver) ends the episode unconscious and on the floor of a surgery room, her fate unclear by the episode’s end. Teddy, who was recently named Chief, spent the episode complaining of a toothache before falling to the ground in the final moment. (Spoiler alert: Raver has closed her deal to return next season, THR has learned.)  On McCreary’s part, in a previous interview with The Hollywood Reporter about her exit, the actress left the door open to cycle back into the show in the future, similar to exiting stars before her (Kate Walsh appeared in three episodes this season, reprising her Dr. Addison Montgomery). “I love that about the show, that people come back. I think it’s open. I think that’s a question for Meg Marinis, who is the new showrunner. But I am open to it and I think the storyline leaves it pretty open,” she said. Speaking to the finale, she later added to THR, “It seems like even though she’s gone to Chicago, Maggie and Winston’s story isn’t over. I’m happy to see there’s still love, respect — and of course a lot of heat between them.”  The finale also brings an end to Krista Vernoff’s run as showrunner, as she passes over the reins to Marinis for the 20th season of ABC’s longest-running primetime scripted series, created by Shonda Rhimes. Vernoff and Marinis co-wrote “Wedding Bell Blues,” while Marinis wrote “Happily Ever After?” The episodes were directed by Kevin McKidd and Debbie Allen, respectively.  Since her high-profile exit, Pompeo has remained an executive producer and the show’s narrator. She remains in the ABC family with her next show under her Disney deal being a Hulu limited series. The door remains open for her Grey’s return, per sources, and while her involvement in season 20 has yet to be made official, the finale certainly set up more to explore with Meredith Grey.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS90di90di1uZXdzL2dyZXlzLWFuYXRvbXktZmluYWxlLWNsaWZmaGFuZ2VyLW1lcmVkaXRoLWdyZXktZWxsZW4tcG9tcGVvLXJldHVybnMtMTIzNTQ5NTczMy_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaG9sbHl3b29kcmVwb3J0ZXIuY29tL3R2L3R2LW5ld3MvZ3JleXMtYW5hdG9teS1maW5hbGUtY2xpZmZoYW5nZXItbWVyZWRpdGgtZ3JleS1lbGxlbi1wb21wZW8tcmV0dXJucy0xMjM1NDk1NzMzL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Duchess of Sussex moved her groom to tears in the classic silk gown in pure white, with a 15ft veil embroidered with flowers of the Commonwealth.  The dress, designed by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy, was minimal yet classic, the main focus being the open bateau neckline that gracefully framed the shoulders and sculpted Meghan's waist.  However, another wedding dress would soon be on view that day - five years ago today. And this one wowed the crowds in quite a different way.  For the wedding ceremony at St George's Chapel, Windsor, on May 19, 2018, Meghan wore a pure white silk Givenchy dress  The elegant dress by designer Clare Waight Keller had a simple bateau neckline and a long train  As with other royal brides, Meghan changed into a second dress for the evening, this time opting for a bespoke Stella McCartney design  The ceremony had taken place St George's, Windsor, on May 19 2018 in front of 600 guests.  Afterwards, however, 200 of the bride and groom's closest friends and family went on to Frogmore House on the Windsor estate for an evening reception hosted by Prince Charles .  As with other royal brides, Meghan changed into a second dress for the intimate gathering, this time opting for a bespoke Stella McCartney design.  While the first dress was expected to be a 'traditional and elegant' wedding gown, the second was a modest yet more glamorous number.  The slinky evening dress was made from silk crepe and the halter neck gown was pure white just like Meghan's £200,000 Givenchy number for the ceremony.  The backless number allowed the Duchess of Sussex to show off her toned shoulders and back and the figure-hugging gown featured a dramatic fluted skirt.  Meghan paired the evening gown with heels by Aquazurra made in silky satin with nude mesh and soles painted in baby blue.  Meghan wore an aquamarine ring belonging to the late Lady Diana Spencer, thought to have been a sentimental gift from Prince Harry so as to include his mother on the big day.  The evening halter-neck dress was made from silk crepe and the halter neck gown was pure white. Here Meghan and Harry are pictured leaving Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House  The happy newlyweds danced the night away following an outfit change  The low-cut design of the evening gown showed off Meghan's back and shoulders  Meghan shows of an acquamarine ring that had once belonged to her mother-in-law, Diana  Prince Harry also had an outfit change into a sleek dinner suit with black tie as he and Meghan headed to the reception in an ice-blue vintage Jaguar.  Sharing a sketch of the design Meghan wore to the evening reception in 2018, British designer, Stella McCartney said:  'I am so proud and honoured to have been chosen by the Duchess of Sussex to make her evening gown and represent British design.  'It has truly been one of the most humbling moments of my career and I am so proud of all the team on this stunning sunny royal day,' she told fashion magazine Women's Wear Daily.  Many had suspected that Meghan would choose McCartney, given the designer's stance against using fur and leather, as well as her use of organic fabrics - an outlook which fits with Meghan and Harry's eco-friendly principles  Stella McCartney spoke of her pride as she shared a sketch of the evening halter neck gown  Unlike the dress worn during the ceremony, the evening gown had a smaller train and the slinky material meant Meghan and Harry could dance the night away.  Her hair - styled by George Northwood - was up in a tight bun with face-framing layers, which perfectly suited the dress and the less-formal evening occasion.  Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage revealed to Femail that the gown would probably have cost around £80,000 for fabric, design and fittings.  Kate, the Princess of Wales, also wore two wedding dresses on her big day in 2011, which were both designed by Alexander McQueen's Sarah Burton.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA1MDI1Ny9NZWdoYW5zLVNFQ09ORC13ZWRkaW5nLWdvd24tZ2xhbW9yb3VzLW51bWJlci1kYW5jZWQtbmlnaHQtYXdheS1IYXJyeS5odG1s0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9mZW1haWwvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjA1MDI1Ny9hbXAvTWVnaGFucy1TRUNPTkQtd2VkZGluZy1nb3duLWdsYW1vcm91cy1udW1iZXItZGFuY2VkLW5pZ2h0LWF3YXktSGFycnkuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Is there a proper way to notify them of the wedding without inviting them? My brother’s family and my aunt and uncle all have clear qualms about queer relationships. I think they’d also be offended not to be invited. I would like to find the most gracious means to handle this.  GENTLE READER: The most gracious thing would be to invite them, as this demonstrates trust that they are fundamentally decent and care about you as a member of their family first, putting any other opinions they may hold second.  But Miss Manners infers that past behaviors have convinced you that such trust would be misplaced, and that they will be unpleasant no matter what you do. Better, then, to omit them from the guest list and leave it at that. They will learn about the nuptials and can gnash their teeth without any action on your part.  DEAR MISS MANNERS: I invited a group to dinner at my home to celebrate the expected return of another friend from a long residence overseas. The guest of honor immediately suggested I change the date to better match the schedule of another guest; I did so.  Then I learned that several of the guests had a private conversation to set up an even better date for all of them as an alternative. I was not privy to this conversation until after they had decided on a new date -- one on which I was not available to attend, much less host. In the meantime, the original invitation was still out there, though I now knew that most of the guests had planned another event. How should I have treated the original invitation?  GENTLE READER: As your guests are likely as confused about the original invitation as Miss Manners, she suggests you call everyone to review the bidding.

""And in no way shape or form did I go into that thinking anything, and I've just been taking things very, very, slow and really enjoying myself.""

Viewers of VPR know a scandal unfolded off screen this season with the revelation that Madix's boyfriend of nine years was having an affair with coworker Raquel Leviss, 28.

At a news conference Thursday, North Miami Beach Police officials said it was a carjacking gone wrong.  Police said fingerprints and ballistic evidence helped link Redmon to the crime.

On the night of April 28, a golf cart carrying four people was struck from behind by an alleged drunk driver near Charleston, South Carolina, killing 34-year-old Samantha Miller and critically injuring her new husband, Aric Hutchinson, and two others.  The couple had just celebrated their wedding earlier that day, ABC News reported previously.  Hutchinson spoke to “Good Morning America” in his first interview since the tragic accident that killed his wife, sharing how he’s coping with the immense loss after what he says had been a perfect day.  “She was so happy. I mean, planning a wedding, as most people know, is extremely stressful. And she just had a weird, like, calmness that night,” said Hutchinson, who added that the wedding and the reception were one of the best nights of his life.  According to a GoFundMe set up by Hutchinson’s mother, Hutchinson broke both legs, parts of his face, and his back, and suffered brain bleeds and numerous cuts in the accident. The two others in the golf cart with Hutchinson and Miller suffered injuries including severe road rash and open wounds, according to Charleston ABC affiliate WCIV.  The driver of the vehicle that struck the golf cart, Jamie Komoroski, 25, was arrested and charged with three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and one count of reckless homicide. Komoroski was allegedly driving 65 miles per hour in a 25 miles per hour zone when the crash happened, according to a police report released by the Folly Beach Department of Public Safety.  Hutchinson said he’s not ready to address the driver at this time.  “I can’t right now,” he said. “I’d like to. I mean, she stole an amazing human being that should not have been taken.”  ABC News’ Will McDuffie contributed to this report.  Copyright © 2023, ABC Audio.

Timing is everything.”  “Her zest for life inspires me and definitely keeps me on my toes,” says Julie, who proposed to Angela at home in Phoenix, Arizona, the day before the couple left for a getaway to Spain.

Almost exactly four years later, they took the next big step when Brad got down on one knee in Santorini, Greece.  The duo got right to wedding planning. “We chose our venue and most vendors in 2018, and it was smooth sailing—until we called it off in April 2020,” Elizabeth remembers. “The hardest part of the planning process was postponing our wedding and trusting that things would come together the following year. It turned out to be such a blessing in disguise and I’m grateful we had the extra time to make our wedding weekend outstanding. In the end, we were engaged for 1,117 days—which became a bit of a joke among our friends and family, but it worked for us! When you’re vowing to be together forever, what’s another year or three?”  Timing aside, it was the vision that mattered, and it came together flawlessly. For Elizabeth and Brad, the wedding was more than one day. It actually turned into a whole weekend affair. “I think I decided I’d get married at Roche Harbor when I was about 13,” the bride laughs. ""So, I was quite relieved when Brad enthusiastically agreed. San Juan Island is one of my favorite places on earth, and Roche Harbor Resort in particular holds special significance for my family.” Her family has been visiting there since the 1960s. Now, there was a chance to show off this sliver of the Pacific Northwest to all of their family and friends joining from out of state.  “We wanted the weekend to feel like an all-inclusive, elevated summer camp experience,” Elizabeth says. “Many of our guests arrived by seaplane, which set the tone for a unique adventure. We created a calendar of events and wanted each night to feel distinct and slightly more formal than the previous, and provide ample quality time to mix our friend groups.” Festivities began on Thursday, when the bridal party kicked off the weekend with a luau dinner at Westcott Bay Shellfish Co., complete with lawn games and root beer floats. There was a whale-watching excursion for guests arriving Friday, a welcome dinner, and a send-off brunch on Sunday.  Of course, there was also the main event. “Our Saturday wedding day was a marathon,” Elizabeth adds. Read on to see all the incredible details, planned by Kaleb Norman James and photographed by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography.  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  “We began our wedding day with a 7 a.m. ‘polar plunge’ into the 55-degree water of Puget Sound,” Elizabeth recounts. “It was such a fun and memorable way to kick off the big day. My mom brought everyone doughnuts, and then my bridesmaids and I dashed back to our room for hair and makeup.” Her beauty vision was natural and understated, with eyelash extensions for a little extra oomph. “My updo matched the simplicity of my dress; it felt very bridal.""  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Wedding dress shopping was a family affair. She found her off-the-shoulder Carolina Herrera gown at the since-shuttered Nordstrom Wedding Suite in Seattle. “My mom and I found not only my dress, but also hers and a new suit for my dad!” Elizabeth says. “I knew this dress was the one as soon as I put it on: It was an elegant yet simple design that let me shine through.”  She went all in on the something old, new, borrowed, and blue tradition, with her most meaningful accessory being a veil. “My mom handmade it from the lace and layers of her own wedding dress, which she cut up to create my veil,” Elizabeth says. “It was gorgeous and such a meaningful addition to my look.”  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  “Brad wore a blue suit with a subtle windowpane pattern,” Elizabeth describes. “He stood out from the groomsmen who wore navy, but they all had matching ties, white shirts, and chestnut-brown shoes.”  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  The couple was playful with their first look—Elizabeth tried tricking Brad by tapping the wrong shoulder, but he couldn’t be fooled. They share, “As we finished our photos, we looked up and realized my dad was standing on the balcony above us, so he was able to witness the moment as well!”  Photo by Janine Licare Fine Art Photography  “My bridesmaids represented women from different stages in my life. It was so inspiring to see new friendships blossoming between girls I’d known separately for a long time, but had yet to meet each other.” She gave the girls autonomy in selecting their dress, as long as it was full-length in a blue-green color palette.

What happened?’ Well, we were all scream-singing to Backstreet Boys while wearing silent disco headphones!” Guests could set their headphones to a pop channel curated by the bride or a classic rock channel created by the groom.

Young Ria longs to be a stunt woman. Elder sis Lena attends art school.  But when her parents invite a handsome young doctor for dinner, Lena’s resolve melts.  To Ria’s disgust, Lena says yes to Salim’s proposal.  Ninja wannabe Ria gathers her BFFs, Clara and Alba, to concoct a multi-phase scheme to disrupt the marriage by any means necessary – up to and including spin kicks in wedding dresses.  Ria’s inept kung fu moves just add to the fun.  The amusing marital mash up ends in preposterous fashion with a sci-fi twist.  Usually such silliness annoys me, but two qualities saved “Polite Society.”  First, Nida Manzoor’s British film about a traditional Pakistani family takes pointed, but loving shots, at the submissive role of women in their culture. Ria and Lena both intend to forge their own path.  All goes well until Lena opts to trade her feminist sensibility for the accoutrements of gold digging.  Outraged, Ria, the kick-ass-sister, pledges to fight the good feminist fight, with BFFs Alba and Clara at her side.  But it’s the love between sisters that holds “Polite Society” together.  Ria’s war against her sister’s marriage is partly adolescent jealousy (“I’m prettier!”), but partly separation grief. Ria senses their deep friendship will likely end as sis sells out and moves away.  Ria’s clumsy kicks hide a broken heart.  The ninja shenanigans that cover up tears are actually quite sweet.  In the end, Ria establishes her own YouTube brand: “I am the fury!” Bruce Lee beware.  My runner-up in the “one liner” raffle was “give me that womb!”  That demand refers to Salim’s secret pursuit of the perfect repository for his perfect sperms.  The title “Polite Society” is a subversive stab at rules that try to keep young ladies from breaking the glass ceiling. Manzoor’s script is incisive, clever and outrageous in equal portions.  She’s blowing up movie norms at the same time she revolts against patriarchal Pakistani values.  So what have we here, anyway?  “Polite Society” is an irreverent attack on Pakistani patriarchy crafted with love and affection for all – and including lots of kung fu action.  “Bend it Like Beckham” has a sequel: Bend it like Ria!","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaGVsZW5haXIuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmx5aW5nLXNpc3RlcnMtc3Bpbi1raWNrcy1pbi13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzZXMvYXJ0aWNsZV8wODEzNjM1Mi1mNDI4LTExZWQtYWJhMi1lZmE5M2IyNjVjMWMuaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

(WAVY) – The search is on for the owner of a wedding ring lost at the Virginia Beach Oceanfront.  It started with a normal day at the beach for Michelle Salisbury. Her family was visiting from Bedford, Va.  “We were out playing with the kids, hanging out. We noticed they were looking all over the place like panicked, looking for something,” she said.  They were told a woman lost her ring in the sand.  “This woman was just brushing sand off her hands and her wedding ring flew off,” Salisbury said.  She lent the group some sand tools for the search, but nothing helped.  The group canceled the search and left the area.  Once Salisbury’s husband came back from the bathroom, she relayed the unfortunate news to him.  That’s when he noticed something sparkly in the sand.  “He looked down and the ring was right there. We took off to the boardwalk trying to see if they were still up there,” Salisbury said.  The people searching for the ring were nowhere to be found.  Salisbury turned to the internet for help.  “You know what it’s a shot in the dark, but crazy things have happened. Maybe they’ll see it,” she said.  More than 400,000 people have viewed the Tik Tok, but it hasn’t led to a perfect ring match yet.  “If it was me, I would want someone to help. It’s important. It’s your wedding ring. That’s deep. That’s in your heart,” Salisbury said.  She’s hoping to return the ring as soon as possible.  Salisbury said if someone recognizes the ring to contact her on social media.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdnkuY29tL25ld3MvYmVkZm9yZC13b21hbi11c2VzLXRpay10b2stdG8tZmluZC10aGUtb3duZXItb2Ytd2VkZGluZy1yaW5nLWZvdW5kLWluLXZhLWJlYWNoLW9jZWFuZnJvbnQv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2F2eS5jb20vbmV3cy9iZWRmb3JkLXdvbWFuLXVzZXMtdGlrLXRvay10by1maW5kLXRoZS1vd25lci1vZi13ZWRkaW5nLXJpbmctZm91bmQtaW4tdmEtYmVhY2gtb2NlYW5mcm9udC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The grounds of the Inn will be arranged as if today were the day, and you can view just how special everything will be, during their Wedding Open House.  “We’ve hosted wedding shows in the past, but nothing quite like this one,” says ElizaBeth Hacker, Director of Sales at the Inn at Harbor Shores. “We will have everything set up as if it were your actual wedding taking place! The ceremony space will be set up in our Riverside Tent, tables and chairs will occupy the second floor Harborview Ballroom, and our Waterside Room will host a bar set up for cocktail hour. A Bridal Room set up will also be located in our Marina View Boardroom.”  With the anticipation of over one hundred guests passing through during the afternoon, the Inn at Harbor Shores can’t wait for you to see the gorgeous space. Complimentary hors d’oeuvres will be passed around by the friendly staff, and a cash bar will be available. Attendees will receive a complimentary ticket for their signature wedding cocktail, so you can sip deliciously while you peruse the venue.

"wedding","2023-07-01","16:00:00","{""Galway"", ""Galway"", ""Ireland""}","Thu 18 May 2023 11:04:26","GALWAY — The town’s code enforcement officer has issued a stop work order on a 5,222-square-foot wedding barn because the owners built it without Planning Board oversight, permits and environmental or traffic studies.  “It’s not a legal building,” said town code officer Treavor Gilday concerning Star Farm Blueberries’s barn, owned and built by Chuck and JoAnn Fetter. “They built it without a permit. They are operating without a CO (certificate of occupancy). We summonsed them to court. The court will decide if there are fines. There are a lot of issues.”  Those issues also include disregarding fire code regulations, which landed Chuck Fetter on Wednesday in front of the Albany Regional Board of Review, a committee of the Department of State, where he was questioned about bypassing the installation of sprinklers and other fire suppression items like lit exits and silent alarms in the bathroom.  Chuck Fetter argued that he shouldn’t need all the fire safety measures as the food is brought in, not cooked on site. Besides, he argued, wedding guests come for the ceremony, not the food.  “They don’t primarily come to eat,” Fetter argued to the board. The meeting was held in Albany, but could also be viewed online. “It’s not the main focus. They go primarily for a wedding.”  Sign up for the Saratoga Now newsletter Keep up with the latest happening in Saratoga Springs, Clifton Park, Ballston Spa and other communities in Saratoga County. Sign up here.  However, the board dismissed his appeal to keep the wooden pole barn fire-suppression free. They adjourned to discuss the case at a future meeting.  While Chuck Fetter did not immediately return a Times Union phone call on Wednesday, he admitted to the board that his approach to building the venue “was a mistake,” but “I didn’t think it was catastrophic.”  “It’s a good spot for weddings,” Chuck Fetter told the board.  There are other problems, too — mainly noise emanating from Fetters’ Galway Road farm that is upsetting neighbors. Donna Miller said music plays loudly throughout receptions, and many of the events include fireworks.  “I hope they will be conscientious and recognize their neighbors,” Miller said. “It’s assumed that they would take into consideration what their wedding venue clients are requesting in regards to noise, particularly to take notice if fireworks are to be used.”  Fireworks require permits, said town Clerk Margaret DeFoe, and she said the couple has never sought a permit for their firework displays.  Noise is the same issue that plagued the neighbors of S&S Saratoga Farm in Saratoga. After a long court battle, the town, which was considering changing the zoning to allow weddings there, finally dropped the idea. Weddings, the town said, were not a permitted use in that area.  Galway resident Tom O’Brien said he’s not happy the Fetters never notified neighbors of their plans. While not completely against a wedding venue there, he has said he is concerned about what could happen next if the town allows Star Farm to build what it wants without oversight.  “Who’s to say that doesn’t change to be a brewery or a bar with (Fetter’s) lack of respect for the town and its regulations,” O’Brien said at a February Town Board meeting. “How does the town keep people from building anything they want?”  Some Town Board members also appear concerned. Councilman Fred Arnold said in an April Town Board meeting, minutes show, that Fetter continues “to do what he wants” even with a cease-and-desist order.  Meanwhile, Star Farm Blueberries continues to advertise as a wedding venue, giving its wedding packages as much play as its blueberries on its website.  “The residents of Galway need to know that there are local laws about construction that are to be adhered to,” Miller said. “If not, it will otherwise open the flood gate and people will get away with just constructing anything without permits.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRpbWVzdW5pb24uY29tL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9nYWx3YXktYmx1ZWJlcnJ5LWZhcm0tYnVpbGRzLXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWUtcGVybWl0cy0xODEwMzA1NS5waHDSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2022-09-01","Not Discerned","{""Philadelphia"", ""Pennsylvania"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 17:32:22","Why Philly Bridal Designer Jovan O’Connor Wore Three Different Gowns for Her Wedding  Her couture ceremony dress was inspired by Sex and the City.  Delivering the latest in style, inspiration, helpful tips and tricks, and everything else you need to know to plan the perfect Philly wedding.  Remember when we told you bridal designer Jovan O’Connor would don two wedding gowns for her Big Day? Well, she ended up sporting three. It’s not too, too much of a surprise, though. She hinted at a bonus look when we chatted with her shortly before her September 2022 wedding. All of them were fabulous — much like Jovan and her groom, whose Morris Arboretum & Gardens wedding was sweet but stylish. Petronella Photography snapped the fashionable festivities below.  It pays to strike up a conversation with a stranger every now and again — at least for Philly-born designer Jovan O’Connor and Kevin Keller, a contractor who hails from Wisconsin. The two met on a sweltering day in August 2010 at Starbucks. He joked that her Frappuccino was not real coffee. She mentioned the heat wave. And that broke the ice. A decade after that, in July 2020, Kevin proposed.  They were engaged for two years before saying “I do” at Morris Arboretum & Gardens in Chestnut Hill. They chose the picturesque spot for its beautiful landscape and history. Their theme was garden chic, and they worked with women-owned businesses and creatives to pull off their dream day.  “As a business owner, it was very important to me to highlight the talents of women,” says the bride.  It was also important to her to dress the part for her own wedding. “After designing for so many others’ special days, I was thrilled to be able to wear something that I created for the biggest day of my life,” says Jovan. She’d designed a bridal collection prior to the wedding, but Kevin had seen the gowns already — and even helped create them. So she needed something new. And not just one, but three.  Let’s start with the bride’s favorite — her couture ceremony dress and veil. They were inspired by the first Sex and the City movie. “I wanted to re-create that moment when Carrie tries on different wedding dresses,” she says. Jovan’s dress was made of feathers and ivory silk taffeta, with a pleated drape and bubble hem.  Kevin didn’t miss the significance of the style. One of his favorite wedding details was seeing Jovan come down the aisle in her gown.  As for the other two? The first was a Justin Alexander design that she’d altered. She decided to wear it on the way to the venue “instead of something like a casual outfit because I was in full bridal mode” and for the first look.  The final costume change was for the reception, into a pearl-filled stunner. Think pearl hand-embroidered lace from Brussels, stringed pearls on the shoulders and sleeves, pearl buttons down the back, and a fishtail bottom filled with pearl-adorned draped godets.  Of course, it wasn’t just about the fashions. There were also sentimental decor touches — the couple used Jovan’s grandmother’s dinnerware, with its pretty floral detailing, at the reception.  And Jovan and Kevin felt all the love from their 76 guests.  “Everyone we invited has a special part in our story, and to see people who have known and supported our love from the beginning was exactly the vibe we were going for,” says Jovan.

A frugal feast of Chili’s Grill & Bar chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, salads and more delicious Tex-Mex grub wound up stealing the show at Southern belle Madison Mulkey’s wedding.  The practically minded Savannah, Georgia peach turned to the chain restaurant as a thrifty alternative to traditional catering — which can cost an average of $75 per guest, according to wedding website the Knot.  The spread, which Mulkey shared with her followers on TikTok, where the video has been viewed more than 1.3 million times, wound up a steal at $1,950 for 99 guests — a far cry from the $7,500 Mulkey says she would have had to spend on the usual chicken-or-fish extravaganza.  “First of all, we loved the price point,” Mulkey said in the TikTok. “You really can’t beat that price point. You just can’t.”  But, saving thousands of dollars on her big day came with some surprising hidden costs — Mulkey said she had to spend more time and energy coordinating pickup for the food than if she’d hired someone to worry about it for her.  Savannah, Ga., bride Madison Mulkey’s Chili’s-catered wedding has gone viral on TikTok. TikTok/brideisapersonality  Guests at the wedding enjoyed a wide selection of Chili’s classic Tex-Mex fare. Chili's Grill & Bar  “We had to pick it up pretty early because we didn’t want to pay for the delivery fees,” Mulkey noted.  That meant the bride-to-be wound up waiting at her local Chili’s at 11 o’clock on the morning of her wedding day. Luckily, she was able to corral the crew at her reception location, who made sure the food was hot, ready, and artfully presented that evening.  “That was just a lot more work than we had anticipated,” Mulkey admitted, noting the added pressure placed on venue staff.  And while plenty of Mulkey’s followers saluted her savvy, others expressed concern over the undue burden borne by workers who perhaps weren’t properly trained to prepare and present someone else’s food.  “As someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,” one La-Z-Boy labor expert sniped, calling out the bride for skimping.  Mulkey followed up her first video with a clarification — she did tip the Chili’s kitchen staff $300, and that the venue employees were paid hourly, including for any extra time they may have spent on preparation.  The total bill was an entirely resasonable $1,950.04 — plus the $300 tip Mulkey says she handed to kitchen staff. TikTok/brideisapersonality  Some skeptics remained unconvinced.  “Servers aren’t cooks, they serve people, not serve whatever purpose you need,” a commenter complained.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NoaWxpcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXRvLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtd2VkZGluZy1jYXRlcmluZy1mb3Itb25lLWJyaWRlL9IBYWh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE4L2NoaWxpcy10aGUtc2VjcmV0LXRvLWFmZm9yZGFibGUtd2VkZGluZy1jYXRlcmluZy1mb3Itb25lLWJyaWRlL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Before couples decide on color schemes, flower arrangements and dessert options, the feat of selecting the perfect venue is at the top of most wedding-planning checklists.  There’s good news for those looking to get married in Southern California: San Diego County is isn’t slacking when it comes to majestic landscapes perfect for saying “I do.”  From coastal cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean to green valleys tucked between mountain ranges, here are five wedding venues with a view in the region:  The Condor’s Nest Ranch  This rustic wedding venue sits on a 15-acre property in Pala that beholds panoramic views that span all the way to the coast. Couples can share their vows beneath a 200-year-old ash tree as it sways in the wind to the expression of love. This venue is ideal for those who wish to get married surrounded by nature and views of the countryside.  The Coaster Terrace at Belmont Park  Couples who choose this venue to celebrate their big day can expect white sand views of Pacific Beach. With direct view of the westward ocean, this post could make for a perfect sunset wedding. Another quirky yet #SoSanDiego feature is that the venue is just steps from the giant Dipper roller coaster, which adds to an unforgettable view.  Wild Weddings at San Diego Zoo Safari Park  For some, love can be a wild adventure. Couples can enjoy a “romance safari” with wedding day views of giraffes, zebras and rhinos on an African-like savannah located right here in Southern California at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. The venue area has lush green foliage and there are even options to add-on “wow-worthy wildlife animal presentations,” according to the park’s webpage.  Coronado Cays Yacht Club  This venue offers up a tranquil setting with direct views of the San Diego Bay and Coronado. It’s located right at the edge of the sandy shore, making for great lighting and photo opportunities. This spot could have sailboats poised in the background, birds flying overhead and is simple enough to make the newlyweds the main focus.  Lakehouse Hotel & Resort  This North County venue is located on the edge of Lake San Marcos, offering less salty yet still awing views of the water. Also surrounding the area — green upon green — with golf courses that create a quaint and clean wedding day vibe. Wedding day sights may even include some boating passersby or some lakeside wildlife.  If there’s one thing that’s for certain when it comes to saying “I do,” no matter which San Diego County venue you choose — the view will be a fairytale come true.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvNS13ZWRkaW5nLXZlbnVlcy13aXRoLWFuLWktZG8tdmlldy1pbi1zYW4tZGllZ28v0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy81LXdlZGRpbmctdmVudWVzLXdpdGgtYW4taS1kby12aWV3LWluLXNhbi1kaWVnby9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But property owners are looking for a divorce from uninvited guests.  It’s springtime and, without notice, a black cloud takes over the skies. Made up of tens of thousands of black dots flying in seemingly every direction at once, the cloud settles into a nearby tree branch.  “You’ll hear it before you see it and then there’s a tornado of bees around. That’s how they reproduce, and good luck talking an animal out of reproducing, right?” beekeeper Phil Hucky said.  The bees are searching for their new home and a new place to create a new hive.  Standing inside the attic of Pinecroft Manor, Hucky is faced with cutting out a nearly 100-year-old floor to retrieve a beehive that has built up between the joists.  “This is really the only way to get into a hive like this there’s no access from the outside from underneath anything like that,” Hucky said. “Honeybees are cavity dwellers so they’re looking for a space roughly this big which is perfect between the first and second floor houses the joist space is that size and so they’re looking for those spaces to move into.”  Swarms on trees in a yard or ones that show up on the side of a home or car can often be captured for free by an area beekeeper from the Southwest Ohio Beekeepers Association or SWOBA. Hucky says the association’s website has the resources homeowners need.  “There’s a very large list of people broken up by region local beekeepers that will come and assist you and take that hive off your hands, typically free of charge,” he said.  However, once the bees have found a quarter-inch hole or larger on the side of a home and move into the eaves or walls it can become pricey. There’s no set price within the industry and cutout services can range from a couple hundred to a few thousand dollars.  Hucky said homeowners want to make sure they hire someone that understands the construction and has the proper tools for the job.  While someone’s first response to a honeybee swarm might be to grab the insect spray and kill the bees, Hucky said please don’t do it for a variety of reasons.  “If the spray was to kill the hive you still have all that brood and all that honey and it will be like having a large dead animal in the wall,” Hucky said. “If that hives been poisoned, you’re not only poisoning that hive you could potentially poison other hives in the area.”  He said other honeybees will pick up the scent left behind by the propolis in the hive and could visit the poisoned hive and then carry the pesticide to other hives in the area several miles away.    The good news is while honeybees can swarm at any time, they predominately swarm between April and June, which means we’re about midway through this year’s swarm season.  If you find the need for a beekeeper to take care of a swarm in your area, visit the SWOBA website and click the 'Swarm Removal' link at the top of the page.

The pageant contestant, 23, who is pursuing her master's degree in theology, wed her long-time partner Taylor Reed Locklear in a ""romantic"" ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina on April 29.  The couple exchanged vows in front of 350 family and friends at the historic St. Philip's Church, where they also got engaged a year earlier.  ""My favorite moment on our wedding day was when I walked down the aisle. For me, time stopped,"" Morehouse tells PEOPLE exclusively.  ""As I draped the blusher of my veil over my face, I held onto my dad's arm. The doors to our church sanctuary opened, and Highland Cathedral began to play. While the bagpipes and the trumpet echoed throughout the church, the moment felt very regal.""  The pair's love story began when Morehouse was a high school senior and Locklear had just graduated from the Citadel Military College of South Carolina. They ran into each other at Morehouse's family's annual Christmas party.  The next day Locklear asked Morehouse out to dinner, and the rest was history. ""Since that first dinner, Taylor has always been a constant in my life,"" she says. ""He never lets a day go by without telling me he loves me, and that is a gift I will never take for granted.""  Taylor Rae Photography  The pageant star walked down the aisle on the arm of her father in a custom lace gown featuring a ruffled skirt created by Israeli designer Pnina Tornai, whose designs have been featured on Sex and the City and Say Yes to the Dress. Morehouse carried a bouquet of pink and white flowers and her stunning veil featured a long train that trailed behind her.  Following the nuptials, the newlywed's reception was held at the nearby Hibernian Hall, where guests were led by a bagpiper dressed in a traditional kilt.  ""As the first Miss USA contestant to get married during her reign as a state titleholder, I hope to show women that it is possible to get married and still chase your dreams,"" says Morehouse.  In August 2022, the Miss USA organization announced in a press release that they were changing their rules for contestants. ""Effective with the 2023 Miss USA competition and state preliminary competitions, women who are or have been married, as well as women who are pregnant or have children, will be able to compete,"" read the release.  ""Marriage is a wonderful institution, and I am pleased that the Miss Universe Organization is empowering women to do both,"" says Morehouse. ""My husband's love and support has refined me into the woman I am, so he is certainly on the road to Miss USA with me.""  Juliana Morehouse and Taylor Reed Locklear. Taylor Rae Photography  The couple's reception hall was decorated with pink, lilac and red florals where guests were served signature cocktails — the Queen's Rose for her and the Gentleman's Old Fashioned for him — and treated to a champagne tower poured by the bride and groom.  Meanwhile, their wedding menu consisted of food stations that featured oysters, sushi, beef tenderloin with green beans and potatoes, mac and cheese with the option to add extras such as crab and grits, and scallops with risotto. And to fuel the late-night dancing — with a soundtrack provided by the Soul Psychedelique Orchestra — the celebrations ended with mini cheeseburger sliders.

When it came to dessert, the couple served mini key lime pies and banana puddings as well as their gorgeous, floral-covered wedding cake — a four-tier classic vanilla cake with buttercream icing and carrot cake with cream cheese icing.  For the evening celebrations, Morehouse changed into a party dress and as a nod to her pageant career, she added a light-up tiara and her Miss Maine USA sash.  Taylor Rae Photography  Some of the couple's guests who have a Miss USA connection — including Morehouse's mom, who is a former Miss North Carolina USA — also brought along their sashes and posed for a picture. Other guests were also gifted their very own sashes and tiaras and were snapped tossing a cardboard cutout of Morehouse being crowned Miss Maine USA into the air as they danced.  When planning her nuptials, Morehouse says she wanted a ""romantic, spirit-filled, fun"" day. ""Most of all, I hoped for a day that my husband and I could enjoy with our loved ones, and that we did,"" she adds  The newlyweds are now enjoying their honeymoon in Italy, with stops in Rome, Positano, and Capri, and they are looking forward to their future together.

"wedding","2024-05-01","Not Discerned","{""LosAngeles"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Thu 18 May 2023 22:44:00","Scroll To See More Images  If your Instagram feed turned into a bridal page the second the calendar hit May 1, you’re not alone. The prime time of wedding season is upon us and that includes proposals, bachelorettes and of course, the big day. If you fall into one of those wedding categories or just love all things bridal, consider the next few months your opportunity to admire (and silently judge) every wedding trend, choice and dress that you see IRL or online. Weddings are kind of like individual Met Galas—whether you’re attending, participating or just watching from afar it’s fun to have an opinion! Approach the subject with expertise by getting familiar with all of the new wedding trends for 2024. If you’re planning a 2024 wedding, now is the time to understand what themes and trends are on the horizon.  Weddings are, of course, a highly personal event which means that nobody is required or even encouraged to follow trends. These new wedding trends for 2024 simply exist to provide additional inspiration for the wedding day and wardrobe. That being said, the wedding dress trends for 2024 deserve your attention. They are playful, daring, and even a little bit dramatic.  If there’s anyone that’s ahead of bridal trends it’s Hope LaVine, a Los Angeles-based bridal stylist and influencer with over 360k followers across socials. LaVine exclusively covers bridal trends and tries on and reviews new collections herself for an honest first-person perspective. She just returned from bridal fashion week in Barcelona and New York City where she was one of the first to see the designer bridal collections for spring/summer ’24.  According to LaVine, the biggest and most innovative trend to hit the bridal scene in 2024 will be wedding dress separates. And if you’re a 2024 bride, this may work in your favor.  “Social media has told brides that they need to change out of their wedding dress and have a second look or reception outfit. One dress or ‘look’ is no longer enough these days,” LaVine explains. “The bridal designer’s fix for this is offering separates. Gloves, neck scarfs, detachable sleeves, hooded veils, and even transformative dresses. These separates are giving brides their two bridal looks, all within one dress.”  “Galia Lahav is a great example of this.” LaVine continues. ” They have multiple jackets that can be worn with lace long-sleeve jackets, and overskirts and they even have a mermaid wedding dress that becomes a mini dress (pictured above)”.  Versatility is becoming a top priority for brides, especially when a wedding budget comes into play. Another way brides are incorporating multiple looks into their wedding wardrobe is by repurposing older family members’ dresses and accessories. The search for “Repurposing mom’s wedding dress” has over 38.8 million views on TikTok with dozens of viral videos showcasing the process and transformation of vintage pieces.  This viral TikTok video has amassed over 240k likes and documents the process of repurposing a wedding dress from 1988 into a short rehearsal dinner dress with a more modern feel. There are plenty of other videos on the app showing different versions of the same process so it is a great place to look for inspiration if you’re considering doing the same.  If you don’t have a perfect ’80s hand-me-down ready to repurpose, don’t fret! Plenty of designers are incorporating vintage designs into their new collections. The style Hope LaVine is most excited about? Drop waist.  “It’s so interesting seeing the trends cycle back around. Drop waist was very early 2000s, think classic Vera Wang – Victoria Beckham wedding dress. But bridal design trends often mirror fashion trends. With everyone’s resurgence in their obsessions with corsets, it’s no surprise that brides are wanting that snatched look in their wedding dress as well.” LaVine says.  In addition to drop-waist dresses you can expect to see the revival of elegant princess-style gowns, the emergence of capes down the aisle, and the evolution of accessories with a shortened veil in 2024. The good news is that plenty of the trends for 2024 can be incorporated with any wedding aesthetic, so you won’t have to revolve your entire look around one to be able to participate.  Keep reading for the five biggest wedding dress and bridal accessory trends for 2024. Before you know it, these will be on your IG feed too.  Fairytale Princess Gowns  While sleek and modern trend-driven wedding dress silhouettes have been having a moment over the last couple of years, the princess gown has slowly but surely been regaining its power. This dress silhouette capitalizes on the drama and grandeur associated with fairytale romance. The focal point of a princess dress is the large skirt that juts out at the waistline. Beyond this distinguishing feature, there’s plenty of room to customize the style to fit your happily ever after. Monique Lhuillier, for example, featured a dress with a multi-layer tiered skirt and a lace bodice with high-neck and long sleeves in the most recent collection. The dress is reminiscent of old royalty while the skirt detailing makes it more modern. Designer Liz Martinez took a different approach with a simple silhouette but used textured fabric to add dimension to the look.  Dramatic Capes  You don’t need an entire outfit change to make a statement at your wedding. Capes have made a dramatic entrance on the bridal scene. Whether it’s tulle, lace or silk, a cape will elevate your entire bridal look. As presented by Elie Saab, a cape (especially one with a hood) is also a cool alternative to a veil. It will add movement to your look when you walk down the aisle or through cocktail hour and will also look great in photos. One of the best parts about a cape is that they work over a variety of dress silhouettes—if you already have your dress picked out, try a cape over it for good measure.  Flower Appliqués  The flower appliqué or rosette trend is a main character in fashion right now. On any piece of clothing, whether it be a swimsuit, skirt or as demonstrated here, a wedding dress, you can find bold flowers added for extra detail. This is by far the most general trend-driven bridal trend for 2024 but one could argue it’s easily the most natural fit. Choosing a dress with flower detailing can help tie together the overall aesthetic of your wedding. If you’re envisioning a garden party, flower appliqués will obviously fit right in. On the contrary, if you have a very minimalist aesthetic or dress, a large rose, like the one seen at Badgley Mischka, or a cluster of flowers on your shoulder, as shown by Ines de Santo, can add dimension to your look.  Short Veils  Short wedding dresses, specifically for a reception look, are an increasingly common choice for brides—and right along with it we have the emergence of the short veil. The short veil silhouette is both elegant and modern which also makes it a popular choice for the untraditional bride. Unlike a classic long veil, a short veil acts as more of a hair accessory rather than a part of the dress silhouette which is why it’s most usually worn with a shorter or fitted dress style. If you’re planning on changing for the reception or taking a romantic trip to city hall, a short veil is the way to go.  Something (Or Everything) Blue  The tradition of wearing something blue is far from being a trend but having the color incorporated as a main feature in a bridal look definitely is. Brides are embracing the shade and wearing it to compliment classic white bridal pieces. Sareh Nouri’s latest bridal collection does an excellent job of showing how blue can be paired with wedding dresses by adding oversized blue bows, printed fabric or embellished gloves. Oscar de la Renta also has a gorgeous blue lace gown that would work as a wedding dress. The difference between this trend and previous iterations of “something blue” is that these blue pieces are a part of the primary ceremony look and not just used as a subsequent reception accessory.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vc3R5bGVjYXN0ZXIuY29tL3dlZGRpbmctdHJlbmRzLTIwMjQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Eventually, I had to move to the backup plan’s backup plan: a little walk in Central Park as the sun set and the park’s night creatures started to come out of the shadows to greet our newly engaged life in a giant rat-and-cockroach-themed musical number.”  Their wedding was held at the Inn at Perry Cabin in St. Michaels, Maryland, where Hanna’s parents have spent many wedding anniversaries over the years. “It’s also very close to where I grew up in Maryland,” she adds. “And where Wedding Crashers was filmed!”  The rehearsal dinner at the Chesapeake Maritime Museum kicked off the weekend’s festivities. Guests, with cocktails in hand, took boat shuttles over from the Inn at Perry Cabin to a picturesque old boat barn overlooking the water. For this—and the welcome party that followed—Hanna wore a slip made from an antique pattern at Jane Bourvis in Notting Hill that her sister-in-law Sophie Dahl helped choose, and she accessorized with vintage pearl drop clip-on earrings that belong to her grandmother.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3cvbHVrZS1rZWxseS1hbmQtaGFubmEtc2l2ZXJsaW5nLXdlZGRpbmfSAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy52b2d1ZS5jb20vc2xpZGVzaG93L2x1a2Uta2VsbHktYW5kLWhhbm5hLXNpdmVybGluZy13ZWRkaW5nL2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-04-28","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 19:14:01","The groom whose wife was struck and killed in a car crash in South Carolina on the couple's wedding night has sued the alleged drunk driver and the bars she allegedly drank at before she got behind the wheel, according to court documents obtained by NBC News.  The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court, accuses driver Jamie Komoroski, 25, and the owners of five South Carolina bars — Snapper Jacks, The Drop In, The Crab Shack, El Gallo Bar & Grill and Taco Boy, where Komoroski was employed — of negligence and wrongful death in the crash on Folly Beach on April 28 that killed Samantha Miller, 34, of Charlotte, North Carolina, as she and her husband, Aric Hutchinson, 36, were leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart.  The suit alleges that employees of the bars Komoroski allegedly visited the night of April 28 overserved her even though she was “noticeably and visibly intoxicated” and that she got behind the wheel after an alleged “booze-filled day of bar hopping.”  Hutchinson, the groom, was seriously injured, sustaining a brain injury and broken bones. A witness reported that Komoroski “was dazed and confused” at the scene and repeatedly said “I did nothing wrong” and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller at their wedding. via GoFundMe  Hutchinson said Saturday at a memorial in Miller’s honor on Folly Beach that he is feeling “just as good as I can feel with the situation.” He filed the suit both as the representative of Miller's estate and on his own behalf, the complaint says.  Danny Dalton, the attorney representing Miller’s family, said in a statement that the case “is about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly.”  A spokesperson for the state Revenue Department’s alcohol beverage licensing bureau said the state does not require businesses to mandate training for alcohol servers but maintains a list of recommended training programs on its website.  Many states, including South Carolina, allow people to pursue civil actions against businesses that serve intoxicated customers who subsequently cause harm.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm, according to online court records. She remains in custody.  Komoroski’s attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in an email Thursday morning that he was not representing her in the civil case. He said in a statement: “We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.”  The lawsuit also names Komoroski’s workplace, Taco Boy, and an unnamed supervisor of the Folly Beach restaurant as defendants, alleging the supervisor organized a night of drinking for employees before the tragedy unfolded and pressured Komoroski and other attendees to drink heavily. The complaint says the supervisor knew that “Komoroski had a previous history of alcohol abuse,” but it does not elaborate further. It also claims her employers allowed Komoroski ""to simply leave and drive away after having consumed a dangerous amount of alcohol.""  Melissa Reardon, the communications director for Taco Boy, said in a statement that there was no ""organized employee function around drinking"" the day of the crash and that 16 hours of video and interviews with staff members show that Komoroski did not go to the restaurant that day. She added that it was ""untrue"" that Komoroski's supervisor knew anything about an alleged ""previous history of alcohol abuse,"" as the complaint alleges.  Reardon said Komoroski had recently been hired and had trained for only two days before April 28, adding that her employment has been terminated.  ""Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy,"" Reardon said in the statement. ""Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.""  The complaint also alleges that the management of Taco Boy and the managements of the bars Komoroski allegedly visited that night failed to properly train employees to recognize signs of intoxication and prevent overserving.  Reardon said in her statement that restaurant staffers are ""committed to serving alcohol responsibly"" and are required to complete training programs to prevent overserving.  A representative for Snapper Jacks declined to comment and directed calls to a corporate phone number, which no one answered.  Representatives for The Drop In and El Gallo Bar & Grill declined to comment.  A representative for The Crab Shack could not immediately be reached for comment.  Allegations of an alcohol-fueled evening  The lawsuit alleges that Komoroski began her evening drinking at El Gallo Bar & Grill in Charleston before she drove 26 miles south to the city of Folly Beach, where she allegedly drank at three more local bars: The Drop In, The Crab Shack and Snapper Jacks.  “Over the course of several hours, Jamie Komoroski slurred and staggered her way through each of these bars, consuming an assortment of alcoholic beverages, including beer, tequila shots, shift shots of liquor on the house, etc.,” the suit alleges.  “By the end of the night, Jamie Komoroski was grossly and dangerously intoxicated,” it says.  Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, only briefly hit the brakes before her vehicle smashed into the golf cart in Folly Beach, S.C., on April 28. Folly Beach Police Department  Komoroski's blood alcohol content was more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina, which is 0.08%, according to a toxicology report.  The incident report says she told a sergeant at the scene of the crash — on the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue in Folly Beach — that she had two drinks that night, a beer and a “tequila pineapple an hour ago or so.” Komoroski refused to perform any field sobriety tests, and she was swaying as a sergeant asked her to stand up, according to the incident report.  A sergeant said he “smelled an odor of alcohol coming from her breath and person,” the incident report says, adding that Komoroski was driving 65 mph per hour in a 25 mph zone — and in the opposite direction of her home — at the time of the crash.  A quest for accountability  The lawsuit also names as defendants 20 unspecified “Jane Does” who may have contributed to the events.  Also named as plaintiffs, alongside Hutchinson, are Benjamin Garrett, Hutchinson's brother-in-law, and his son, a minor, who were driving the newly married couple in a golf cart back to their accommodations for the evening and suffered ""terrible and permanent injuries,"" the complaint says.

In the evenings, conference attendees enjoyed Island-themed parties — a welcome excuse to sample the many catering options the Vineyard has to offer.  “Vendors are so busy from now until fall that they’ve never have a chance to just sit and talk,” said Alessandra Hagerty, marketing director for the Vineyard Gazette Media Group, which publishes Island Weddings.  Ms. Hagerty planned the conference with Kharma Finley-Wallace of Hoverfly Media after spending 10 years in the Island wedding industry and noticing how few on-Island networking opportunities there were.  More than 50 professionals attended the conference, with a range of vendors to the wedding industry participating in various ways. When not talking wedding shop, attendees cavorted with alpacas courtesy of Island Alpaca, practiced yoga with Yoga on the Vine’s Lora Ksieniewicz, and got a B-12 boost at the Drip Hydration shot bar, among other activities.  A highlight of the conference was a wedding-themed party Tuesday evening at the Grange, featuring a sampling of food and drink from more than a dozen vendors.  “People had the best time,” said Ms. Hagerty. “They were all telling me that this should have been done so long ago.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vdmluZXlhcmRnYXpldHRlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDUvMTgvd2VkZGluZy1wcm9mZXNzaW9uYWxzLWdhdGhlci10aHJlZS1kYXktY29uZmVyZW5jZdIBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Lyndsey McAteer had gastric sleeve surgery to shrink her stomach by 80 per cent in a bid to reach her target weight of 13 stone after a treatment plan and a pregnancy caused her to pile on the pounds.  The mum-of-two, who has endured gruelling chemotherapy and a mastectomy, is now determined to get in shape to tie the knot with her fiancé Martin O’Connor next year.  Lyndsey, from Renfrew, is also training to take part in Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life.  She said: “I still have some weight to lose, but I’m feeling great after losing eight and half stone since my surgery last September.  “I’m getting married next year so I’m determined to get in shape and I’m looking forward to doing Race for Life, I can’t wait. It’s going to be an amazing day and a great way to mark 10 years of being clear of cancer.”  It will be an emotional moment for Lyndsey when she stands on the start line at Glasgow Green ahead of the 5k on May 21. The 40-year-old, who was diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer at just 29, knows exactly how vital it is to raise funds for life-saving research.  She took part in her first Race for Life event in May 2013 just two days after her fourth chemotherapy treatment for the disease, and when Lyndsey returned to take part in the event the following year, she met Martin.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey after chemo  Lyndsey after chemo (Image: Supplied)  This year, her sons Harris, 12, and Ellis, seven, are joining her alongside her best friend Ruth Coulter.  READ MORE: Jordan Owens and Christopher Hughes among clients of crime gang  Lyndsey said “I feel like I’ve been beating the odds every single day since my diagnosis.  “I pushed my son Harris in his pram at my first Race for Life. Now he’s at high school and I can’t believe where that time has gone. Race for Life will always have a special place in my heart, but I know being there will bring back a lot of memories. It’s a chance to say thank you, to pause for a moment and to take in everything that’s happened in my life. Life has been a rollercoaster these past 10 years but I feel blessed to be here.”  Story continues  Lyndsey was a single mum to two-year-old Harris when she found a lump in her left breast. Just four days before Christmas in 2012, tests confirmed she had breast cancer. She had a mastectomy and marked her 30th birthday in hospital recovering from surgery.  Before beginning chemotherapy at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, doctors warned the treatment could make her infertile. She was offered the chance to have her eggs frozen but decided against it.  Lyndsey said: “I already had my son Harris.  “I decided not to freeze my eggs as I didn’t want to delay the chemotherapy starting. Doctors told me there was a high chance of the cancer coming back so I wanted to get the treatment started as soon as possible.”  After chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Lyndsey finished treatment in October 2013. And in early 2015, Lyndsey received a wonderful surprise when she fell pregnant naturally with Ellis, who was born in November. Then, to mark five years free of cancer in 2017, on the anniversary of her diagnosis on December 21, Martin proposed.  Glasgow Times: Lyndsey and Martin O'Connor  Lyndsey and Martin O'Connor (Image: Supplied)  Lyndsey added: “I was overjoyed.  “Some wonderful things have come from something so awful. When I had chemotherapy treatment at 29, I feared I’d never have another child. But my focus at that time had been fighting cancer. That’s why when Ellis came along he really was a little miracle and a sign that cancer didn’t win.”  Race for Life, in partnership with headline sponsor Standard Life, is an inspiring series of 3k, 5k, 10k, Pretty Muddy and Pretty Muddy Kids events which raise millions of pounds every year to help beat cancer by funding crucial research. To mark the 30th year of Race for Life and participants will receive a special medal to mark the milestone.

Here’s a low-down on how city folks tend to weatherproof their wedding planning:Suparna Sarkar , associate VP of a popular wedding destination, said swimming pool venues are in high demand now. “Mehendi, haldi and bachelor parties can be set up around pools quite easily. Clients are also trying to wrap up outdoor rituals early in the morning when the heat is bearable,” she said. Many are also picking summer-friendly menus. “Clients are opting for lighter meals,” said Rongon Neogi from a city catering service. “Fish and chicken dishes are replacing mutton,” he added.""Keeping the weather in mind, we have opted for an AC banquet and tweaked the menu to keep it light.

The newly-weds headed out to Himachal Pradesh on Tuesday for their reception.Manoj Kheria, another wedding planner, anticipates a crunch in AC banquet halls during the upcoming season. “Getting AC banquets for weddings has become next to impossible. Some of our clients have postponed weddings and are opting for destination weddings at hill stations due to the heat. Shorter guest lists are again in vogue like the pandemic days.” To this Aman added, “The guest list is shorter because hill stations don’t offer as many accommodation options as Kolkata or other metros.”Aman shares that outdoor rituals are being curated more cautiously. “We have to ensure that all venues are well-ventilated so that people don’t fall sick. Water sprinklers are being used for haldi rituals. For rituals happening outdoors, we are covering the area and installing temporary ACs and pedestal fans. We are arranging for daaber jol, lassi, fruit juice, ORS, nimbu paani and water along with hats and wet towels.

"wedding","2023-07-01","13:00:00","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 21:54:00","Civil marriages are on the rise in Israel, and this Israel-based organization has been instrumental in doing so. Chuppot, an organization that provides private religious services and challenges Israel's Chief Rabbinate, has officially celebrated more than 1,000 weddings conducted.  The organization reported a 30% increase in inquiries to those from last year. Chuppot organizes marriages legally outside of the official rabbinical establishment. Now, couples from across Israel can seek other ways to seek their marriage contract through official methods without jumping through additional hoops.  The reported increase in marriage requests can be attributed to several factors, but the organization believes this can best be attributed to the current state of uncertainty in Israel. As the atmosphere in Israel has recently been identified as tense, especially regarding those of political and religious significance, many Israelis have sought other opportunities to seek marriages.  Though many Israelis identify as Jewish and follow Jewish tradition, they may find it tough to differentiate between their religious identities and that of government actions. Marriage falls into this category. With the push for Israel's judicial reform, secular Israelis and non-Jewish residents and citizens of the Jewish state find themselves grappling with the laws of a ""halachic state.""  Providing suitable alternatives for the Israeli public  As a result, Chuppot has stepped in to provide a legal alternative for those wishing to be married in the holy land, while removing one official step. Since Israelis may later have to deal with the rabbinate for other reasons, Chuppot acts as a different messenger.  Rabbi Aaron Leibowitz, president and founder of Chuppot, made note of the increase. ""Every year we are aware of a consistent increase in inquiries and demands for the service we offer. This year, we've seen a drastic increase in the number of inquiries and interest in the weddings we conduct. These have come in just a few months, towards the end of the Omer and the beginning of the summer wedding season,"" he said.  ""Chuppot as an organization has set itself the goal of 'being a rabbi where there is no rabbi,' according to the religion of Moses and Israel, even if this means that he will not be registered for marriage with the chief rabbinate, Leibowitz added. ""Our activity is carried out of an absolute commitment to Halacha and the laws of Orthodox Judaism. All rabbinic activity within the project is committed to Halacha and takes place without breaking its boundaries.  ""In cases where the couples encounter a difficult and discriminatory policy, the treatment they receive in chuppahs is open and friendly - one that will allow each couple to express their wishes in the design of the canopy and the ceremony.""  Rivka Arbiv, CEO of Chuppot, elaborated on the different types of couples approaching the organization. ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah. These couples chose to make a 'turn,' to recalculate a route and find a solution that would allow them to hold a Jewish-religious ceremony, but to be freed from the shackles of dependence on the rabbinate.""  Arbiv continued, ""There are also couples who choose an alternative to the rabbis for ideological reasons - beginning with the desire to design a more egalitarian or feminist chuppah ceremony. Some are just tired of the Rabbinate.""  ""There are couples who have encountered a maze of bureaucracy and difficulties with the rabbinical establishment, especially when it comes to finding out about Judaism on the way to the chuppah."" Rivka Arbiv  Arbiv says that couples fearful of religious coercion have significantly contributed to the increase in these numbers.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmpwb3N0LmNvbS9taWRkbGUtZWFzdC9hcnRpY2xlLTc0MzM3OdIBMmh0dHBzOi8vbS5qcG9zdC5jb20vbWlkZGxlLWVhc3QvYXJ0aWNsZS03NDMzNzkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

""It just popped in my head because I saw his overcoat and I said, 'Can you put that on?' And then everything just starts folding together,"" he tells PEOPLE of the creative process.  Ed Feingersh/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty  That spring, Lubomirski was called back to Windsor Castle to shoot Prince Harry and Meghan's historic royal wedding, summing it up as ""probably the most high-pressure job"" he's had to date.  ""That was a blur,"" recalls the photographer, himself the descendant of a Polish princely house. ""I got about two hours of sleep the night before, thinking to myself, 'Okay, do I have everything? How am I going to get everyone in place? How am I going to make the Queen smile?' ""  Given time constraints, Lubomirski tells PEOPLE there wasn't a second to spare — so he inventively made the most of his time with the newly minted Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  ""I'd only had three minutes to get them into the garden, take pictures, and it took three minutes to get them to the garden,"" he says. ""And there was one shot of the couple sitting in the rose garden, which is an image that I got. It was that first time they were alone, as in out of the public site after being married. So it was a really, very special moment, this moment of calm.""  Alexi Lubomirski  Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

He is now slated to become the first person to retain his membership with the Knanaya Archeparchy of Kottayam while marrying a woman from outside the sect. The marriage of Justin with Vijimol has already garnered much attention as the occasion is expected to mark the end of endogamy practised by the community.  After much wrangling with the administrators of his parish, St. Anne’s Church in Kottody, which even witnessed police intervention, the youth is now expected to receive a ‘vivaha kuri’ or consent on Thursday morning. “This is a difficult situation as I am keen on receiving a consent from my Church,” he said.  The stand hitherto  The development assumes significance as the Church has hitherto refused to acknowledge its members’ marriage to those from other sects and made them apply for Permission to Leave Eparchy of Kottayam (PLEK). Mr. Justine, however, could secure consent for his betrothal last month in view of a recent High Court order in this regard.  The Knanaya Catholic community traces its origin back to Jewish-Christian immigrant community that migrated from southern Mesopotamia to the Malabar coast of Kodungallur in AD 345 under the leadership of merchant Thomas of Cana.  On August 29, 1911, Archeparchy of Kottayam, the only archdiocese for the Knanaya members, was formed through a Papal bull for the Knanaya community to maintain their ethnic identity. They formed an endogamous community by not allowing members to marry persons from other Christian communities.  Challenged in 1989  The practice was first challenged by Biju Uthup in 1989 when the Church refused permission for his marriage sacrament citing that Uthup’s grandmother did not belong to the Knanaya Church. The fight was eventually taken up by the Knanaya Catholic Naveekarana Samithi (KCNS), a reformation group.  On the basis of a petition filed by the KCNS on April 30, 2021, the additional subcourt in Kottayam had issued a decree of permanent injunction prohibiting termination of the membership of any person of the Knanaya archeparchy of Kottayam for marrying a Catholic from any other diocese. After an appeal against this order was dismissed by the district court, the Church approached the High Court for a stay on the judgement. A single Bench of Justice M.R. Anitha on March 10, however, declined to stay the lower court order but has agreed to hear the Kottayam archbishop’s concerns.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhpbmR1LmNvbS9uZXdzL25hdGlvbmFsL2tlcmFsYS9hLXdlZGRpbmctY291bGQtc2NyaXB0LWhpc3RvcnktZm9yLWtuYW5heWEtY2F0aG9saWMtY2h1cmNoL2FydGljbGU2Njg2MjgwMi5lY2XSAYEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHUuY29tL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uYWwva2VyYWxhL2Etd2VkZGluZy1jb3VsZC1zY3JpcHQtaGlzdG9yeS1mb3Ita25hbmF5YS1jYXRob2xpYy1jaHVyY2gvYXJ0aWNsZTY2ODYyODAyLmVjZS9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Most couples opt for Spring and early Fall weddings because temperatures are a bit more comfortable compared to the warmer or colder seasons.

That’s why many couples prefer getting married outdoors. Whether it be a private estate, a public area like a beach, or your own backyard, some cities may be a better option for an outdoor wedding.

It is no secret that the age of the AI (artificial intelligence) is upon us and is quickly spreading to all industries.  When most people think about AI, they think of the manipulation of images on social media, virtual weddings, robots taking over jobs that previously belonged to humans, etc.  However, they overlook areas and industries, like the wedding industry, for example.  Couples, who claim to not have the words to write their own wedding vows, have turned to Chatbots to generate it.

Essentially, it is a language processing tool that is driven by AI technology, which allows you to have human-like conversations and much more, using the chatbot.  The language model can answer questions and assist you with tasks, like writing an essay, coding or even write wedding vows.  A popular wedding-planning website and app, Joy, has incorporated this AI tool to assist couples with writer's block when it comes to writing vows, speeches, toasts, thank-you notes and also coming up with wedding hashtags.

Then, afterwards, they choose the style of delivery, ranging from Shakespeare, friend, therapist, TikToker, Rumi to pessimistic ex.  For wedding speeches and toasts, the same approach is taken - but, instead of highlighting what you love the most about the couple, you would give details of a memorable story about the them.  It could include how they met, or how you found out that the couple was together. Then, you choose the style of delivery.

They introduced Shamash and shared their union in an April 2021 posted stating, “We got married in January and we are very chuffed about it. For the record: this is me gushing. I am full of very positive feelings.”  During their performance in Something Special, Gadsby shared the story of their novelty wedding cake. They said that they and Shamash specifically wanted to trick a Christian bakery into making their cake. They knew that they couldn’t outright ask for it, so they had to be clever.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake, and it worked. I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10.’ Easy, so gullible, will believe anything, Christians,” Gadsby recounts.  Because the cake had to be a novelty cake to divert from the idea that it was a wedding cake, the design they went with what two otters swimming together with a giant shark about to eat them.

Well, now you can do exactly that.  ""Every year there are folks that stop by and say I've lived here my whole life and I've never been here,"" said Julia Mueller, executive director for Linden Hill Historic Estate. Her group is responsible for preserving and sharing the history of the estate in Little Falls.  On a hill overlooking the mighty Mississippi sit two mansions. A white home belonged to Drew Musser, and a green one belonged to Charles Weyerhaeuser.  In the late 1800's the two men were lumber barons and good friends. So much so that they built mansions next to each other. And that's not all they built.  MORE FINDING MINNESOTA: Iron ore and baseball celebrated at Chisholm's Minnesota Museum of Mining  ""There's a carriage house and a barn and another carriage garage,"" said Mueller.  Their families lived here happily, for decades. When the Weyerhaeusers left, they essentially gave their mansion to the Mussers. By 1989, the families were gone and both homes were vacant. But that doesn't mean they were empty.  The green mansion has been turned into a museum, and pretty much everything you see is as it was 120 years ago. In fact, 95% of the furnishings are original.  ""We actually have over 15 sets of their dishes,"" said Mueller.  Each room offers a story of its own, but the basement tends to stand-out for other reasons.  When the Mussers took over the Weyerhaeuser home, they brought over a little bit of Hollywood. The family was good friends with L. Frank Baum, who wrote ""The Wizard of Oz.""  Laura Jane Musser developed a friendship with Margaret Hamilton - the actress best known as the Wicked Witch of the West. According to Mueller, they went to Hawaii together a number of times.  A stopover next door is another step back in time. Except that the white mansion is more a hands-on experience.  ""We pretty much give you the front door keys and you have full reign of this beautiful 12,00 square foot mansion,"" said Angela Imdieke, assistant director.  Family reunions, high school reunions, and even wedding parties frequently rent out the mansion, and the music room is a popular place.  Imdieke had her wedding here. Their reception was held at the Linden Hill pavilion, which used to be the site of a heated, in-ground pool that the Weyerhaeuser's built in 1910.  There are endless books for guests to peruse. And for those that do spend the night, there's no shortage of bedrooms either - they can sleep 25 people, comfortably.  The hope is that guests develop an appreciation for the past by spending a night in the past.  ""One of our frequently-used phrases around here is 'history matters.'

Say ""I do"" on May 20. Wait! There's almost no spaces left for marriage registration that day, at any registration center across Shanghai.  520, short for May 20, has become a popular day for Chinese lovebirds to tie the knot. It's in part because it sounds similar to the Chinese phrase ""wo ai ni,"" which means ""I love you.""  Reservations opened one month prior to the date, and almost every space has been fully reserved across Shanghai.  This year's May 20 falls on Saturday, which boosted the popularity of the date.  ""We received reservations from over 100 couples for that day,"" said a staffer at the Yangpu District Marriage Registration Center. ""It marked a significant increase from regular days.""  The Songjiang District Marriage Registration Center has kept 80 slots for the day, which have been fully secured.  ""Other dates such as May 18 are also popular,"" a staffer with the Jing'an District Marriage Registration Center said. ""From now on, it's our busiest time of the year.""  Marriage registration centers said registration services are still available for those failing to secure a slot on the day, but they might need to wait a long time.  ""Every space online has been reserved, and we keep receiving a lot of inquiries from those who didn't get a slot,"" said a staffer with the Minhang District Marriage Registration Center.  ""They may have to wait a long time if they directly visit the center without a reservation, and it's not guaranteed that they'll be able to receive a certificate on the day. So we suggest they pick another date,"" the staffer added.  Getting married on an auspicious date is a long-standing tradition in Chinese culture.  On February 22, 2022, a total of 2,878 couples tied the knot across the city, far exceeding the 857 couples during that year's Valentine's Day.  In Chinese, 2 sounds ""love,"" making February 22, 2022, an extremely popular date to exchange vows.  A total of 2,567 couples tied the knot in the city on May 20, 2020, as ""May 20, 2020"" sounds similar to ""ai ni ai ni wo ai ni"" in Chinese, or ""love you, love you, I love you.""  On January 4, 2013, nearly 7,300 couples in the city said ""I do"" because the date sounds like ""forever love"" in Chinese.  On another auspicious date, October 10, 2010, local authorities registered marriages of 10,150 couples, a record high. In Chinese tradition, the number 10-10-10 symbolizes perfection.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL25ld3MvbWV0cm8vMjMwNTE3MzU5Mi_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

But whilst nothing could be said against Prince Philip's commitment to his wife and his country, his sisters did nothing to help boost his fledging reputation when he married the late Queen in 1947.  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from attending his wedding, in large part because three of them - Cecilie, Sophie and Margarita - had married German aristocrats who became leading members of the Nazi party.  Princess Sophie was even friends with Hermann Goering - the future head of Nazi Germany's air force - and had both Goering and Adolf Hitler round for tea.  Prince Philip's sister Princess Sophie is seen sitting opposite Adolf Hitler at the wedding of Hermann Goering  All of the Duke of Edinburgh's four sisters were banned from his wedding. From left to right, Princesses Sophie, Cecilie, Theodora and Margarita  Philip's real surname, Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, signified the German blood that ran through his veins.  His father, Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, was descended from the German ducal house of the same name.  Philip's mother, Princess Alice of Battenburg, also had German heritage and spent part of her childhood in the country.  The Duke of Edinburgh assumed his mother's maternal surname - Mountbatten, an Anglicised version of the German 'Battenberg' - when he married Princess Elizabeth.  After Cecilie was killed in a plane crash in 1937, a 16-year-old Philip was famously pictured at her funeral in Germany walking alongside relatives in Nazi uniforms.  She was killed along with her newborn baby in Belgium aged just 26. The aircraft's pilot had been attempting to land in thick flog.  The depiction in The Crown of the aftermath of her death was slammed by critics for wrongly suggesting that Philip was blamed by his father for her demise.  The connections between Philip's family and the Nazis - facts that in no way called the Duke's own honour into question - were explored in a Channel 4 documentary in 2014.  It revealed the contents of a memoir written by Princess Sophie in old age, in which she told of a private lunch with Hitler and how she thought he had seemed like a 'charming and seemingly modest man'.

In a sign of their devotion to Nazism, Sophie and her husband named their first son Karl Adolf, in honour of Hitler.  Sophie also wrote in her memoir of how she Goering and Hitler had both visited her home.  Goering came for tea in her flat near Frankfurt before the Nazis came to power in 1933.  She wrote: 'He talked a lot about the new political party which he had joined, the ""Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei"".  'He was very enthusiastic about it all, especially about the party leader, a man called Adolf Hitler.  'As Germany was going through hard times and there was a lot of poverty and general dissatisfaction everywhere, we were interested to hear about the great improvements his party was planning to do.'  With Goering insistent that she should meet Hitler personally, the Nazi leader then also came to her flat.  'I had been warned he was a vegetarian, and found it difficult to plan an appropriate meal,' she added.  'In those days we had a cook-housekeeper, which was just as well, as my ideas about cooking and housekeeping were fairly hazy (being only 18 at the time).  'We settled for an assortment of vegetables which turned out to be a great success.'  Sophie was careful to mention how she and her husband changed their view of Hitler 'fundamentally' later on, but said they were impressed 'by this charming and seemingly modest man, and by his plans to change and improve the situation in Germany.'

Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg  Philip as a little boy with his mother Princess Alice of Battenburg and his father Prince Andrew of Greece  Princess Theodora of Greece and Count Berthold of Baden on their wedding day in 1931  The meetings prompted her husband to join the SS, and by 1935 he had been appointed as head of the air ministry's research bureau, according to Princess Sophie.  That year, Sophie was pictured at Goering's wedding, with Hitler seen opposite.  Eight years later, Prince Christoph was killed in a plane crash in 1943, after the Allied invasion of Sicily.  Philip's oldest sister, Princess Margarita, who was 16 years older then her brother, married Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.  He was badly wounded while fighting for Germany on the Russian front and ended up turning against Hitler.  The prince was then among the aristocratic German officers who were implicated in the 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, which was led by Claus von Stauffenberg.  Cecilie had married George Donatus, the Grand Duke of Hesse in 1931 and they both later joined the Nazi party. The couple had four children.  The fourth, an unnamed son, is believed to have been born during the flight on which the 26-year-old Cecilie lost her life.  Donatus was killed alongside his wife and the plane's other passengers.  Princess Theodora, who was 15 when Philip was born in 1921, was the only one of her brother's sisters who was publicly opposed to Nazism.  Unlike her sisters, she and her husband were allowed to attend the the Queen's Coronation in 1953.  But all Philip's siblings were excluded from the royal wedding in 1947, in large part because it was so soon after the war had ended.  In an interview for 2006 book Royals and the Reich, Philip said his family had found Hitler's attempts to restore Germany's power and status 'attractive'.  'There was a great improvement in things like trains running on time and building,' he explained.  'There was a sense of hope after the depressing chaos of the Weimar Republic.  'I can understand people latching on to something or somebody who appeared to be appealing to their patriotism and trying to get things going. You can understand how attractive it was.'  But the Duke did insist that he had never been aware of 'anybody in the family actually expressing anti-Semitic views'.  Prince Philip is seen with his sister Princess Sophie (both centre) in Germany in March 1953  Prince Philip prays alongside his sister Princess Sophie and Greek Orthodox priests outside the tomb of his mother Princess Alice in 1994  The closest sibling in age to Philip was Sophie, who was born in June 1914 - seven years before her brother.  After her husband Christoph's death, she married Prince George William of Hanover, but the union was controversial.  With Prince George's house of Hanover having been the royal house of England's monarchy for more than two centuries until the death of Queen Victoria, the aristocrat sought permission from King George VI to go ahead with the engagement.  But because the UK was still at war, official permission was not given, although Sophie went on to tie the knot in 1946.  Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, wipes his eye as he sits next to his elder sister Princess Sophie in 1994 at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial  She had three further children with her second husband and passed away aged 87 in 2001, after becoming a confidante to Philip in later life.  She stayed at Birkhall with him and the Queen in the years before the Coronation and she visited Britain regularly, becoming godmother to Prince Edward.  Paying tribute to her after her death, Philip said: 'She did so much kindness in her life that she stored up many gifts in Heaven and I hope she's enjoying them now.'  Margarita died at the age of 76 in 1981, whilst Theodora was the second of Philip's sisters to pass away. She was 63 when she died in 1969.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTExNzU3OTU5L0hvdy1QcmluY2UtUGhpbGlwcy1zaXN0ZXItUHJpbmNlc3MtU29waGllLXNhdC1vcHBvc2l0ZS1ISVRMRVItSGVybWFubi1Hb2VyaW5ncy13ZWRkaW5nLmh0bWzSAZEBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTc1Nzk1OS9hbXAvSG93LVByaW5jZS1QaGlsaXBzLXNpc3Rlci1QcmluY2Vzcy1Tb3BoaWUtc2F0LW9wcG9zaXRlLUhJVExFUi1IZXJtYW5uLUdvZXJpbmdzLXdlZGRpbmcuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 06:16:53","PRESS RELEASE Published May 18, 2023 Marketers Media  The rise of virtual guest books is helping couples move towards a more modern and eco-friendly way to capture memories and animate weddings.  --  The world has seen many changes over the past three years, and the wedding industry has been no exception. With the pandemic forcing couples to postpone or cancel their weddings, many have turned to digital solutions to celebrate their special day. One such solution is the digital guest book provided by wed.tv. It allows guests to send messages and photos to the newly-weds through a simple and user-friendly interface.  Wed.tv has been in operation since 2016, but it was only during the pandemic that its popularity began to soar. The site allows guests to connect using a wedding code, which can be any unique identifier, such as the names of bride and groom. Guests can then send messages and photos via their browser, which are then displayed in a gallery that can be viewed online or projected onto a screen or TV like a slideshow. At the end of the wedding, a PDF featuring all the messages can be generated with just one click, providing a lasting memory of the event for all of the guests.  ""Before the pandemic, wed.tv had fewer than 20 guest books created per month"", said Michele Ampollini, founder of the Company. ""However, since the pandemic began, the number of people creating digital guest books has skyrocketed. By autumn 2021, almost 6,000 guest books had been opened, each receiving an average of more than 50 messages from guests. This trend shows no sign of slowing down, even after the pandemic has ended.""  There are many advantages to using a digital guest book like wed.tv:  It eliminates the need for paper, reducing waste and environmental impact.  Unlike a traditional guest book, there are no limits to the number of messages or photos that can be included.  Guests can include selfies and other photos to create a more visual and personalized record of the wedding.  The PDF created at the end of the event can be easily shared with all guests, making it an unforgettable memory for everyone.  Far from being just a digital version of the paper guestbook, Wed.tv can be used as a cutting-edge photo booth alternative and as an engaging animation tool. It's definitely an instrument without boundaries: guest books have been opened in more than 100 nations, the top users being the US, Singapore, the UK, India, Malaysia, Australia, and South Africa. Guest books are free for up to 50 guests and 250 messages, which is ideal for small weddings. Users can also purchase a premium version for larger events for as little as $29. Because of wed.tv's popularity, the founders are currently developing Guestbook.tv, a general version of wed.tv designed for occasions like birthdays, graduations, celebrations, parties, and other events.  In the words of Laurent Bedubourg, Company's CTO, ""While the pandemic may have accelerated the trend of digital weddings, it is likely that this trend will continue long after the pandemic is over. The convenience and personalization offered by digital solutions are simply too good to ignore. In addition, as people become more environmentally conscious, these platforms will become even more attractive as they eliminate the need for paper and other physical materials.""  Virtual guest books such as Wed.tv exemplify the industry's innovative response to the pandemic's constraints, allowing couples to embrace digital tools and platforms to improve their special day, and showing the adaptability and resilience of the wedding industry in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Lauryn shares four kids with husband Joshua Efirdd: Ella, 5, Bentley, 21 months, and twins Sylus and Stella, who were born last year. She also has temporary custody of June's daughter, Alana, 17.  June suggests that Lauryn bring the kids to her bridal shower -- and they can be ""one big happy family"" -- however, the latter isn't having it.  ""Mama always thinks that she can convince other people who aren't around her 24/7 that she's the best mom out there and that she's all about family and she's all about fixing her relationships,"" Lauryn explains in a confessional. ""I'm gonna tell you what, Justin's family will find out real soon when I don't show up to that bridal shower.""  After June points out to her daughter that she ""was there"" for the big events in her life, including her wedding, and baby and bridal showers and ""needs"" Lauryn to come to her shower, Lauryn says, ""Listen, Junebug. It's not always about you anymore. Okay, you gotta get that through that thick f---ing skull of yours.""  June then asks if Lauryn will let Alana go with Doe Doe to the shower, to which Lauryn replies, ""Well, here's the thing, I would have to talk to Alana and ask her if she wants to come, it's up to her.""  ""Well, I got s--- to do so I'll see about making it to your extravaganza,"" she adds, before hanging up their FaceTime call.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdG9vZmFiLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L21hbWEtanVuZXMtZGF1Z2h0ZXItcHVtcGtpbi1zbGFtcy1icmlkYWwtc2hvd2VyLWludml0ZS1zZWNvbmQtd2VkZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","1994-09-16","Not Discerned","{""Houston"", ""Texas"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 17:03:00","Anna Nicole Smith's 1994 wedding to J. Howard Marshall captivated fans — and made the icon into a punchline. But 16 years later — and the subject of a new documentary, Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me — perhaps Smith was the one telling the joke.  In 1992, Smith's extraordinary beauty launched her from small-town fried chicken server to worldwide fame, with five Playboy covers and as the face of Guess jeans. Smith then gained small parts in movies such as Naked Gun 33 1/3 and The Hudsucker Proxy. She smoldered from billboards, walked the red carpet at the Oscars and charmed late-night hosts like Johnny Carson and Arsenio Hall.  But the whole time, she was hiding a secret: she was in a relationship.  Wearing a 22-carat diamond at age 26, Smith married an 89-year-old Houston oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall in 1994. The groom, one of the richest men in America, was wheeled up the aisle behind his bride as ""Tonight I Celebrate My Love For You"" was played. Doves were released at the end in the empty chapel.  Mitchell Gerber/Corbis/VCG via Getty  ""She was adaptable to get what she needed,"" says Smith's friend Missy Byrum, who insists Smith was single-minded in her devotion to providing a good life for her son Daniel. ""But she could be herself with Mr. Marshall and that made her happy.""  Smith — who is now the subject of the Netflix documentary Anna Nicole Smith: You Don't Know Me — met Marshall while dancing at a Houston strip club in the late 1980s and went on their first date in 1991.  Byrum tells the story of their early romance this way: ""Mr. Marshall's mistress had just died. [The dancer] went and had a cosmetic procedure done that was supposed to be a routine cosmetic procedure. But it killed her for whatever reason. Lady Walker was her name.""  Byrum continues, ""Mr. Marshall was very despondent. So his driver took him into [the strip club] Legs, which is where Nicki was working at the time and she met him. She could tell that he was despondent and everything.""  Anna Nicole Smith. DMI/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock  Byrum adds, ""She would have lunch with him and stuff like that — Red Lobster — but she was trying to keep him a secret from the press after she got her cover. She couldn't disclose him to Guess or anybody at Playboy.""  Marshall, Byrum says, paid for some of Smith's surgeries. ""I believe she had already had her third boob job at this point. But Mr. Marshall paid for a fourth. They put two implants in each breast. That's why they were so big."" Eventually Marshall would buy Smith a car, diamonds and a house in Houston where she and Daniel could live.  Smith's uncle George Beall says of his niece (who was born Vickie Lynn Hogan): ""She really loved him! The way he took care of her and looked out for her. She cared about him a lot. She didn't want people to think that she was after his money. Aunt Kay and I both said to Vickie Lynn, 'If you love him, to heck with what people think!'""  Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.  Later, while she was living in Malibu with the film producer Ashley Wells Lewis, Smith would say she was being followed regularly, by people who worked for a man with whom Smith was involved.  ""It frightened her,"" Lewis says. ""She never told me who it was. She said, 'Ashley, people, they follow me everywhere I go. Dinner, my friends, they're right with me.'""  She would get home and report to Lewis, ""I lost them. I took lots of cuts and corners.""  The men were possibly working for Marshall, Byrum says, who claims she and Smith would ""hide in hotels where Mr. Marshall couldn't find us and do our crack smoking.""  Byrum — who had her own intimate relationship and informally married the pin-up in a backyard ceremony in 1993 — says Smith truly loved Marshall, but adds, ""she needed more attention than any one person could give her.""  According to Lewis, ""Anna spent her life in pursuit of happily ever after.""  Following Marshall's death at age 90 in 1995, Smith sued in Texas for $475 million, half of the late oil tycoon's estate, but lost in a September 1997 ruling that declared Pierce the sole heir, also shutting out Marshall's oldest son, J. Howard Marshall III.  The court battle took years and included a slew of mudslinging from both sides, with Smith even accusing Pierce of wanting his father dead during one heated May 1998 testimony. That summer, Smith teamed up with Marshall's disinherited older son Howard to sue Pierce, alleging that Pierce conspired for 20 years to take all of his father's fortune for himself. Partly because of complications arising from Smith filing for bankruptcy in 1996, different judges issued contrary rulings, with Smith winning $474 million, then slashing that to $88 million. The case was appealed all the way to the federal Supreme Court, which ruled in Smith's favor.  Pierce died in June 2006 at age 67 from an infection before he could successfully prosecute the case further, but his wife, Elaine, continued on behalf of his estate, even after Smith's death from an accidental overdose in 2007. In 2010, it was finally ruled that Smith's estate was not entitled to any money from Marshall's estate.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS90di9hbm5hLW5pY29sZS1zbWl0aC1qLWhvd2FyZC1tYXJzaGFsbC13ZWRkaW5nc2hlLXRydWx5LWxvdmVkLWhpbS1iZWNhdXNlLWhlLWFjY2VwdGVkLWhlci_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-17","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 16:49:24","Florida Vow Renewals, Eloping in Florida, and Florida Beach Weddings on a Budget are showcased with Suncoast Weddings Beach Wedding Packages.  This press release was orginally distributed by ReleaseWire  Treasure Island, FL -- (ReleaseWire) -- 05/17/2023 -- Planning a beach wedding offers the opportunity to weave ocean and beach-themed elements into the big day, from seashell-inspired bouquets to elements of decor. Suncoast Weddings, premier wedding planners based on the west coast of Florida, have a team of experts on hand to help guide and advise couples who are looking for creative ways to customize their beach wedding or beach vow renewal to make it unique and memorable. One of the easiest ways to customize the decor is to opt for aisle markers that are reminiscent of the beach. Good examples that are always firm favorites include white starfish, brown starfish, and conch shells. They can be mixed and matched along the aisle if preferred. The conch shells have a blush pink interior and so they are sometimes paired with a blush theme, with either blush chiffon accents on the arch and chairs, or blush chiffon drapes on the arch. A popular arch for smaller ceremonies is the signature Suncoast arch, which has two upright posts. For larger ceremonies with more guests in attendance, couples often opt for the four-post tropical arch. All of the arches, including the two-post bamboo, the four-post bamboo, and the two-post birchwood arch can be draped and decorated in a variety of ways. A crystal chandelier is a stylish addition to the arch, however, in sticking with the beach wedding theme, Suncoast Weddings also have a shell chandelier available for the main event. Shells are also featured commonly in the unity sand ceremony, where the couple pours sands from decorative shells into a heart-shaped keepsake bottle. The sand can be natural, or colored. Mixing natural sand and colored sand creates a pretty layering of the sands within the bottle, as they are poured at the same time. For ceremonies that include children, each child can also have their own shell and unique sand color on the unity sand table, so all of the sands mingle as they are poured. Another way to customize along the lines of a beach-inspired day is the bouquet and boutonniere. Seashells are popular, with a range of shapes, textures, and colors to choose from. In addition to seashells, pearls, starfish, and sand dollars can also be incorporated. Often a bouquet or boutonniere combines an element of the sea, like a seashell, with a more traditional floral component - such as an orchid with a starfish, or a lily with a seashell. The use of pale blue ribbons is another way to evoke the sea and Florida skies. Jewelry is a unique way to extend the theme to the wedding party, with starfish hair pins, seashell bracelets or anklets, and a traditional classic that takes on a new significance at a beach wedding, a pearl necklace. A fun-filled way to take the beach inspiration through to a beach wedding reception is to have a cake which is inspired by either a sandcastle, the ocean, or the beach. From corals, to bubbles, to pearls, seashells, and ombre shades of blue, there are many designs to choose from, with a gallery of inspiration on the social media profiles of Suncoast Weddings. Starfish cake toppers are a particular favorite that always makes family and friends smile. Many of these ideas to incorporate the beach or the ocean theme into a beach wedding can be done in a budget-friendly way. To discuss these ideas and explore more possibilities for a Florida beach wedding that is customized and tailored, contact the Suncoast Weddings team.  All ceremonies can be tailored with Suncoast Weddings, to individualize the decor and details. From small ceremonies for couples looking at eloping in Florida to lavish ceremonies with a hundred guests, ceremonies can be made to be unique.  Permits are required at most public beaches and should be submitted for approval as early as possible in the planning process to make sure that the location and date can be secured. Suncoast Weddings can help with the permit application process and will add the cost of the permit to the personalized proposal, as the cost varies from city to city.  Florida beach weddings and reception packages may start with a search for cheap beach wedding packages however there are many other outgoings that need to be tallied, like the dress, the travel budget, and certainly the reception. Affordable Florida beach wedding Packages typically take several elements of the ceremony and offer them at a reduced price when compared to building the wedding from scratch. This effectively 'bundles and saves' which offers the best value for money for the services delivered. Planning the wedding and reception together as part of a package helps to keep the costs totaled in one place and easier to track. A popular alternative to a traditional reception is a dinner cruise reception sailing the inland waterways around St Pete Beach, Madeira Beach, and Clearwater. This affords a great view of the dramatic and ever-changing scenery as the wedding party enjoys the reception fare. With a choice of paddleboats and sleek modern boats, couples can choose a package and location which suits their style and budget.  Treasure Island Weddings, St Pete Beach weddings, Siesta Key weddings, and Clearwater beach weddings boast spectacular sunset views over the Gulf of Mexico, perfect for couples who want sunset wedding day portraits. Florida beach weddings and reception packages can be purchased which include the ceremony and also the party to follow. This may include items such as a DJ, a custom-made cake, a coordinator for the wedding, and a professional beach wedding photographer.

More than just a symbol of love, the ring was an heirloom gifted to him by his late father.Stowarzyszenie Historyczno-Archeologiczne ""Bractwo"" /Facebook  Speaking to the local media, Kata revealed that he had spent a few weeks working as a farmhand in Germany at the start of the millennium. The gruelling nature of the work saw him shed 15 kilos, and it was this that he attributed to the loss.  “When I came back to Poland to work in the Żółwin Forest the ring must have just slipped off,” he said. “I remember delivering firewood to a friend, and when I took off my gloves afterwards the ring was no longer on my hand.”  Before the search began, Kata joked that he would like to see his ring returned.Stowarzyszenie Historyczno-Archeologiczne ""Bractwo"" /Facebook  Desperately searching the forest to recover it, Kata finally conceded defeat after eight weeks.

SISTERS star Tammy Slaton has ditched her wedding ring since striking up a romance with her new boyfriend, Greg Morgan, The U.S. Sun can exclusively reveal.  Tammy, 36, showed off her single status and got caught in new photos while out on a day trip earlier this month to Indiana with her brother Chris Combs, 41.  5 Tammy Slaton has been spotted out and about without her wedding ring Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  5 She did appear to wear some sort of band on her right hand, but has ditched her ring since her split from ex Caleb Willingham Credit: Matt Symons - Commissioned by The US Sun Digital edition  The 1000-Lb. Sisters star took a road trip away from her Kentucky home to a Sam's Club in Indiana on May 4 to stock up on groceries and supplies.  She was caught on camera without her wedding ring on her special finger; however, she was spotted wearing some sort of a band on her right hand.  The band on her right hand was visible as Tammy nervously bit her fingernails while on a grocery cart scooter headed into the Sam's Club.  When The U.S. Sun obtained photos of Tammy out on the town back in April, she was spotted wearing her wedding ring despite rumors she had already split from her ex, Caleb Willingham, 40.  The U.S. Sun confirmed the rumors of Tammy's split earlier this month.  ALREADY OVER  An insider exclusively told The U.S. Sun Tammy and her husband Caleb are officially separated and she is in the process of filing for divorce.  ""Tammy has her legal team lined up and is ready to file for divorce,"" the source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star claimed.  ""They split up because Caleb hasn't been following his diet in rehab,"" the insider alleged, adding: ""He has gained 30 lbs and hasn't been working his program.""  ""They got into a big fight over it and he told her he wanted a divorce, but then he tried to backtrack,"" the insider claimed.  Reportedly, Caleb tried to keep their marriage together after the falling out, but it was too late.  ""Tammy's sisters Amy and Amanda were already encouraging her to just move on,"" the source elaborated.  The family insider said they believed that Tammy's decision to end it with Caleb was the right thing for her.  ""She wants someone who can be there for her and his health keeps declining. She would have to take care of him once he's out of rehab, and that is her taking on the care of a whole other person when she can barely take care of herself, so the relationship is pointless,"" the insider added.  ""They got married after just knowing each other over the course of weeks, in rehab, and he's still there,"" the source continued, claiming: ""She didn't want a long-distance relationship and certainly isn't able to care for someone else at this point in her recovery.""  The insider added that Tammy's assets are protected though, and alleged Caleb signed a prenuptial agreement.  Tammy's rep and Caleb did not respond to requests for comment.  REBOUND ROMANCE  Multiple sources claim Tammy has been secretly seeing Indiana-based TikToker Greg Morgan after meeting him on a dating app.  One source close to the 1000-Lb Sisters star said: ""Tammy met Greg on one of the apps, and they immediately hit it off.""  The source added: ""They've been seeing each other for about a month now.""  ""He's come to see her a handful of times and takes a six-hour bus from Indianapolis to visit her in Kentucky,"" the insider claimed.  During one recent visit, Greg even met Tammy's family.  The source said the new couple stopped by her sister Amy's home for a visit, and Greg met her nephews Gage, 2, and Glenn, 10 months.  A second insider claimed Tammy paid for his bus rides to her town.  ""They've been talking regularly and they seem to really like each other, but they are trying to figure out when he'll visit again, because things get tough around her filming schedule,"" the second source said.  The first source added: ""Tammy is shy around him and didn't want to eat in front of him. She said she finds him very attractive.""  Greg and Tammy have also publicly communicated over TikTok, and she has commented on his page: ""Aww you love me.""  5 When Tammy was out and about last April, she was still spotted sporting her wedding band on her left hand Credit: Matt Symons for The US Sun  5 Tammy is reportedly seeking to divorce Caleb after being married for only six months Credit: Michael Moretti","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE0NDQwOC90YW1teS1zbGF0b24tc2luZ2xlLXJpbmctcGhvdG9zLWJveWZyaWVuZC1leC1jYWxlYi13aWxsaW5naGFtL9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvODE0NDQwOC90YW1teS1zbGF0b24tc2luZ2xlLXJpbmctcGhvdG9zLWJveWZyaWVuZC1leC1jYWxlYi13aWxsaW5naGFtL2FtcC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2019-11-05","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 17:11:00","The sole holdout juror in Lori Vallow Daybell’s murder trial revealed the chilling evidence that “disgusted” him in court — an experience he described as putting a “face to evil.”  Vallow Daybell, 49, was convicted last week of multiple counts of murder and conspiracy tied to the deaths of her daughter Tylee Ryan, 16, son Joshua “J.J.” Vallow, 7, and her third husband Chad Daybell’s late wife, Tammy.  In an interview with “Good Morning America” that aired Wednesday, juror Saul Hernandez said he was initially unconvinced that the Idaho prosecutors had proven Vallow Daybell’s guilt.  But just a few hours into deliberations, he was swayed by gruesome evidence that made it “harder to look at” the mom.  “Growing up, you talk about good and bad, God and evil. And I think for the first time in my life, I put a face to evil,” Hernandez said.  The juror recalled how he was “disgusted” by photos of the couple happily dancing at their beach wedding in Hawaii in early November 2019, just a few weeks after Tammy Daybell mysteriously died.  Hernandez said he “didn’t want to look at” the chilling pictures.  Saul Hernandez sat down with “Good Morning America” following last week’s verdict. ABC News / GMA  The loved-up snaps show Vallow Daybell and Chad grinning and holding hands with leis around their necks.  Investigators believe that Tylee and J.J. — who were last seen in September 2019 — were also dead by this point and had been buried in shallow graves on Chad’s Salem property, where they were found several months later.  “I just couldn’t believe how someone can be that happy when your kids are in the ground. And the person that was key in all of this is sitting across from you, smiling at you and dancing with you on the beach,” Hernandez said of the callous pair.  Hernandez said he was “disgusted” by Vallow Daybell and Chad’s wedding photos. ABC News  Throughout the proceedings, the mom’s defense team attempted to portray her as a loving and devout mother who was manipulated by Chad, a noted doomsday author.  Ultimately, however, Hernandez said he bought the prosecution’s argument that Vallow Daybell was a wannabe cultist driven by “money, power, and sex” to kill her children and conspire to help Chad murder Tammy as well.  Following seven hours of deliberation, Vallow Daybell was found guilty by the jury.  “They wanted to believe something that only applied and benefited them, only applied and benefited those people they liked, their circle that they liked and they wanted to be around,” Hernandez said of the couple’s pseudo-religious fantasies.  Lori Vallow Daybell faces the possibility of life in prison without parole. via REUTERS  He noted that he thinks Vallow Daybell’s beliefs — which included predictions of Jesus Christ’s second coming in 2020 — started as “curiosity” but became more intense “once Chad came into the picture.”  “I don’t think, as a human being, you are ever really prepared to experience this,” Hernandez said of his time on the high-profile case.  Vallow Daybell faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Tylee Ryan and J.J. Vallow were last seen in September 2019.  The killer mom barely suppressed a smug grin in her new mugshot from Madison County Jail, where she was booked after the verdict.  Meanwhile, Chad Daybell is set to be tried on a similar slew of charges at a later date.  In a statement following Vallow Daybell’s conviction, the Madison and Fremont County prosecutors said they were still “committed to pursuing justice” for the three victims.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnlwb3N0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1LzE3L2xvcmktdmFsbG93LWp1cm9yLXdhcy1kaXNndXN0ZWQtYnktZG9vbXNkYXktbW9tcy13ZWRkaW5nLXNuYXAv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly9ueXBvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTcvbG9yaS12YWxsb3ctanVyb3Itd2FzLWRpc2d1c3RlZC1ieS1kb29tc2RheS1tb21zLXdlZGRpbmctc25hcC9hbXAv?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""FollyBeach"", ""SouthCarolina"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 16:45:00","FOLLY BEACH, S.C. (WCSC) - A man involved in a Folly Beach crash on his wedding night that killed his bride and injured him and two others has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the accused driver and several Lowcountry restaurants and bars.  On April 28, Aric Hutchinson, his new bride, Samantha, and two others were traveling down Ashley Avenue on Folly Beach in a golf cart when they were hit by a gray Toyota Camry.  Police identified the driver of the vehicle as Jamie Komoroski. She has been charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury/death, according to jail records.  The newly filed lawsuit alleges Komoroski had a “booze-filled day of bar hopping” and the establishments she visited that day had an obligation to “exercise due care” in serving alcoholic beverages. In addition to Komoroski, the lawsuit names Snapper Jacks, The Drop-In Bar and Deli, The Crab Shack, Taco Boy, El Gallo Bar and Grill, and Bottle Cap Holdings, LLC.  Court documents allege Komoroski started drinking at El Gallo Bar and Grill before going to Folly Beach and visiting several bars on Center Street.  Attorney Danny Dalton answered questions Wednesday afternoon about the newly-filed suit. He said they began an investigation into the details leading up to the crash.  The husband of the newlywed killed on their wedding night on Folly Beach in a DUI crash has filed a lawsuit.  “There’s still facts and a lot of questions that haven’t been answered, which is part of the reason we wanted to file the lawsuit, was to get into the formal discovery process where we and the families can get more definite answers to some of the questions that are still a little vague to us,” he said.  Each of the named establishments “should have known that they had the authority and obligation to train, control, and supervise their respective employees, agents, or servants, including any bartenders, servers or any other employee” to not overserve patrons alcohol and not place others at risk of incurring serious injury or death, the lawsuit states.  In naming Taco Boy, the lawsuit states Komoroski had been an employee for a short time. The lawsuit alleges the restaurant was negligent by “organizing, arranging, and supervising an employee function/meeting knowing that excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages would be purchased for, served to, and/or consumed by the employees attending the function/meeting.”  “What our investigation yielded was that she had been an employee of [Taco Boy] for a short period of time, not very long, and that there was an almost routine gathering to go out to bars or a bar after their shifts or, you know, in the middle of their shifts or at different times, and their supervisors would also attend those gatherings or those events, call them what they were, and that she had attended this and that there was significant drinking at that event,” Dalton said. “And so, there’s a responsibility, especially when you have a supervisory role, but as an employer, to act responsibly in that role as employer and supervisor, and we felt that that was not done here and that it was breached.”  insert (Folly Beach Police)  Taco Boy releases statement after being named in lawsuit  Taco Boy spokesperson Melissa Reardon released a statement Wednesday afternoon on behalf of the restaurant stating that Komoroski was not in their restaurant and was not served alcohol there on the day of the fatal crash. The statement also denies there was any “organized employee function around drinking.”  Here is their full statement.  On the day of the accident, Friday, April 28, 2023, we can confirm with absolute certainty that Jamie Komoroski did not set foot in Taco Boy, nor did anyone on our team serve her alcohol at the restaurant. We have confirmed this by watching 16 hours of video footage from multiple cameras, staff interviews with everyone working that day, and by reviewing all sales receipts.  Miss Komoroski had been recently hired at Taco Boy and had trained for only two days prior to the accident. She passed her background check and there were no red flags that would indicate ineligibility for employment. She has since been terminated.  The lawsuit alleges an officially organized employee function around drinking, which we can assure there was no such thing.  We are committed to serving alcohol responsibly and take it very seriously for the safety of our staff and guests. We require that our employees ID everyone and our staff are all ServeSafe /TIPS alcohol training certified before they are allowed to serve guests. We take great care not to overserve anyone.  Our hearts are with the family and friends impacted by this tragedy. Beyond the many visitors we receive, Folly Beach is a close-knit community of locals and businesses, and we share in the heartbreak of this senseless loss.  Authorities release BAC of alleged drunk driver in crash that killed newlywed  The toxicology report from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division states that Komoroski had a blood alcohol level of 0.261% when she was tested after the April 28 crash with a golf cart on Folly Beach. That is more than three times the legal limit in South Carolina.  Along with the toxicology report, the Folly Beach Police Department also sent an updated report of the incident.  Immediately after the crash, officers asked Komoroski what happened to which she replied, “I was driving, and then all the sudden something hit me,” the report reads.  Also, in the report, multiple witness recall seeing Komoroski “dazed and confused.” At the scene, she kept asking for her boyfriend and telling the witnesses she was on her way home, the report states.  Once she saw the victims on the ground, Komoroski started screaming and asking what happened, witnesses say.  In Komoroski’s arrest affidavit, officers claim they could smell alcohol on her breath and person. She told officers she had a beer and a drink with tequila about an hour before the crash, the affidavit states.  When asked how she felt on a scale of one to ten, with one being completely sober and ten being the most impaired, she responded that she was at an eight, the affidavit states.  Komoroski was then asked to complete a field sobriety test but she refused, the affidavit states. However, her blood was sampled for the toxicology report.  Komoroski is charged with DUI causing serious bodily injury/death and reckless homicide. Police say she rear-ended a golf cart with her car in the 1200 block of East Ashley Avenue.  At the time of the crash, Komoroski was driving 65 mph, according to police.  GoFundMe raises nearly $725,000  In a May 8 update from Hutchinson’s mother, Annette, on the GoFundMe page said he was recovering at home from multiple broken bones.  “From the accident, Aric received multiple injuries including two broken legs, one which had to be surgically repaired,” Hutchinson said on May 8. “Broken bones in his face which also had to be surgically repaired. Broken vertebrae in his back, brain bleeds, and numerous cuts with stitches. He is physically recovering at home while trying to come to terms with the loss of his beautiful wife. Now he is doing the unimaginable of planning Sam’s funeral along with her family.”  The lawsuit was also filed by the other two injured in the crash.  Copyright 2023 WCSC.

But the influencer is as calm as can be ahead of the big day. In fact, Tadhg has had great fun planning his and long-time girlfriend Alannah Bradley’s nuptials.  Today's top videos  It’s helped that Alannah is just as laid back as her soon-to-be husband. Speaking to EVOKE as he does the final checks ahead of tying the knot in Kerry, Tadhg could not praise his fiancée enough.  ‘Alannah is the opposite to a bridezilla, she’s very easy going and said “whatever you like, go for it” so I’ve picked the flowers and the band. She went “that’s grand” and there’s been no stress and no panic,’ he gushed.  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  He continued: ‘It was gas actually, the girl who’s doing the flowers said to me “it’s normally the bride and not the groom calling in” but this has worked perfectly for us.  'There’s only a couple of weeks to go now but I’d say it’s butterflies more than nerves. It’s exciting but a little stressful at the same time because the list is never ending. But there’s no need to stress, you know who’s coming.'  Although Tadhg and Alannah have been together for over 10 years now, she’s very private and only makes rare appearances on his social media.  Tadhg jokes that Alannah is his ‘biggest critic as well as supporter’ when it comes to posting online and that they’ll be leaving the camera work to others at their wedding which has lots of nods to their personalities and shared love of animals.  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  ‘The dogs are a massive part of our life - we've just got a new puppy two weeks before the wedding! And Otis helped me propose, he had on a little tux and the engagement ring was in a box on him, he was my wing man, so they’ll be a big part of the day,’ Tadhg said.  He added: 'The priest told us to make sure the day was about us as well and not all about the dogs but it wouldn't be our wedding without them.'  After the church service the couple are celebrating at The Dunloe Hotel and are using lots of local suppliers and people they know for their big day. For example, Tadhg’s aunty has offered to do the canopies and coffees.  And anyone who follows Tadhg on social media knows that his dad Derry loves to get involved so it’ll come as no surprise he’s been very hands-on with the wedding planning.  Just recently a video of Derry on the kitchen floor trying to suss out the seating plan had thousands of Tadhg’s fans in stitches and anyone who’s ever tried to navigate family dynamics and feuds will relate.  Tadhg said: ‘Myself and my dad have had an input in everything. Alannah and I actually took our parents along to the food tasting with us, which was nice to have their opinions.’  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah. Pic: Supplied  When it comes to Derry’s role on the wedding day, he’ll be making a father-of-the-groom speech and Tadhg knows one thing for sure - there’s going to be tears!  Derry told us he’s not overthinking the speech and will instead: ‘Wing it and speak from the heart… but I’m an emotional person. It’s good to be in touch with your emotions.’  Tadhg Fleming and fiancée Alannah on a 78km Quest Run. Pic: Supplied  Quick to get a joke in, Tadhg quipped that Derry is a ‘one man band’ and family will have plenty of tissues on hand before teasing that they’ll have to play the Oscar music to get his dad off the stage.

Since this is wedding season around the world countless ceremonies are being celebrated as couples state their vows to honor, love, and cherish their intended. It is the hope of most couples that these most important of important moments be witnessed by those who have made the biggest impression on their lives.  For those who have a parent that has passed away, the wedding day can be bittersweet. While the joy of a new union fills the air, there is a sense of melancholy that persists because of those that are missing. But, are those dearly departed truly gone?  Jen Theodore via Unsplash Jen Theodore via Unsplash loading...  A Tik Tok video posted by the husband and wife photography team at Danleigh Videography may have given us visual proof that those who love us from beyond the grave are still very much a part of our lives.  In the video shared on the Tik Tok social platform, you can see and hear the mother of the bride reflecting and lamenting the sadness that the bride's father could not walk her down the aisle. Then, ""Dad"" makes his presence known.  In Louisiana, we would call that kind of moment a frisson moment. The kind of moment that gives us chills. But not cold chills, the kind of chills that warm us up from the inside.  As the Mother of the Bride was speaking of her late husband and the bride's father you can hear the sound of a random candle breaking. Some might call that a coincidence. Others, myself included, call that unconditional love. The kind of love that a father has for his children. The kind of love that can't be contained by death.

This season, Queen Charlotte stole the show with her individualistic personality and her royal bridal look, which, to date, is the most sumptuous Bridgerton wedding gown we've ever seen.  The specific dress in question? A long-sleeve, corseted pale gold ball gown with light blue and gold embroidery, complete with a sparkling removable blue cape. In fact, Queen Charlotte's wedding dress has made such a splash that the creators of Bridgerton, in collaboration with Allure Bridals, are set to release a collection inspired by the fictional character herself.  Courtesy of Allure Bridals  Working alongside Lyn Paolo, the Emmy-winning costume designer for Bridgerton, the collection draws inspiration from the show's ""opulent aesthetic and the bold, regal fashions of the character of Queen Charlotte,"" and ""will showcase a stunning array of bridal gowns, each capturing the essence of Shondaland’s series with intricate lace details, luxurious fabrics, and exquisite embellishments,"" as noted in a press release by Allure Bridals.

"wedding","2023-05-12","Not Discerned","{""SantaMonica"", ""California"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:10:00","For many couples, what they'll wear on the actual wedding is usually the only fashion consideration they make when planning their upcoming nuptials. And while selecting a ceremony gown and tuxedo is an extremely important task, for those who are currently planning multiple events, there are several other outfits you need to consider. From what you'll wear to the engagement party and the rehearsal dinner to outfits for the bachelor or bachelorette party and post-wedding brunch, your complete wedding wardrobe is an opportunity to showcase your personal style and create a cohesive look from start to finish.  With all this in mind, it's normal to feel a lot of pressure when attempting to curate the ""perfect"" capsule wardrobe. Not only will you need to coordinate with your partner, but you also have to consider your personal aesthetics, each event's theme, where they'll be held, and the level of formality, among other things. Before you get completely overwhelmed, though, we'd like to highlight that these supplementary outfits provide you with the freedom to test out new fashions and reflect your status as the bride or groom. It's also your chance to incorporate pops of color, seasonal fabrics, or trending accessories that may not be suitable for your actual nuptials. Sounds fun, right?  Ahead, we spoke with two stylists for their expert advice on planning the ultimate wedding wardrobe. Here's everything you need to know, from when to buy your outfits to styling tips to remember.  Meet the Expert Hope LaVine is a bridal stylist based in Santa Monica, California. She’s also a content creator that provides brides with wedding inspiration and advice via her TikToks, quizzes, and Pinterest boards.  Raina Silberstein is a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper based in Los Angeles, California. She helps clients define their personal style and build a wardrobe for work, special events, and more.  PHOTOS BY ADRIANA RIVERA and REBECCA YALE PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Consider When Planning Your Wedding Wardrobe  Before you start shopping for your wedding wardrobe, both Rania Silberstein, a fashion stylist and luxury personal shopper, and Hope LaVine, a bridal stylist, recommend deciding on an overall creative vision. That way, you can select outfits that complement the vibe of your events while also taking the season, level of formality, and event design into consideration. For instance, if you’re planning a party on the beach, “an overall relaxed style may be best,"" Silberstein says. ""Opt for lightweight textiles like a linen suit or take cues from the coastal color palette. Planning a downtown city celebration? Neutrals and shine make a chic formula along with sleek silhouettes that mirror the architecture.”  Silberstein also advises couples to use their personal style and everyday wardrobe as inspiration. “If you often choose bold styles in your wardrobe, forgo traditional options like a white gown or black tuxedo,” she explains. “I would avoid trying something entirely new and out of your personal comfort level, whether that is a color, pattern, texture, or silhouette.” That’s not to say you can’t experiment with your ensembles, but the key to creating a fantastic look is by bringing together fashion elements you already love with a few statement details.  Lastly, you’ll want to think about wearability. “I would want to invest in high quality, gorgeous pieces that I would wear in new ways,” LaVine says. “I think your wedding wardrobe should be pretty interchangeable—a corset you wore for your bachelorette, then wear on a Friday date night with the spouse. I think if we invest in better quality pieces up front, then we will have it in our closet forever.”  PHOTO BY ADRIANA RIVERA; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  When to Buy Your Wedding Wardrobe  While it’s highly recommended that you buy a wedding dress or suit several months before the big day, the shopping timeline for your other celebrations isn't as restrictive. Specifically, Silberstein suggests that couples purchase their outfits in the same season as their events. “By sourcing your outfit closer to the event date, you discover relevant styles, colors, and textiles for the time of year,” she notes. “Resort styles may appeal for your summer tropical welcome party, while rich velvets are beautiful for a winter engagement event.”  She further notes that everyone should book their venue spaces before deciding on their outfits, as the location “will set the tone for the entire event from the design elements to the overall vibe. The wedding attire should complement the vision too.” Finally, once you’ve secured dates for your events, Silberstein and LaVine both recommend finalizing your outfit about two to three weeks beforehand to allow for any potential outfit changes, alternations, and delayed shipping.  For the bride, LaVine suggests purchasing a wedding gown first before you focus on anything else. “After that, I like to switch back to more ‘high stakes’ looks like rehearsal dinner and reception (if there is a dress change),” she says. “After securing those outfits, I tend to prioritize the bachelorette party looks last. They’re a little easier to buy for and have tons of options out there.” As for the groom, LaVine recommends that his look should not only compliment the event's aesthetic but should also pair well with the bride's attire—meaning, the groom should purchase his outfits once everything else has been locked in.  How to Make Your Wedding Wardrobes Cohesive  A bride’s look tends to take top priority for most wedding events, but it’s important to put some thought into the groom’s pieces as well. Though being matchy-matchy isn’t the right choice for every couple, planning out looks together prevents any potential clashes and ensures complementary styles—this is especially important when you consider how highly photographed all of these events will be. According to Silberstein, you should start by selecting adjectives that best describe your desired aesthetic to help guide your wardrobe choices. For example, “If the special day is supposed to be fresh, bold, and relaxed, a whimsical floral dress and vibrant suit may be favorable,” she says. “By following this unofficial dress code, the partners guarantee a cohesive, personalized, and special event wardrobe.”  LaVine also suggests couples adhere to the same level of formality, whether that’s black-tie or casual, and a similar color scheme. “When wearing white to the wedding events, you really want to match your whites down to the tone—cool white, warm white, or neutral white. And if the bride is in ivory, we definitely don’t want the groom in white or anything drastically different,” she explains. ""Pastels tend to be more casual, and jewel tones [feel] dressier. Neutrals work both ways, but it depends on the styling.” Aside from color, the experts go even further to share their top style suggestions for each event, as highlighted below.  For the Engagement Party  There’s no better way to show off your new relationship status than with an engagement party. Since this is the first of many wedding-related celebrations, LaVine suggests that brides keep their styles relaxed and playful. “I love a fun midi dress for a bride. It’s somewhere in between sophisticated and fun. Maybe the trim of the skirt has feathers, or the straps have pearls. For styling, you could also go with a fun shoe if your dress leans more simple,” she says. As for the groom, the stylist recommends going for an equally sophisticated look, like “a well-tailored black trouser, nice t-shirt or polo, and a loafer.” And to tie both looks together, the groom should consider matching his shirt with the color of the bride's dress or shoes.  For the Bridal Shower  Bridal showers are typically daytime events, which means a light color palette, textured fabrics, and romantic silhouettes are all appropriate sartorial choices. Silberstein says, “If the bride is attending a tea party event hosted by her family and friends, a white long-sleeve lace midi dress with nude ankle strap heels would be an elegant choice.” In this case, she also recommends advising guests to wear pastel hues to guarantee great photos and a cohesive theme. As for accessories, “This would be such a special day to wear family heirloom pieces or something of sentimental value. Especially with all of your family around you,” she adds.  Though a groom’s appearance may be brief at this event, he should still dress in a complementary outfit. A button-down shirt and dress pants, in a similar color scheme or texture as the bride’s ensemble, would be perfect for this occasion.  PHOTOS BY KT MERRY AND LAUREN FAIR PHOTOGRAPHY; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  For the Bachelor and Bachelorette Parties  Whether you’re having a joint celebration or separate events, get creative with your bachelor and bachelorette party ensembles. “This is such a great time to play around with different styles and types of looks,” LaVine notes. “For my brides, I love seeing some different pieces like a blazer dress, a jumpsuit, or a two-piece set. We can get super creative here and have fun.” She also notes that brides can include at least one statement piece, like ""a fun heel wrap-up, feathers, or bows.” For the groom, LaVine recommends trying out different fabrics, opting for linen pants over jeans, or a leather jacket instead of a blazer. “Obviously, grooms don’t typically try and wear white their whole bachelor trip, but you can still stand out with something fun, like a floral or a chic neutral-on-neutral look,” she says. “Cream jeans and a cream t-shirt make for a very versatile outfit that can be worn for any bachelor trip moment.”  Planning a themed night out? Add some playful corresponding details to your look. For instance, if you’re hosting a bachelorette weekend in Nashville, Silberstein says, “The bride can wear a white denim jacket and white denim mini skirt, set along with white cowboy boots to walk down Broadway in style.""  For the Welcome Party  If you’re planning a wedding outside of your city, it’s common practice to host a welcome party for your guests. And since this is the first time you can really shine a light on your bridal and groom fashions, stick to silhouettes and color palettes that complement your venue or event theme. What's more, LaVine advises couples to embrace a casual dress code, as a welcome party is “a raw, stripped-down time to just show the couple and their love.”  She loves the idea of a bride in a maxi gown paired with a soft beauty look and the groom in a coordinating outfit, which may include a “quality khaki or cream pant and white button down, slightly unbuttoned, with a beautiful brown loafer.” Remember to be mindful of the season, though, as some colder months may call for longer hemlines and thicker fabrics.  For the Rehearsal Dinner  The rehearsal dinner is another opportunity to preview your wedding aesthetics. “This night is truly connected to the next day, so I like to incorporate small elements of the bridal look into the wedding look,” LaVine says. “For example, if your bridal gown has lace on it, it would be really interesting to have a simple gown and add a touch of lace through a glove or long sleeve.” She also suggests that brides opt for an “effortless, yet put together” outfit that perfectly blends their bridal status with their personal style. Some elegant options include a floor-length gown, an embellished midi dress, or a satin jumpsuit.  Although the bride commonly wears white on this night, there's no reason why the groom can't consider a more colorful look. Whether that’s adding a navy jacket on top of a white button-down or donning a jewel-tone suit, the bolder color scheme will make a bride’s white ensemble pop even more. As for accessories, LaVine says that the groom can keep it simple, opting for no tie, no vest, and leaving the top few buttons of his shirt open for a formal yet relaxed look.  For the Farewell Brunch  After a late night of celebrating their nuptials, many couples will prefer a slightly more casual dress code at their post-wedding brunch. While the attire for this event can vary, you’ll want to prioritize comfort and opt for a look that's functional yet stylish. “For my brides, I always recommend comfort here! Whether that’s a chic bridal short and lace top, a jumpsuit, or a silk flow slip dress,” LaVine says. For the groom, attire suggestions also fall into the relaxed category. She suggests “a linen pant and button down, or floral or lace fun shirt with a quality jean” for a simple look that still feels wedding-worthy.  Additionally, Silberstein recommends that couples “begin their marriage in a matching monochrome color palette.” White or neutrals are typically the favored option, but consider incorporating a seasonal color into both of your outfits for a statement look that's still cohesive. Jewel-tone hues, like dark purple, burgundy, or forest green, are excellent choices for a fall or winter event, while spring and summer call for pastel colors like light pink, sky blue, or yellow.

Dottie Fideli was one of those girls and has been dreaming of her ultimate wedding day her entire life.  Now at age 77 she's said 'sod it' to waiting around for a man and has married herself in the ultimate act of self-love at her Ohio retirement home.  Speaking to NBC local affiliate WLWT5, the grandmother revealed she finally had the chance to have the wedding she had always dreamed of.

Advert 10  Ms Fideli had been married once before, back in 1965.  But the ill-fated nuptials were never meant to be.  After she and her ex-husband exchanged vows at a courthouse, 'he went to work and I went home'.  ""I wore a black dress, so I was doomed before I got started,"" she revealed.  Advert 10  But she had always dreamed of having her own 'big wedding', but was dismayed at the idea it was 'too late' for her.  Her daughter, Donna Pennington, was determined to make her mother's dreams come true.  They set about decorating the community room of O’Bannon Terrace Retirement Home in Goshen, Ohio, with balloons and her daughter cooked all of the food.  Family, friends, and loved ones turned out to see Fideli in her dream white dress with sheer long sleeves and a silver belt.  Advert 10  She also wore a white veil with an embellished headband.

But, when the sun set on her dream wedding day, she ended up 'really happy' after marrying herself.  Advert 10  In her hand as she said her vows to herself, she held a white lily as a symbol for self-love.  ""I said, 'Everybody takes this outside lily. And they live their life and they think they’re happy and everything’s going to be hunky-dory, but they don’t consider the inside, the little petals inside',"" she told Today.  ""The inside is what’s important. That’s where God’s love flows. That’s where he gives you wisdom and he gives you hope. And nobody ever takes time to think about that.""  She added: ""So that’s what I’ve done, and I’d appreciate it if all of you people would do it and think of it that way.""

Photo by Valorie Darling; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  As Soon as Possible: Get Your Ring Resized  Before we dive into the specifics, if your wedding rings don't fit your finger the way you'd like, be sure to have them resized as soon as possible. “I would recommend having your ring resized right away, whether it's too big or small,” says Ahn-Lee. What's more, while weight loss shouldn't be a priority on your to-do list, Ahn-Lee further notes that “for couples who lose weight before the wedding day, I would recommend resizing the wedding bands to fit a few weeks before the wedding day so there isn't a significant change to ring size.”  One Year Out: Establish Your Budget  When establishing a comprehensive wedding budget, make sure you account for your wedding bands—while they're not as pricey of a line item as catering, for example, knowing how much you have to spend allows you to better consider your options. “Your wedding jewelry is usually part of your wedding budget, so it is also helpful to know how much you plan on spending,” explains Ahn-Lee. “You'll also need time to research and plan your [pieces] if you are doing any custom jewelry work.” Start saving photos of ring stacks and individual bands you like in order to share them with your partner and jeweler when shopping.  Planning on wearing earrings, a bracelet, or a necklace alongside your bands? Consider whether you want to purchase those items, or if you’re borrowing them from family members, and include that in your budget. And if those borrowed items need to be cleaned, bring them along on your next trip to the jeweler.  Six Months Out: Take Your Engagement Ring in for a Checkup  About six months before you say ""I do,"" visit your jeweler for a quick ring checkup. This is also a great time to ask questions about how to best care for your rock while at home. “General knowledge on how to care for and protect your jewelry will help maintain its beauty,” says Ahn-Lee. Lastly, while we highly recommend this step ahead of the wedding, you should continue to get your ring examined on a regular basis and add it to your routine for years to come. “A half-yearly to yearly checkup is also recommended to ensure the stones are secure and prongs, links, clasps, and settings are in good condition,"" Ahn-Lee adds.    Photo by Rachel Rodgers Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Three to Four Months Out: Buy Your Wedding Bands  It's generally recommended that you choose your wedding bands at least three to four months before the wedding, and Schatner adds that couples should buy their bands no later than one month before the big day. When selecting your bands, make it a day-long event with your partner and schedule time to grab breakfast or lunch, then head to the jeweler to try on those all-important pieces. As for who picks up the tab for the rings? That all depends! If you want to purchase your partner’s band and they yours, that's great, but it’s certainly not a requirement. “Since wedding bands are generally part of the wedding budget, the couple can discuss how they want to purchase them,” explains Ahn-Lee. “There is no right or wrong way on who should be buying them.”  Finally, once your rings are ready, Schatner advises couples to pick them up together so the jeweler can make sure they're a perfect fit. “If an alteration needs to be made, you can leave it with the jeweler, saving yourself time and an extra trip.”  About a Week Out: Get Your Rings Cleaned  “It’s ideal to get your rings cleaned as close to the day of the wedding as possible, so they are at their sparkling best for your special day,” says Schatner. “Your jeweler is happy to clean your rings for you, and when we clean them we also check for loose stones or lifted prongs.” If you're having them cleaned a week out, you may want to store your jewelry in a ring box rather than wear it; if going a week without your precious rock feels unimaginable, be sure to remove it whenever cooking, cleaning, working out, or applying makeup, sunscreen, or moisturizer, thus ensuring it remains clean and shiny ahead of the wedding. If you're nervous about keeping it pristine, see if your jeweler can send you home with a convenient cleaning pen for on-the-spot touchups or else try to squeeze in a cleaning appointment closer to the wedding date.  Photo by Leah Marie Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  What to Avoid  In the lead-up to your wedding day, it's important to be extra careful with your jewelry, and when in doubt, take it off. “To protect their jewelry and reduce the risk of damage before the wedding day, a couple should avoid impact on hard surfaces, gripping items with force, or applying strong pressure to jewelry or hands when jewelry is worn, such as when working out or performing physical labor,” shares Ahn-Lee. “Avoid harsh chemicals such as chlorine and household bleach and everyday substances such as lotion, hairspray, and perfume.”  If you’re concerned about potentially damaging your band or stone before the big day, consider taking your ring off as soon as you get home. Keep a small dish near the sink so you remember to remove it when washing dishes, and designate a spot in the bathroom and bedroom so your precious jewels are in a secure place when you’re not wearing them.

"wedding","2023-10-05","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","Wed 17 May 2023 14:00:00","Expand Autoplay Image 1 of 5 Cappella Romana’s “A Ukrainian Wedding” Ukrainian weddings feature decorated tree branches. (Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky/Photo by Nadia Tarnawsky)  The war in Ukraine has made its culture more precious than ever, especially traditions that might become lost after the smoke clears. One of Ukraine’s unique cultural gems involves the music and customs that accompany a traditional wedding. You can hear these evocative songs in “A Ukrainian Wedding,” which will be performed by the women of Cappella Romana with guest Ukrainian singers.  The program is curated by Nadia Tarnawsky, a professional singer and folklorist who gives workshops on Ukrainian music throughout the nation.  “I grew up speaking Ukrainian as a first language,” said Tarnawsky, “My father came to Cleveland, Ohio during World War II, and my mother was born in the U.S. Her family came here from Ukraine in the late Nineteenth Century with the first wave of immigrants.”  HERE IS OREGON: HereisOregon.com | Instagram | YouTube | Facebook | Twitter | TikTok  Tarnawsky has a bachelors in music education from Case Western Reserve University, where she has also pursued a masters in ethnomusicology. From 2017 to 2018, she spent 10 months in Ukraine on a Fulbright Scholarship to study its folk music and traditions.  During that time, Tarnawsky traveled with Inna Kovtun, artistic director of the Kyiv-based ensemble Rozhanytsia, to villages where they learned and recorded songs. Since the war started in Ukraine last year, Kovtun has moved to Portland with her daughter. Her husband remains in Ukraine.  “It is important to get these songs,” said Kovtun. “There aren’t that many people who remember all of the verses. Now there are even fewer people because of the war. Nadia and I just listened to them. These are old songs, but I can learn the melody after hearing it one time. The music speaks to my soul.”  Because most of the wedding music is sung by the women of the villages, the concert will feature the women of Cappella Romana plus Tarnawsky, Kovtun, and Hanna Tischenko, who is also a professional folk singer from Ukraine now living as a refugee in Chicago.  The Cappella Romana program draws from wedding folk songs that are not from a particular region of Ukraine, but from all around the country.  “In general, wedding music has specific songs that happen at specific times,” said Tarnawsky. “When the matchmakers come to your house, there’s a song that you sing. When you make the wedding bread called the korovai. It is a yeasty bread, and they did it on ‘The Great British Baking Show.’ You sing about what goes in the bread and how you make it. There are songs about dressing the bride and groom. There is a song about the girl on her last night as an unmarried woman. Songs about making the wreaths that go on their heads. Songs about what to expect when the bride moves into the man’s household, which meant living with the mother-in-law and father-in-law.”  “Weddings are held on Sundays,” added Tarnawsky. “On Mondays the bride’s friends would have farewell breakfast with her and sing these lamentations. There would be songs about how she is not a member of their group anymore. Sometimes she would have to leave the village, and they wouldn’t see her again.”  The second half of the program features music that is usually sung during the wedding ceremony.  “Although the church wedding music is not exactly folk in style,” explained Tarnawsky, “I opted to use compositions from composers who were inspired by folk traditions, along with widely known Kyivan chant versions, and pieces which use the liturgical tones. They will be in a more standard, Slavic style.”  Tarnawsky also mentioned that there are other songs that are sung after the wedding, but those songs won’t be part of the concert.  “Some songs have a lot of double-entendre meanings and are racy,” explained Tarnawsky, “And there are a number of songs that remind me of Appalachian murder ballads. They are kind of dark in a similar way.”  But she did talk about one folk song that is done at every wedding.  “It’s a song about two doves that love each other very much,” said Tarnawsky. “They have a nest on the side of a mountain. An eagle comes in and kills the male dove and scoops up the female. He takes the female home where he has a whole bunch of doves in cages. He gives her plenty of food and water, but she is unhappy. She just wants to weep and return to the mountain to the place where she was with the male dove. He offers her other male doves, but she rejects them, complaining that their down is not right, and they don’t have the right voice when they coo.”  “I thought that it was a depressing song,” continued Tarnawsky, “and I asked why is it sung as part of a wedding. A sweet grandmother replied ‘Look at how true her love is. She will love him forever even when he is no longer there. Why wouldn’t you sing this at a wedding.’”  That song, unfortunately, has even more meaning in light of the current situation in Ukraine.  8 p.m. Saturday, May 20, St. Mary’s Cathedral, 1739 N.W.

"wedding","2023-06-01","Not Discerned","{""Amman"", ""Amman"", ""Jordan""}","Wed 17 May 2023 15:01:25","The Jordanian royal family has already had a busy year of celebrating, with Queen Rania and King Abdullah II’s oldest daughter, Princess Iman, marrying Jameel Thermiotis on March 12, 2023. Now, the group is preparing for another royal wedding: Crown Prince Hussein’s nuptials to Rajwa Al-Saif, which is expected to take place on June 1, 2023. In the latest update on May 15, 2023, The Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman revealed the expected wedding dress code, and it appears to ditch one key accessory that epitomizes royalty. When a fan asked about the attire for the affair via Twitter, Salman responded, “More like black tie, long dress but no tiaras.” The royal blogger never clarified whether the “no tiara” rule applies to the bride, however.  Handout / Getty Images  The Twitter thread began with Salman confirming that Queen Azizah of Malaysia and her husband, King Abdullah, will attend the crown prince’s wedding. Many other royals around the world will also make an appearance. According to Hello!, the guest list will include Princess Hisakoa and Princess Tsuguko of Japan, Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.  On May 14, 2023, the Royal Hashemite Court revealed the official logo for Hussein’s big day, which is an Arabic symbol topped with a crown. “As the date of the wedding of HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif nears, we are pleased to share the official logo to mark the occasion, which is Arabic for ‘we rejoice,’” the court tweeted, along with a clip of the graphic. The post even mentioned a hashtag for the special day, which is #CelebratingAlHussein.  The Royal Hashemite Court first announced the crown prince’s wedding date back in December of 2022, but the entity has kept many of the other details a secret. ""The Royal Hashemite Court is pleased to announce that the wedding of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II and Miss Rajwa Khalid Al Saif will take place on June 1, 2023,” the court released in a statement. “The Royal Hashemite Court extends its sincere congratulations to Their Majesties King Abdullah II and Queen Rania Al Abdullah on this occasion and wishes His Royal Highness Crown Prince Al Hussein bun Abdullah II and Miss Raja Khalid Al Said a lifetime of happiness #Jordan.”  To share the news, the royal court shared a photo of the couple posing together, with the bride-to-be in a white dress with puff sleeves and the future groom in a dark suit. The day is a special one for the future newlyweds because Hussein’s parents, Queen Rania and King Abdullah II, will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary a little over a week later, on June 10, 2023, Tatler reports.  The couple first announced their engagement on August 18, 2022. “We pray that God grants us His blessings,” Hussein wrote on his Instagram account. “Grateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes.” The future king of Jordan also uploaded a snap of himself and his soon-to-be wife, and her diamond ring is on full display in the photo. According to Tatler, Hussein popped the question at Rajwa’s father’s home, and his parents were also present to witness the proposal. Queen Rania commented on the Instagram post, “I didn’t think it was possible to hold so much joy in my heart! Congratulations to my eldest Prince Hussein and his beautiful bride-to-be, Rajwa.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vY3Jvd24tcHJpbmNlLWh1c3NlaW4tcm95YWwtd2VkZGluZy1kcmVzcy1jb2RlLTc0OTkzNjTSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They were most of a continent away in the Bahamas, thanks to the university’s marine ecology program, studying sea stars. The proposal eight years later happened in an altogether different climate, though: on a mountaintop in Colorado.  The details: “Austin and I care very deeply about the natural world, so it was incredibly important to us that our wedding paid homage to nature,” Laura says. “Before our public ceremony, we hiked the trails on our venue's property—me, barefoot, of course—just the two of us and our photographer. About a half-mile back in the woods is a gorgeous waterfall, where we had a private vow reading ceremony. It was so special and intimate and beautiful.” She describes their wedding as an earthy, wildflower party in the woods. To that end, guests took home wildflower seed packets from American Meadows as their favors.  Of note: All of the key songs of the day were by musicians that the couple had seen live. This included Billy Strings’ “Love Like Me” and Trampled By Turtles’ “Alone” (processional), “See the World” by Caamp (recessional) and “The Mountain Song” by Rayland Baxter (first dance).

Laura Palacios was shooting the couple’s big day and toward the end, the bride and groom wanted to jump into the pool. About five minutes after, Palacios noticed people searching the pool floor.  “I asked, ‘Did you lose something?’ My gut was saying it was the ring,” Palacios tells Newsweek. “The bride, Courtney, put her hand on the side of the pool for me to see. The ring was there. The diamond was gone. She was as calm and happy as she had been all day.”  Despite the bride’s calmness over the situation, wedding guests were frantically searching for the missing gem — that’s when Palacios had her brilliant idea.  “I looked back through images and realized it had gone missing at some point on the dance floor,” says the wedding shooter.  Her ingenuity meant that the group quickly ascertained they were looking in the wrong place, Palacios’s pictures confirmed that the diamond had gone missing long before the couple jumped in the pool.  “I would have jumped in the pool to help them look, but I wanted to be sure we weren’t wasting time looking in the wrong place,” adds Palacios.  The dance floor actually had wooden slats but amazingly the diamond was so big that it had become wedged in a gap.  “It was a miracle,” Palacios adds. She posted another video of the moment the precious jewel was recovered by a staff member who returned it to the grateful bride and groom.  More of Palacios’s work can be viewed on her website, TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram.

Janet Towers, a resident of Colten Care’s Belmore Lodge in Lymington, is no longer able to travel.  Her greatest wish recently had been to see her son John get married to his partner Sarah-Jane.  The New Forest care home secretly transformed Janet’s room into a beautiful wedding chapel – enabling her to see her son exchange vows with his fiancée.  Janie Wilkins, home manager of Belmore Lodge said: “When we learned that Janet may have to miss the wedding, we knew that simply wouldn’t do.  “So, we told a little fib and asked Janet if we could dress her room for a marketing promotion, to show how we can accommodate special occasions.  “Janet agreed and this gave us the opportunity to transform her room and of course dress her accordingly as the beautiful mother of the groom.  “One significant detail was left out though, and that was that we would be re-creating John’s upcoming wedding.”  Bournemouth Echo: Janet Towers with her son John.

Everyone then enjoyed cake and toasted the newlyweds with pink fizz.  An emotional Janet said: “I had no idea this was going to happen, but I can’t thank everyone enough.  “I didn’t think I would be able to be part of John and Sarah-Jane’s wedding, but I was, and I loved every single moment of it. Thank you so much to everyone who made my wish possible.”  Janet’s son John added: “My wife and I are extremely grateful to Janie and all the staff at Belmore Lodge who made our special day so memorable.

"wedding","2023-05-06","10:00:00","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 13:02:05","Choosing your wedding hairstyle is a task that seems like it should be simple, but most brides-to-be would agree that it can be surprisingly difficult to navigate. After all, this is going to be one of the most photographed days of your entire life, so your final look will be on full display for years to come. In addition to considering which type of hairstyle will best suit your wedding style, location, and dress, you'll also need to think about how you envision yourself as bride: Do you want your hair styled into soft, romantic waves that skim across your back, or do you prefer the look of a polish, elegant updo?  As it turns out, you don't need to choose just one hairstyle for your big day. According to hairstylist Jill Buck, the creative behind Hayley Erbert's two stunning cover story hairstyles, a mid-party swap is not only entirely feasible, but it's actually easy to achieve if your pro has prepped your hair properly. Here, she shares her tips for long-lasting nuptial hairstyles and advice on how to change up your look during the wedding.  For soft waves that last all day, start with the right base.  Buck stresses the importance of ensuring that your hairdresser has enough time to prep your hair; ask how long they'd need in an ideal world and build your morning-of timeline around that. ""For brides, I like to really take time in the prep of the hair. It needs to last all day and often there isn’t time to reset any curls on such a busy day,"" she says. ""I start on wet hair with Joico’s K-Pak Luster Lock Spray (for heat protection) and then Joi Whip Design Foam (for structure and hold)."" Then, she gives the hair a ""nice, full blowout"" and curls the entire head using a 1 1/4"" curling iron (Buck likes the T3 Micro). ""Using the bigger iron helps the waves to be a little softer than a traditional Hollywood glam look,"" she explains.  Hayley's soft waves require two additional steps: For that soft, touchable look, Buck says she finishes the curls with a Mason Pierson boar bristle brush and locks the shape in place with Joico’s JoiMist hairspray.    Be sure to choose your most flattering side for a part.  If there's one piece of advice Buck wants to give all brides-to-be, it's that you should over-communicate your preferred ""side"" so that your stylist can part your hair accordingly. ""There is nothing more frustrating than setting a look only to find you have to switch the part!"" she says. Plus, you wouldn't want to end up with a hairstyle that doesn't feel like ""you,"" and parting your hair in a way you've never done before almost always ends in that result.  And don't forget to consider what best suits your wedding dress.  Another pro tip from Buck? During your hair trial, be sure to show your hairstylist a photo of your wedding dress. ""The dress neckline is always my starting point, too,"" she explains. ""You don’t want the hair and dress in competition; they should complement one another.""  If the hair was properly set, changing to an updo should be a breeze.  The beauty of Buck's method? Taking the hair from soft, flowing waves into a structured updo is an extremely straightforward process. ""After my initial set the hair is in perfect condition to put into an updo. I don’t like to use an iron after hairspray so your brush is going to be the best tool for changing the shape,"" she explains. How did she bring Hayley's look up in a flash? ""On a sleek center part I brushed her hair into two ponytails one on top of the other. This helps give me control of how sleek I can get it as well as a good anchor to set the updo and place the Bobby pins. Mini rubber bands, different Bobby pin sizes, and firm hairspray are all good tools to have.""  And if you want to go the other direction? Just be clear about your plans during your first hair trial. It's certainly not impossible to go from an updo to a long, loose hairstyle, but you'll likely need to do some touchups once pins and rubber bands come out, and your stylist may want to use a softer, more flexible hairspray on your initial updo than they otherwise would.  Decide if going from hair down to an updo—or vice versa—makes the most sense for your day.  According to Buck, brides tend to choose updos for more formal events or for the more traditional portion of the day, so most women prefer to star with their hair up and then bring it down. That being said, there's a real benefit to going in the other direction: By the time the party starts and you're ready to dance, having your hair up and out of your face might be exactly what you want. You'll have taken your beautiful portraits with long, flowing hair, and now you can stay cool and look fresh throughout the party.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vaG93LXJlY3JlYXRlLWhheWxleS1lcmJlcnQtY292ZXItaGFpci03MjU1NjM50gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The team behind the Fox first responder drama filmed so many Tarlos wedding scenes that some had to be left out of the final cut of Tuesday's two-hour season 4 finale. But now one of those moments is seeing the light of day, with EW exclusively revealing TK (Ronen Rubinstein) and Carlos (Rafael Silva) cutting their wedding cake.  ""I want a divorce!"" TK ends the clip, after Carlos smooshes a slice all over his face. ""An annulment's cheaper,"" Carlos' ex-wife, Iris (Lyndsy Fonseca), chimes in from the sidelines.  But despite all the sorrow throughout the finale, Silva says filming the wedding ""felt like bliss, it felt like joy, and it felt like love. Everyone was in happy mode. It's a wedding, and we have the entire cast there, so it's a f---ing blast. Everyone's loud, everyone's laughing, and it's a lot of fun.""  ""It was a celebration of also wrapping the season,"" adds Rubinstein, ""closing another chapter on this tremendous journey that we're on. It was a beautiful culmination.""  Now looking forward to season 5, the two actors have a few ideas on where their characters go from here now that they're married. Silva is excited to explore what Gabriel's death does to Carlos, while Rubinstein hopes to see his character interact more with his ""firehouse mom,"" Tommy (Gina Torres). They also have some ideas about Tarlos' home life...  ""I'm also excited to see who Carlos is as a husband,"" says Silva. ""I'm also excited to see if TK knocks on Carlos' door and is like, ""Hey, you ready to have a kid yet? Can we talk about this?""  ""I echo that!"" adds Rubinstein.

Rebecca Nguyen Sanchez/Facebook  Rebecca Nguyen was wearing a beautiful classic lace gown adorned with beading and spaghetti straps when she married the love of her life in August 2017. In the years since, the dress has acted as a reminder of the magical day.  ""When I wore it, I felt like me,"" Nguyen said. ""I want to say I felt like this movie star. I felt like this princess, but that wasn't me. I felt like me.""  The memories of that dream quickly turned into a nightmare on Tuesday, when she received the shock of her life, learning that her dress was suddenly missing.  ""My wedding dress was accidentally donated by one of my family members. It was a complete accident, it was during a rush of a lot of things,"" she said while speaking with KCAL News on Wednesday. ""Mistakes happen. When I found out yesterday I was pretty heartbroken.""  Nguyen says that the dress wasn't the only wedding souvenir that got donated to a Goodwill in Brea more than two weeks ago, and she immediately submitted an accidental donation form in hopes of retrieving what she could.  She's visited Goodwill's Orange County headquarters, hoping that some of the employees could help her recover the lost items.  ""It could be sitting at the warehouse, still waiting to get sorted through,"" said Chris Sewitsky, the retail director at the location. ""It just depends where and what time of day it came in. That store is a very busy store. Some stuff does stay at that store, some stuff comes back to main distribution. So, we're hoping we can find it because it is such a unique item.""  On top of her local search, Nguyen has also posted on several local Facebook pages offering to buy back the dress if it's already been purchased.  ""If you have it, please consider selling it back to me. I will pay more than you paid for it. You can even wear it for your wedding! I don't mind sharing the joy and beauty of the dress,"" one post says.  If someone does have it, she's hopeful that they're able to get as much enjoyment out of their special day as she did.  ""Not everybody can afford to get a brand new dress and that's okay. I want someone to be able to enjoy it as well,"" Nguyen said.  Anyone with more information on the missing dress can reach out to Goodwill in Brea, which is located at 634 S. Brea Boulevard, by calling (714) 255-1099.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9sb3NhbmdlbGVzL25ld3Mvb2Mtd29tYW4tZGVzcGVyYXRlbHktc2VhcmNoaW5nLWZvci13ZWRkaW5nLWRyZXNzLXRoYXQtd2FzLWFjY2lkZW50YWxseS1kb25hdGVkLXRvLWdvb2R3aWxsL9IBhwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvbG9zYW5nZWxlcy9uZXdzL29jLXdvbWFuLWRlc3BlcmF0ZWx5LXNlYXJjaGluZy1mb3Itd2VkZGluZy1kcmVzcy10aGF0LXdhcy1hY2NpZGVudGFsbHktZG9uYXRlZC10by1nb29kd2lsbC8?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The best way to organize a timeless event is to host classic affair with plenty of design details that have already proven they can stand the test of time. ""Picking wedding décor and fashion can be daunting, especially if you want your wedding to feel timeless,"" shares wedding planner Dani Blasena of HauteFêtes. ""While Instagram and Pinterest are wonderful for inspiration, they often promote the same trending ideas over and over again. In contrast, a timeless wedding is one that stands the test of time and style!"" So, if you want to plan a timeless ceremony and reception, it's best to choose color palettes, fashion, and décor that will still feel relevant in 20 years.  It's important to remember that timeless weddings can take many forms, so don't shy away from the style out of fear of planning a cookie cutter celebration. You can still infuse the day with plenty of personality. ""For me, what makes a wedding timeless is not about following the most current wedding trends or guidelines but about creating a celebration that genuinely reflects a couple's unique love story and values,"" notes wedding photographer Jenny Fu. ""It's about making an impact that lasts long after the day.""  Meet the Expert Dani Blasena is the owner, creative director and lead designer of HauteFêtes.  Jenny Fu is a New York-based wedding photographer.  Jacqueline Hallgarth is the founder of wedding and event planning company Jacqueline Hallgarth Events.  If you're hoping to plan a timeless wedding that feels right for you and your spouse-to-be, we asked wedding pros to share their favorite details. Ahead, 20 ideas you can make your own.  Photo by KT Merry; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose a Classic Destination  “Venue selection is one of the most important aspects of creating a timeless wedding,” shares planner Jacqueline Hallgarth. If you know you want to tie the knot far from home, consider a locale that's steeped in history. “You and your guests will be linked forever through this selection, so choose carefully,"" she adds. ""A destination wedding, held in historic villa in Italy or chateau in France, will not only be beautiful on your wedding day, but will also create timeless memories shared by you and all your guests. Regardless of the specific venue, beautiful memories can be created anywhere with the right elements.”  Photo by Caroline Tran; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Pick an Estate-Style Venue  Modern art galleries and open warehouses are incredible blank slates, but they're not the best choices for timeless celebrations. “Choosing an estate-style venue that is classic in architecture and will create a backdrop for your big day that is as relevant in 20 years’ time as it is today,” advises Blasena. “My favorites include Rosewood Miramar Beach for a classic Hamptons style on the West Coast replete with boxwoods and white siding. Abroad, the Belmond San Michele with views for days, classic Italian-style spaces and gardens that are breathtaking. Both venues have everything you need to make your big day truly timeless from start to finish.”  Photo by Will Reid Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Black-Tie Dress Code  What your guests wear will have an impact on the overall feel of your celebration, so picking the right attire style is important. “By requesting black-tie and formal attire, you automatically create an elevated style that translates into forever cherished photographs,” shares Hallgarth. ""Floor-length gowns and black tuxedos never go out of fashion and when captured together, creates that timeless look everyone wants from their wedding.”  Photo by Volvoreta; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Choose Greenery and White Florals  When picking out your floral design, you can never go wrong with classic white blooms and lots of lush greenery. Blasena says, “Green and white flowers are both classic and neutral and will never overwhelm a design.”  Photo by Stephanie Sunderland; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace a Soft Color Palette  Punchy colors might be trending, but are you sure you'll love Barbie pink or neon green for years to come? If the answer isn't a resounding ""yes!"" it's likely not the best choice. “A soft color palette is always a good rule of thumb,"" notes Blasena. ""Something like a French blue or classic taupe is always sophisticated and elegant. Pick two to three soft colors that suit your style best and keep it simple.”  Photo by Ryan Ray; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire the Right Wedding Photographer  You could plan a big day that's entirely timeless, but if you hire a photographer with a trendy, of-the-moment aesthetic, your photos might not stand the test of time. ""To truly capture the timeless essence of a wedding, it's crucial to work with an experienced photographer who can document your day,” shares Fu. “The photographs they capture will be a lasting reminder of the love and joy you shared on your wedding day.” Blasena adds, “A photographer with a classic editing style, natural color tones, and graceful composition will create photographs never go out of style.”  Photo by Lev Kuperman; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  And Don't Shy Away from Candid Photos  While traditional wedding portraits are essential, some couples avoid candids out of fear of looking too modern. Whatever you do, get this idea out of your head. ""Candid wedding photographs have the power to capture the true essence and emotion of your wedding day,"" says Fu. ""Let the genuine connections and meaningful moments shine–these moments are timeless because you've lived the experience, and the candid photographs can take you back long after the day has passed.""  Photo by Henry + Mac; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Wear Classic Wedding Attire  Fashion trends come and go, even in the world of weddings. “One of the most important elements of your wedding is your dress,” says Blasena. “It’s easy to get caught up in all the amazing wedding fashion there is today with designers from all over the world. To avoid looking back in horror, think timeless and classic in the cut; a soft ivory versus a stark white; and, avoid overcomplicating the style with unnecessary embellishments such as beading, tulle, or lace. Remember, less is always more!”  Photo by Lisa Poggi; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have Musicians at Your Ceremony  Acoustic versions of your favorite romantic songs can bring an emotional elegance and set the proper tone for your wedding ceremony. Consider hiring a string trio or a classical guitarist to play as you walk down the aisle.  Photo by Benjamin Wheeler and Ben Higgins; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Close Out the Ceremony With a Flower Petal Toss  Add an extra dose of joy and ensure excellent photos of your ceremony exit by having guests toss flower petals over your heads as you recess down the aisle as newlyweds.  Photo By Twah Dougherty; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Decorate With Chinoiserie  A classic décor choice for a wedding is to bring chinoiserie ceramics into your design. Used as vessels for your florals or in your dinnerware, it adds a traditional and elegant touch to the space.  Photo by Haley Rynn Ringo; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Champagne Tower  Serving Champagne is a classic choice for a wedding. Serve your favorite bubbly in coupes, stacked in a tower, to make for an extra celebratory (and photo-worthy) moment at your reception.  Photo by AGP Collective; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Up a Checkered Dance Floor  A checkered dance floor is a classic for a reason. It sets the tone for the reception and brings a retro elegance as you get down with your new spouse and guests.  Photo by Corbin Gurkin; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Embrace Candlelight  “Whether it’s dinner for two or a wedding for 250, candlelight creates an intimate atmosphere which can transform any space,” shares Blasena. “There’s nothing more magical than a candlelit room to create romance. Adding clusters of pillar and votive candles or simple white taper candles to your tabletop is an inexpensive touch that will also never go out of style.”  Photo by Anée Atelier; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Opt for Black-and-White Photos  Don’t forget to ask your photographer to edit some shots without color. “Black and white photography is classic, timeless, and elegant. It creates a sophisticated look that will never go out of style,” says Fu.  Photo by Jenny Fu; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Consider Seasonal Shades  “Featuring seasonal colors in the floral, stationery, tabletop and event design creates an event that resonates with guests emotions and ties your wedding to a place in time,” shares Hallgarth. ""I always encourage bright and colorful blooms for a spring wedding and autumnal florals and foliage for a fall wedding which captures not only the beauty of the moment, but forever marries the event to a specific feeling of the year.”  Photo by Brooke Miller Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Have a Getaway Car  After you say “I do,” there’s nothing more timeless than speeding off into the sunset with your new spouse. Find a vintage car and adorn it with florals for a charming getaway for the newlyweds as they head to the reception.  Photo by Sasithon Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Make a Grand Entrance  As the wedding reception begins, have a special moment where the emcee announces the bride and groom for the first time as they rush out onto the dance floor. The entrance is a fun and celebratory moment that can easily transition to the first dance, and it's something that's been done at weddings for decades.  Photo by Allan Zepeda Photography; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Hire a Live Band  While choosing a DJ or band for your wedding is a personal decision for a couple, there's no denying that live musicians can be an absolutely classic addition to your celebration. Make sure to do research to have your band fit the style and song selection you want for the evening.  Photo By Tailor James; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Leave With a Sparkler Exit  At the end of the evening (or before you head to the after party), have your guests line up for a sparkler send-off. It's a beautiful end to celebrations around those you love.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vdGltZWxlc3Mtd2VkZGluZy1pZGVhcy03MjU1NjU20gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The response was generally positive, with many applauding the idea and saying they wished they had thought of it themselves.  She also received curious questions and some criticism about whether it imposed extra work on her wedding staff, which prompted her to make a follow-up video saying that she tipped all service workers involved. Despite her attempted clarification, some viewers were unconvinced and alleged that she deleted a previous comment saying she hadn't tipped them.  Still, the apparent hack has inspired others to think more creatively about wedding food — so as long as restaurant and ceremony workers are properly compensated.  Mulkey did not immediately respond to multiple requests from Insider for comment.  Madison Mulkey, a photographer with over 28,000 TikTok followers, posted a video on Sunday explaining why she chose the restaurant chain Chili's for her wedding food.  She said the main attraction was the low cost — $1,950 for 99 guests. The food included chicken tenders, sliders, cajun chicken pasta, and salad. According to The Knot, the average price for traditional wedding catering can cost $75 a guest, which for Mulkey, amounted to nearly $7,500 total.  She said there were some unexpected complications that arose because they didn't want to pay the delivery fee — which would have been $300, she said in a comment. They threw their wedding on St. Patrick's Day weekend, and the restaurant was packed, so they had to pick up the food early at 11 a.m. and keep it cool before the service which was at 6 p.m.  Normally, Chili's workers would deliver and set it up, Mulkey said. But since they picked the food up directly from the restaurant, her hired servers — who were mostly hired for cleaning, she said — were forced to do a lot of the food preparations. She added that her coordinator helped them.  ""Everyone made it work, thank goodness,"" Mulkey said in the clip, which has been viewed over 1.3 million times. ""Our situation was rare. I'm sure if you order from Chili's in any other regard they would serve it and it would all be so hassle-free.""  The reaction was mostly positive, with people saying they would be excited to find out a wedding they attended was serving Chili's, and that society should normalize scaled-down weddings like this.  ""I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was chili's,"" a top comment with over 7,000 likes said. ""This is my dream,"" someone else wrote.  The official Chili's Grill & Bar TikTok account even left a comment calling the video ""iconic.""  However, some people worried that Mulkey's wedding staffers were forced to take on more work.  ""I'm all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,"" one top comment with over 1,600 likes said. ""You should have paid for delivery.""  A comment with over 2,200 likes said they'd give the poster an ""A for creativity"" but critiqued that the food was 7 hours old, which probably stressed the staff out.  The concerns for her staff prompted Mulkey to make a follow-up video. She assured viewers that she tipped the Chili's kitchen staff $300, and tipped the coordinator and the servers on top of their hourly payment.  ""All they did was make the food, help the buffet run efficiently, and then clean up,"" Mulkey said of the servers. ""I didn't ask anyone to work outside of their bounds or their means.""  Viewers, however, did not seem entirely convinced. Several comments on the follow-up video accused her of deleting a comment from her original viral video where they said she told another user she hadn't tipped anyone extra since it was included in their original payment (Insider was unable to find and verify the original comment).  Someone also claimed that Chili's managers aren't able to receive tips which prompted them to ask how she was able to tip them. (Insider could not independently verify this but has reached out to the company for comment.)  ""Maybe they didn't take it, I have no idea what they did with it,"" Mulkey wrote in response. ""We gave chilis a lump sum.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXIuY29tL2JyaWRlLXdlZGRpbmctc2VydmVkLWNoaWxpcy1mb29kLW5vLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LWZlZS0yMDIzLTXSAVNodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9icmlkZS13ZWRkaW5nLXNlcnZlZC1jaGlsaXMtZm9vZC1uby1kZWxpdmVyeS1mZWUtMjAyMy01P2FtcA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-10-01","14:00:00","Not Discerned","Thu 18 May 2023 04:31:00","If you're running out of unique venues or destinations to have your wedding, look no further. Weddings in space are now a thing and we heard it is truly out of this world.  If the thought of nuptials on Earth sound common and boring, a space travel company wants to give you the chance to get hitched at a venue looking down on the third rock from the sun instead.  The company, called Space Perspective, is offering couples a memorable way to say “I do” — putting the bride and groom into orbit using a carbon-neutral balloon with giant windows to make the most of the ultimate view of planet Earth.  According to Jane Poynter, the co-founder of Space Perspective, the waiting list to get married amongst the stars is already light-years long.  “We’ve already had people wanting to be the first marriage in space, so we’ll see who is the first,” Poynter told The Cool Down.  “Unlike all other spacecraft whereby the crewed compartment separates from one flight system mid-flight and transfers to another flight system, Spaceship Neptune’s capsule remains secured to the SpaceBalloon the entire flight from liftoff to splashdown, creating a seamlessly safe and gentle flight,” she explained.  The website said the technology the spacecraft uses has already been “proven,” as it has been used for decades by NASA teams and other government agencies to “lift research telescopes and other heavy, sensitive instruments.”  Space Perspective was founded by two former crew members of Biosphere 2, an Earth system science research facility located in Arizona, which was originally constructed to explore the potential of closed ecological systems in supporting human life during outer-space missions.  Vincent Bachet, Space Perspective lead and development engineer, added that Neptune’s windows are going to be “the biggest windows flown into space.”  Using hyper-resistant materials and a special anti-UV coating, Space Perspective co-founder and co-CEO Taber MacCallum called them “the quintessential part of the experience.”  Couples who are interesting in the unique wedding experience can join the waitlist on Space Perspective’s website for late 2024.

"wedding","2008-01-01","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 13:30:00","If you asked Carolina Favero Braga if she would end up with Freud Milice as she began her emergency room rotation in 2015, her answer would likely be a resounding no. The twosome worked alongside each other for two weeks at Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn when she was a medical school student and he was a resident. As Carolina puts it, their courtship wasn’t exactly love at first sight. “I was skeptical of his big personality and braggadocios behavior,” Carolina admits. “On our first few days working together, he told me he loved house parties, red wine, and older women. Eye roll.”  But, in a plot twist of romantic comedy proportions, Freud managed to get Carolina’s number and would text her after every shift—and even when she traveled to Florida. “On the day I was returning to New York, he knew I was anxious about flying, and sent me Angus and Julia Stone’s ‘Big Jet Plane’ single to keep me calm throughout the flight. When I landed at JFK, he surprised me and was waiting at baggage claim. Five days later, we went on our first official date. As they say, the rest is history.”  Fast-forward to June 5, 2020, when the couple was taking a socially distanced trip to the Catskills. As physicians, both Carolina and Freud were on the frontlines of the Covid-19 pandemic and took a well-deserved vacation once restrictions began to loosen. “When we arrived, the hotel staff recommended a walk in the garden prior to dinner,” she shares. “We got ready and while walking the garden, Freud got down on one knee. I am sure he had more to say but all I remember is, ‘Will you marry me?’” The answer? A resounding yes.  When it came to planning their September 3, 2022, wedding, the couple wanted their special day to highlight the bride’s Brazilian background and the groom’s Haitian roots. They enlisted wedding planner Nathalie Cadet-James of Luxe Fete, who had the perfect spot in mind: Itapororoca Villa in Trancoso, Brazil. “There is the essence of West Africa in this rustic Brazilian beach town,” the bride explains. “With its scenic backdrops and rich culture, we knew this was the perfect place to share our love story with family and friends.”  With 80 of their closest friends and family members in attendance, their destination was a beautiful representation of Carolina and Freud in every way imaginable. “As an interracial couple, it was important for us to highlight our different backgrounds,” the bride shares. “Nathalie is Haitian-American, and she really understood who we were as individuals, but also as a couple. Her excitement to celebrate our love story was noticeable from before we even officially hired her.” Read on for an intimate look at Carolina and Freud’s wedding festivities, as photographed by Heather Waraksa.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Carolina and Freud didn’t have to look too far for wedding inspiration. Elements of Trancoso’s seaside beauty were woven throughout the weekend. From watercolor illustrations to magenta accents that pay tribute to the local bougainvillea flowers, the invitation suite from LetterHeads Miami gave guests the perfect glimpse of what was to come.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The couple kicked off the festivities with a beach party the night before the wedding. Carolina stunned in a white dress from Farm Rio, while Freud looked effortlessly elegant in a white button-down from Peter Millar and matching shorts.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “Our wedding [weekend] didn’t have a traditional timeline,” the bride shares. “We had our maid of honor and best man make their speeches during the welcome party so they could enjoy themselves. We know the effort it took for our guests to celebrate with us and we wanted them to enjoy themselves to the fullest.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  I don’t know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Come the wedding day, the bride wore a strapless gown from Valentini Spose, which beautifully fulfilled her “clean and timeless vision.” She shares, “I truly believed that this was my day and wanted to wear something that made me feel spectacular. I was also three months postpartum when I started shopping for a wedding dress, so it was important for me to feel confident in it."" Carolina adds, ""I don’t know how to describe it, but I knew the dress was made for me.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  When it came to accessorizing her gown, Carolina knew she wanted to support women-owned businesses. She opted for a veil by Jennifer Leigh Couture Veils, Julia Vaughn jewelry, and a special pair of shoes from Brother Vellies. “During the beginning of the pandemic, I followed [Brother Vellies founder] Aurora James on Instagram,” Carolina explains. “It had to be fate that [she] designed a bridal shoe line for HBO’s Insecure. I texted Nathalie and the team and said, ‘I know I don’t have a dress yet, but I know this is the shoe.’ So, I actually bought my bridal shoes before I had a dress!”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Meanwhile, the groom suited up in a custom navy tuxedo from Suitsupply. Rounding out the look was a tie from Tom Ford, Hermès shoes, and his everyday accessories. “Freud wore his watch and a bracelet which was engraved with his daughter’s name,” Carolina adds.

Photo by Heather Waraksa  Freud spent months writing his vows during his night shifts, promising to “be present, to be here next week, next month, next year, and the year after that.” Meanwhile, Carolina performed a song she often sings to their daughter at night. Her favorite lyrics: “I love you in the morning, and in the afternoon. I love you in the evening, and underneath the moon.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  The newlyweds slipped on their wedding bands from Boccardo Jewelers, shared a kiss, and recessed down the aisle to Bob Marley’s “Is This Love.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Make time to enjoy special moments with each other.

There was one long table in the reception area with no assigned seating, which was to be decorated with magenta flowers among greenery.” The bride’s favorite area was the dessert room—a bougainvillea-adorned space that displayed “hundreds of sweets” on floating trays.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  If guests were craving fresh air, they could hang out in one of the venue’s chill outdoor seating areas.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  True to their love story, Carolina and Freud shared a sweet first dance to Angus and Julia Stone’s “Big Jet Plane.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  While the newlyweds opted for a buffet style of local Bahian-inspired food—courtesy of O Cacau—they tapped Confet Doceria to whip up a four-tiered cake. “We had two different flavors. One layer was white cake with brigadeiro filling, [which is a traditional Brazilian dessert],” the bride explains. “The other layers were white cake with dulce de leche filling.”  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Photo by Heather Waraksa  Since Carolina and Freud love music—they have a shared fondness of hip-hop—they wanted to find a DJ who understood their taste. “We worked closely with our DJ, Nath Carreiro, to play music that played significant parts in our lives both as individuals and as a couple,” the groom notes. ""We shared with her Spotify playlists for both the welcome party and the wedding. DJ Nath was a smashing success!"" In fact, the newlyweds even infiltrated the DJ booth during the evening with their daughter, Celine.  Photo by Heather Waraksa  “We were on the dance floor for most of the wedding,” Freud explains. But, according to the couple, guests left the event with more than some new dance moves. “Because many of our friends had never been to Brazil before, we focused a high level of detail on the experience that our guests would have,” Carolina shares. “Freud created a WhatsApp group with all the guests as a way for everyone to connect a few weeks prior to the wedding. Our guests were able to get to know each other and it made it even more special on the wedding day. The group is still going strong to this day!” Whether it’s an inner circle or excellent vendors, no love story is complete without the people cheering you on along the way.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vYm91Z2FpbnZpbGxlYS1icmF6aWxpYW4td2VkZGluZy03NDk4Nzgz0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

They reportedly expected 160 guests from across the country to attend their June 24 wedding.  The couple says their plans were turned upside down when they learned their hotel block had been cancelled to make room for migrants that were being sent upstate by New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The Crossroads Hotel was tapped to accept migrants who were being bused from New York City to hotels in Westchester and the Hudson Valley.  ""We woke up the other morning and got a phone call from my sister...to check out the news,"" Moretti told "" Jesse Watters Primetime "" on Tuesday. ""No phone call, no text message, no email from them about any cancellations. I call them up and ... I asked them about the migrants going in there, is it going to be safe for my guests and ourselves to be there.

In a new interview in Brides magazine, the Dancing with the Stars alum, who turns 38 on Wednesday, and his fiancée, 28, revealed that the price of planning a wedding has come as a bit of a shock.  ""It's a very eye-opening experience, and when you start to add everything up, it's pretty wild,"" Hough said.  As the pieces for their ceremony and reception come together, the couple revealed that they have already chosen a venue, and that fireworks and a first dance — naturally — are in the cards.  For the choreographer and actor, and his dancer bride-to-be, the wedding isn't so much about ""perfection"" as it is about a ""vibe,"" which is important when it comes to the guest list.  ""A rule that we've set is that we don't want to catch up with people on the day of the wedding,"" Erbert said. ""We're inviting people that maybe we haven't seen in a while, but every time we get together with them, it's like we pick up right where we left off, or they're people that have been consistently in our lives throughout the years.

""What we gravitate towards isn't always the most lavish option. We're playing with different approaches to certain things so that the day still feels elegant and beautiful and magical, but grounded and down to earth and just approachable.""  He added, ""We want the entire day to be a blast.""  And as for that first dance, Erbert revealed that it will be a special moment, even if Hough wasn't so interested in the wedding tradition at first.  ""We perform for a living, so we just want this dance to be for us,"" she said. ""We don't want to perform for anyone else.""  Adds Hough: ""We want to feel good and comfortable, but we don't need to be perfect… That's a lot less important to me than just looking into her eyes as we're rocking back and forth. I want to feel truly present in that moment.""  As the big day draws near, Hough said that the couple has remained grounded and focused on what's really important.  ""At the end of the day we come back to, 'Why are we doing this? What is the reason for this?'"" Hough said. ""And the reason is for the two of us.

The suit, filed Wednesday in South Carolina's Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Common Pleas by Aric Hutchinson and two other people hurt in the crash, names more than a half dozen defendants including Jamie Lee Komoroski, who police arrested in connection to the April 28th death of Samantha Miller 34.  Miller, from Charlotte, North Carolina, was killed in the Folly Beach crash in Charleston County.  Three other of Miller's family members, including Hutchinson, suffered major injuries in the two-vehicle late evening crash.  The lawsuit also names five local businesses as defendants and claims Komoroski, 25, had been ""bar hopping"" the day of the wreck, which according to an arrest affidavit, involved a rented Toyota Camry slamming into the golf cart.  In addition to wrongful death, the 28-page suit also accuses the defendants of gross negligence, reckless hiring, supervision and training as well as ""negligent infliction of emotional distress.""  'Noticeably and visibly intoxicated'  A responding Folly Beach police officer, who found the victims on the ground at the scene, said the driver of the Camry smelled strongly of alcohol and admitted to drinking ""one beer and a drink with tequila about an hour ago.""  “Despite being noticeably and visibly intoxicated at each of these establishments,” the lawsuit reads, “Jaime Komoroski continued to be served, provided, and/or allowed to consume alcohol in each of them.”  Former Raider enters plea in DUI caseEx-Raider Henry Ruggs pleads guilty to driving drunk at 156 mph, causing fatal crash  ""This case is about keeping our community safe from drunk drivers, and an important part of that effort is making sure the establishments we entrust with liquor licenses live up to their responsibility to serve alcohol responsibly,"" the family's Charleston-based attorney Danny Dalton said.  The plaintiffs ask for a jury trial and seek punitive damages among other costs in connection to the case.  Just married  Earlier this month, Folly Beach Public Safety Department Chief Andrew Gilreath told USA TODAY Hutchinson and Miller were married just hours before the 10:15 p.m. wreck.  Police said data retrieved from Komoroski’s rental car show she was driving 65 mph and briefly hit the brakes before she slammed into the golf cart.  Komoroski, who is from Charleston, refused a sobriety and a breath test, according to her arrest affidavit. She was arrested and medical personnel drew a blood sample from her.  Prince Harry in harrowing ""car chase""Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan say they were in 'near catastrophic' car chase with paparazzi  According to additional court papers, when her blood was drawn her Blood Alcohol Content was 0.261, more than three times the legal limit to drive.

"wedding","2019-07-01","14:00:00","{""WestHartford"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 00:00:00","Getting engaged, planning a wedding, and preparing for life with your favorite person is one of the most exciting and joyful times of your life, but it can also be rife with familial conflicts, disagreements over the budget, and the need for a lot of compromises. Still, every challenge you face while planning your wedding is an opportunity to improve your relationship, strengthen your bond, and deepen your communication skills as a couple.  “Defining your shared values, navigating conflict, getting on the same page in terms of finances, deciding how we spend time in relationships outside of our primary relationships—any number of topics that come up during wedding planning need to get negotiated on an ongoing basis,” says Jennifer Uhrlass, licensed marriage and family therapist at Modern MFT in New York City. “It has to be an ongoing, open dialogue, which is really training for the ongoing negotiations that are going that are going to take place along the course of the relationship.”  Meet the Expert Jennifer Uhrlass is a licensed marriage and family therapist (LMFT) at Modern MFT in New York City.  Ahead, Uhrlass speaks to us about how this crucial window of time—the engagement period—can be an opportunity for couples to strengthen their relationship and build new skills as partners.  Communicate and Compromise  Every aspect of your wedding is about the two of you as a couple, which means you’ll both need to compromise to create a day that speaks to two different personalities. Sometimes it’s easy: Maybe one partner doesn’t care about the signature cocktails or the other partner doesn’t have a preference for the reception exit. But when only one partner is set on a destination wedding, or wants a religious ceremony, or won’t trim the guest list, the middle ground can be much harder to find.  The key, says Uhrlass, is making sure you take the time to fully listen to and process your partner’s wishes—and express your own—so that you can come to an agreement you are both on board with. “Do you truly, truly hear and understand the other person’s perspective, or are you just glossing over stuff and moving forward without understanding?” she says. “There are times when you can miss each other’s message—the message sent is not always the message received. Recognize the importance of slowing down the interaction, making sure you heard and understood what your partner said, and making sure that you can come to a mutual understanding.”  Get Into an Argument—or Several  Arguments about the details of your wedding—whether it’s your partner’s desire to torpedo the guest list by adding three tables of fraternity brothers or your own insistence on a specific type of music—are precursors to future conflicts in your life together. How you approach and solve these conflicts helps you lay the foundation for healthy and productive disagreements in the future. “Learning how to navigate conflict effectively with your partner is essential,” says Uhrlass. “You have to be able to do that well with each other because the problems are going to be perpetual. There's always going to be a need to navigate and negotiate ongoing issues throughout the course of the relationship.” Today it’s the guest list and cake flavors; tomorrow it may be where to send your kids to school or how to spend your year-end bonus. “Often, partners tend to get caught up in the content of a disagreement, when it can be much more productive to focus on their process of engagement when it comes to a particular conflict,” says Uhrlass. “What’s important is to learn how to navigate that conflict effectively; not so much trying to avoid conflict altogether, but to recognize that conflict is a healthy part of a relationship.”  Photo by Getty Images; Design by Mehroz Kapadia  Set Family Boundaries  Weddings can bring out the best in your family, but there's no denying that they can also bring out the worst. Explaining to your parents that you won’t be tying the knot at your childhood church, telling your mother-in-law her entire bridge club didn’t make the guest list, breaking the news to your siblings that their toddlers won’t be invited to the reception: These family conflicts (and many others) have the potential to put you and your partner on opposite teams. As you prepare for your wedding, it's important to remember that you’re also developing a new team of your own. “One of the natural challenges around the topic of getting married is that there’s a shift: You were part of one family unit and now you’re cultivating a new family unit in your relationship with your partner,” says Uhrlass. “Moving through this identity shift can bring up a lot of conflicts and a lot of emotion.”  Use this time to set collective boundaries as a couple, understand each other’s family history, and prioritize your partnership. “It is possible to work through this through dialogue and understanding each person’s perspective,” says Urhlass. “’Your mom wants this, however, for us, we’re also weighing this and this,’—you want to make sure that you get on the same page so you can make decisions together as a unit.”  Talk About Money  How you choose to finance your wedding is a microcosm of the larger financial decisions you’ll make in the future: How you put together a budget, and whether you’ll stick to it; whether you’re willing to take on credit card debt or loans, or accept money from either set of parents; whether your individual incomes and spending patterns are causing unseen conflict. Deciding whether you want to splurge on a band or spend less on a DJ is a precursor to future conversations about which house is in your budget, whether you’ll put a vacation on your credit card, and how often you need to upgrade your television. “Navigating issues related to finances is a common point of contention,” says Urhlass. “It could bring up difficult emotions such as fear or feelings of inadequacy. There may also be significant power differentials; in a relationship where there's a disparity in income, it can negatively impact a couple's ability to address issues in a productive way. If partners haven't reached a place where they feel comfortable, there can be a lot to unpack there. If you're just leaving it festering in the background, and you're not really addressing it, then they will tend to get worse, or stay unaddressed, which can lead to contempt later on.”  Give Each Other Space to Destress  Every major life change brings a heightened period of stress, and you and your partner will need to know how to take care of yourselves—and each other—to get through them. “Learning to take care of yourself through the very difficult wedding planning process is, I think, an essential element to navigating life effectively,” says Uhrlass. “If we're stressed to the max and we're not taking care of ourselves, we're not working out, we're not getting our proper sleep, we're not getting nutrition, or we're not spending time with friends, it’s going to have a major impact on how we approach topics and conflict and disagreements. It's really important to step back and stick to routines that are helpful to manage the stress effectively.”  This could mean planning your meal tasting around your partner’s weekly round of golf, making sure you have enough money set aside for weekend excursions (instead of putting all travel on hold until your honeymoon), or maintaining your Friday date night—no wedding talk allowed. “Set aside time to have space with each other,” says Uhrlass. “Spend time with each other nurturing your relationship, as opposed to talking about the to-do list for the wedding.  Define Your Shared Values  A shared vision for your big day can also help you define the elements that will become your family’s values moving forward: How closely will you follow religious traditions? How often will you see your parents and siblings? What constitutes a worthwhile financial investment? How do you, as a couple and as individuals, define and deepen your relationships with your friends? “Two people can have very different beliefs and philosophies about money, or [anything] across the board,” says Urhlass. “That doesn't necessarily mean that they're incompatible. It just might mean that there's more to talk about, that they understand each other and make sure that they can be on the same page in terms of their long-term goals, their values, and how they want to move forward in their lives developing a sense of identity as a couple.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vaG93LXdlZGRpbmctcGxhbm5pbmctc3RyZW5ndGhlbnMtcmVsYXRpb25zaGlwLTcyNTU2NTnSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

We focused in particular on any appearance concerns that they had and how these made them feel – from the planning stage right up to the big day itself.  One hundred and thirty-four women took part in either an interview or an online survey. They were a mix of women planning their weddings and those who had been married in the past three years. Many women experienced feelings of pressure and expectation to look a certain way on their wedding day.  This article is part of Quarter Life, a series about issues affecting those of us in our twenties and thirties. From the challenges of beginning a career and taking care of our mental health, to the excitement of starting a family, adopting a pet or just making friends as an adult. The articles in this series explore the questions and bring answers as we navigate this turbulent period of life.

They told us that others’ perceptions of how they looked affected their own feelings, both on the wedding day and afterwards. One said:  If you know other people think you look nice then you have more confidence.  Another told us:  I didn’t want to feel ashamed of my appearance. I knew there would be a lot of attention and comments on it. Didn’t want to feel like I’d let people down…there were lots of questions about my appearance and dresses mainly from other women. It felt like how I looked was part of the ‘decoration’ in the same way the table settings and order of service was.  Many of the women we spoke to felt the need to adhere to these pressures through fear of judgment and the expectation that all brides should look beautiful.  Looking back  The knowledge that wedding photographs and videos would provide permanent visual evidence of how they looked added to body image pressures. One said:  I wanted to look back at the photographs and feel 100% comfortable with what I saw.  The pressure felt by the women we spoke to also stemmed from the bridal industry, which perpetuates norms and assumptions about how brides should look. One woman, for example, talked about a bad experience she had in a bridalwear shop:  I felt the ladies in the dress shop were quite judgemental, saying I needed to eat better and basically lose weight, so I felt very negative towards me.  Nearly 70% of the women we spoke to who were planning their weddings intended to lose weight in preparation for their wedding day. The pressure to lose weight had a significant effect on their feelings and emotions. One said:  I’m really worried that preparing my weight for my wedding will re-trigger my anorexia and I don’t think people talk about the unnecessary pressure for brides and grooms to lose weight.  Some of the women reported going to extreme measures to achieve their weight-loss goals, including surgery. One had a gastric band fitted in the run-up to the wedding: this is a band around the stomach that limits its expansion, leading to feeling full sooner. Another had a tummy tuck – cosmetic surgery to improve the shape of the stomach area.  Among the women we spoke to who were already married, only 27% had reached the weight they wanted to for their wedding. One said:  I was distressed when I realised I wouldn’t achieve this weight. I then felt fine approaching the day itself. However, I felt embarrassed after seeing photos of me and regretted getting married at my weight.  Our findings back up what other researchers have found in countries outside of the UK, such as in Australia and the US. This research has drawn attention to the powerful pressures related to wedding appearance and the expectation of how women should look when getting married.  If you are getting married, then it is completely natural for you to want to look your best, but prioritise your own wellbeing, too.  If one of your friends or family members is getting married, or if you work in the wedding industry, be conscious of what you are saying to the brides in your life. Make sure you are not inadvertently adding any pressures or expectations to them by commenting on their appearance during what can already be a stressful time. Focus on the joy and connection that is the real heart of a wedding.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3RoZWNvbnZlcnNhdGlvbi5jb20vaXQtZmVsdC1saWtlLWhvdy1pLWxvb2tlZC13YXMtcGFydC1vZi10aGUtZGVjb3JhdGlvbi1ob3ctZ2V0dGluZy13ZWQtYWZmZWN0cy13b21lbnMtYm9keS1pbWFnZS0yMDI4ODLSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjb252ZXJzYXRpb24uY29tL2FtcC9pdC1mZWx0LWxpa2UtaG93LWktbG9va2VkLXdhcy1wYXJ0LW9mLXRoZS1kZWNvcmF0aW9uLWhvdy1nZXR0aW5nLXdlZC1hZmZlY3RzLXdvbWVucy1ib2R5LWltYWdlLTIwMjg4Mg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Parrott opened Parrott Floral Co. last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  CEDAR RAPIDS -- Cassie Parrott has expressed herself through flowers all of her adult life.  “For me, it’s the creative side, and getting to share my artistic abilities through florals,” Parrott said one recent morning. “I’m horrible at drawing or painting or anything like that, but when it comes to being creative on the flower side...”  Parrott, 32, began working for florists soon after graduating from Cedar Rapids Jefferson High School, just a few blocks from her home. She kept working while completing Kirkwood Community College’s horticulture program.  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her Parrott Floral Co. home design studio last Wednesday in southwest Cedar Rapids. She opened her business last year. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Advertisement  Gaining some 15 years experience, Parrott and her husband, Joey, decided last year it was time to strike out on her own.  “I had been doing it for other businesses and just decided I wanted to be doing it for myself,” she said. “I knew what it all entailed, and what I needed.”  A small toolshed in her backyard became her studio, freshened with new paint and outfitted with work tables and a florist’s refrigerator to keep blooms fresh.  “Thankfully, we had this workshop,” she said. “It was just storage. We started converting, and it went really quickly after I decided I wanted to for-sure do it.”  Wedding specialty  Parrott’s goal is to specialize on weddings, but she’s taken other business during her start-up.  “From the beginning, I knew I was going to have to do some everyday retail,” she said. “Friends and family will say, ‘Hey, can you do a birthday bouquet for me tomorrow?’ And I can make it happen.”  Business News Newsletter Signup Newsletter Signup Delivered to your inbox weekdays Email Please wait...

Without a traditional storefront, which she didn’t want to invest in, Parrott typically begins the design process in customers’ homes, where being a one-woman operation has its advantages.  “I have the capabilities and the time to actually get to know each one of my brides and give my undivided attention to them and not have to worry about other customers coming in,” she said.  Large, elaborate displays are popular for this season’s weddings, she said.  “Big, colorful arches and hanging installations,” Parrott said. “Big statement pieces are the trendy things right now.”  Most customers have at least some idea what they’re after.  “A lot of times they have somewhat of a vision,” she said. “They’ve gone to Pinterest or Google or Instagram or TikTok and found pictures they like. I guide them and make it fit within their budget and make their vision come to life for them.”  Cassie Parrott creates a flower arrangement for a client at her home floral design studio in Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Using social media  Social media also is a key marketing tool.  “When you’re starting a business, anything free is helpful,” Parrott said. “Anytime we do a wedding and they post pictures and tag us in it, that helps spread the word.  “Those relationships with other wedding vendors help. A venue, a dress shop, a tux shop, a bakery, we all get together and make a mock wedding, and it’s photographed and we post that on our socials.”  Parrott works through a wholesale florist in Illinois and directly with big flower farms in Ecuador and Chile. In-season, she also buys locally grown blooms.  Managing deliveries, she said, is vital.  “When somebody’s buying a bouquet for a birthday or anniversary, they want that to last as long as possible. I want to get that in right before the occasion and get it out to them in the form where it’s barely started blooming,” she said. “With a wedding, they’re wanting (the full bloom). Depending what kinds of blooms, I have a process where I get them to their full potential for the wedding day.”  Friends, family help  Parrott is her namesake company’s sole full-time employee, but friends and family help with deliveries and building elaborate arrangements. Peak wedding season brings some early-morning starts.  “We’re always one of the first vendors at a wedding on Saturday,” she said. “You want to be in and out, so once they start with pictures that’s all done. By about noon I have everything set up.”  Cassie Parrott dyes flowers made out of wood shavings to create at floral arrangement for a client Wednesday at her home design studio in southwest Cedar Rapids. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette)  Despite working through the pandemic’s lingering supply-chain effects -- Parrott estimates wholesale flower costs have tripled -- she’s optimistic about her business’ first busy season.  “When I opened, my main concern was just getting clients and getting my name out there as my business and myself,” she said. “But I’ve booked 11 weddings since September. For my first eight months, that seems like a pretty good number.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL215LWJpei1tYWtpbmctYS1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1mbG93ZXJzL9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdhemV0dGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL215LWJpei1tYWtpbmctYS1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtd2l0aC1mbG93ZXJzLz9hbXA9MQ?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

However, there were also many B-town celebs who decided to keep their wedding an intimate affair. The trend of having a secret and hush-hush wedding also started after the Covid-19 pandemic.  But, did you know that ‘Vivaah’ actress Amrita Rao married the love of her life RJ Anmol at a temple in Pune on a budget as low as Rs 1,50,000?  View this post on Instagram A post shared by AMRITA RAO 🇮🇳 (@amrita_rao_insta)  Recently, the couple released a YouTube video on their official channel wherein they elaborated on the cost of their wedding, the venue, and how they were able to pull off a close-knit shaadi in that budget.  In the ‘Anniversary Special’ episode of ‘Couple Of Things’, they took us down memory lane to the place they got married nine years ago.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The handful of people who attended their wedding traveled from Mumbai to Iskcon Temple in Katraj, Pune where the couple secretly tied the knot. As for the stay and other functions like Sangeet, Mehendi, and Karaoke Night, the couple booked a hotel on the outskirts of Pune.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by RJ Anmol (@rjanmol27)  The couple further revealed that the outfits they wore were very traditional and cost not more than Rs 3000 each because they didn’t want to wear designer clothes. The ‘Main Hoon Na’ actor also wore all artificial jewellery on her wedding day.  “When I told Anmol that I wanted to buy jewellery, he had told me ‘Abhi q shopping karni hai, tabhi karo na shaadi k baad.’ And when the wedding happened, we were busy building our house so we had no time to shop. So, I wore artificial jewellery top to bottom. I was very angry.”  In the video, the couple then visited their wedding venue and relived those fond memories.  Amrita further revealed that she also carried her makeup kit and did her wedding makeup herself. Her family members helped her get ready for the special occasion.  They also added that one of the reasons they wanted to get married in Pune was because Amrita’s grandparents were in Pune so it was easier for them to travel to the venue. Concluding the video, Amrita shared:  “We always believed that weddings should be about love, not about showing off wealth and ostentation. We wanted our wedding to be a beautiful, intimate affair with just our immediate families & close friends, and we’re glad we were able to achieve that without spending a fortune.”  To this, RJ Anmol added, “Our wedding was a reflection of our personalities, and we wanted to keep it humble. We would be happy if this inspires people to opt for budget-friendly weddings too.”  Clearly, you don’t have to spend crores to make memories and get married to the love of your life.

As event planners string marigold flower chains and pitch a pole tent for the festivities, mania ensues. The bride-to-be, Aditi, is torn between her feelings for her ex-lover and her soon-to-be husband, the wedding planner falls in love with the family’s maid, and buried family secrets come to the surface during the days-long celebration. “Nair’s celebration rings joyful and cathartic: as a love song to her home city of Delhi and to her own Punjabi family,” says the musical’s synopsis. “At its core, it’s a story of families: how they love, rejoice, and endure together.”  calling all nyers and well wishers to immediately go see Mira Nair’s brilliant *Monsoon Wedding: The Musical* pic.twitter.com/twgjkJRP5n — Manan Ahmed (@sepoy) May 14, 2023  The production was first staged in 2017 at Berkeley Repertory Theater, where it received mixed reviews, the Bay Area Player reported at the time. Work on the adaptation began in 2006, with Nair and the film’s screenwriter, Dhawan, collaborating with composer Vishal Bhardwaj and the lyricist Susan Birkenhead. Nair told The Times that “she’d been inspired by the 2004 Broadway revival of “Fiddler on the Roof,” a show built around cultural traditions adapting to survive.  The Times further notes that “like the film, the musical touches upon the fallout of India’s 1947 partition, brought to life in the characters’ religious, social and economic differences. Nair told the publication that the film is about “our families, but so deeply universal — this essential story of understanding a whole society and movement through a very personal story.”  However, the musical deviates a little from the film, in terms of messaging. For the musical, Nair had to revisit one of the film’s subplots, she told The Times, “about a relative’s grooming and sexual abuse of two younger family members.” A “concerted effort” was made to have “the women question the patriarchy and speak up,” Nair said. “Other characters who are afflicted by this don’t shove it under the rug; they make decisions in their own lives that reflect that they will not accept this behavior, which we didn’t have before.”  The change is reflective of Nair’s work which “has never shied away from examining cultural distinctions,” The Times notes. “Mississippi Masala” (1991) explored the interracial romance between a Black man and Indian American woman, “Salaam Bombay!” (1988), revolved around children living in the slums.  “Monsoon Wedding” is currently playing at St. Ann’s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, through June 25.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL2FtZXJpY2Fua2FoYW5pLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3N0YWdlLWFkYXB0YXRpb24tb2YtbWlyYS1uYWlycy1tb25zb29uLXdlZGRpbmctbWFrZXMtY29uY2VydGVkLWVmZm9ydC10by1xdWVzdGlvbi1wYXRyaWFyY2h5L9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Pic: Erin McGregor/Instagram  One follower asked the pair if they had decided between 'a wedding singer or music in the church?' prompting the duo to reveal they wouldn't be opting for a church wedding.  Erin answered: 'We don't want a church... do you want to say why we don't want a church?  'Eh, because of Harry,' Terry simply stated.  'So, Harry would feel better in an outdoor [setting] so it wouldn't be as overwhelming and the noise wouldn't be as intense for him,' Erin explained.  'Always worth the try' -- Erin McGregor shares realities of travelling with young son 'We want -- Har is our main man,' Terry added. Erin shared that six-year-old son Harry, who lives with autism, would be more comfortable outdoors, adding that he would be likely to want to leave a church setting.  'Yeah, so he can be part of it. Even if he wants to run off, he's still there where he'd probably want to leave a church.  'He likes the outdoors, so that works for us,' Terry said.  Turning their attention back to the question at hand, Erin asked her husband-to-be what type of music he wanted for their big day.  Erin shared that six-year-old son Harry, who lives with autism, would be more comfortable outdoors, adding that he would be likely to want to leave a church setting.

'I'm talking about what you want!' he protested, as Erin ended the video.  The couple also lifted the lid on potentially eloping, with a follower revealing their friend eloped recently and it was 'zero stress.'  'I mean, it's been a long road,' Erin replied.  Erin and Terry have been bringing their followers along as they check out potential venues for their wedding, with the pair heading to Italy and Portugal with hopes of a wedding abroad.

The Gardeners' World star, 67, and his wife Sarah were pictured at their son's nuptials back in July 2020 – which happened to be their own wedding anniversary. For the occasion, the pair proved their penchant for florals as they stepped out in summery outfits that may have been inspired by their Herefordshire garden, Longmeadow.  WATCH: Monty Don shares personal garden transformation  Monty offset his classic white shirt and black suit with a blue tie covered with yellow flowers, while Sarah tied in with his colour scheme in a stunning pastel blue frock. It featured a high neckline, long sleeves, a ditsy floral print and navy piping which she teamed with pearl drop earrings and her blonde hair in a sleek straight bob.  The celebrity gardener captioned the candid photo, which appears to have been taken at the wedding breakfast: ""3 years ago on this day Sarah and I were celebrating our son Adam’s marriage to Emily. On the same day 37 years ago we were married too.""  © Instagram Monty and Sarah's son got married in 2017  At the time, fans rushed to comment on the couple's outfits, writing: ""Look at you all poshed up,"" and: ""I love the tie."" A third added: ""Lucky Monty, Sarah is a beauty.""  Monty and Sarah chose much more timeless outfits on their own wedding day. On their 39th anniversary in 2022, he shared one rare throwback photo, taken in 1983, which showed the newlyweds standing outside a set of wrought iron gates, with Monty's new wife rocking an unconventional blue outfit.  Sarah ditched bridal white for a dusty cornflower jacket with large buttons down the front, which she paired with a chunky necklace and matching earrings.  Meanwhile, Monty didn't appear to have aged at all – he sported the same thick curly hair and big grin and wore a cream suit and black spotty tie.  He accompanied the photo with a heartfelt message to his childhood sweetheart Sarah, whom he met at Cambridge University. ""We got married 39 years ago today - the picture is a little faded, a little wrinkly, like us but the love is as evergreen and strong now as it was all those years ago,"" Monty sweetly wrote.  Monty and Sarah share three children, Tom, Adam and Freya, and they are proud grandparents to George and Daisy Rose. However, Sarah candidly opened up about her ill health following childbirth and the impact it had on their marriage in their book, The Jewel Garden.  ""I was ill for months after our daughter was born despite having had a supposedly film-star birth at an enormously expensive private London hospital,"" Sarah wrote. ""I had a slipped disc, a result of the bodged delivery, and was so anaemic that I needed a blood transfusion.  ""My injuries were not acknowledged and as we tried to leave the hospital I had to walk down three flights of stairs because the lift had broken. I was unable to walk or stand properly for over a year,"" she shared.  Being bedridden put a strain on their relationship, with Sarah candidly writing: ""When it came down to it, Montagu was a loony and I was ill all the time.""

She donned a pink, peachy shade that was minimal, yet memorable – perfectly in line with her understated elegance and effortless personal style.  On her wedding day, Richie told Vogue that she wanted her look to feel timeless. Richie enlisted makeup artist Pati Dubroff, who leaned into subtle enhancements to the star’s natural beauty. Paired with a glossy gold lid and sunkissed blush, Dubroff accentuated her lips with a sheerness that wasn’t too saturated. “We wanted the lips to look fresh and soft, and not have a weighty lipstick feeling. Kissable lips!” she explains. In the end, this was achieved with a Chanel tinted lip balm accompanied by a natural contour shade lip pencil.  Chanel Rouge Coco Baume Hydrating Beautifying Tinted Lip Balm Buildable Colour £34 at CHANEL  Part of the intrigue of Rouge Coco Baume is how it veils the lips in a practical, buildable colour. As you layer your chosen shade, the finish transforms from a sheer, barely there color to a more opaque and luminous pigment. Richie’s lip was done with shade 928 Pink Delight, one of nine shades that range from rich reds to iridescent pearls. My personal favorite? 914 Natural Charm, which enhances my pout’s natural colour.  “The Rouge Coco Baume range is hydrating and my constant go to!” Dubroff says, admitting that the formula is perfect for not only summer but in cooler temperatures when lips are more easily chapped. Why? The balm is enriched with a fruit and olive leaf-derived oil that boasts antioxidant and rejuvenation benefits – meaning lips are soft, hydrated, and smoother upon application. With its conditioning properties and sheer, never-shiny tint, it’s safe to say I’ve found my ultimate summer lip.

"wedding","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Toronto"", ""Ontario"", ""Canada""}","Tue 16 May 2023 20:35:02","The coronation of King Charles III was brimming with historical moments, but the Princess of Wales wearing a custom bejewelled headpiece instead of a tiara was not one I saw coming. There were whispers leading up to the day that Kate would forgo crown jewels at the request of the King because he wanted a more modest ceremony (not sure if we would call this event less opulent, but okay). And veering far from tradition, Kate chose a bespoke leafy-floral headpiece crafted from sequins, metallic beading and sparkling silver threadwork by Jess Collett X Alexander McQueen. It was a royal fashion moment for the books (as was the matching smaller version of the headpiece worn by Princess Charlotte), and one that has tipped off a trend of exquisite and elaborate bejewelled wedding headpieces as coveted accessory.  “I thought Catherine’s headpiece conveyed a youthful and whimsical vibe,” says Toronto-based accessory designer Blair Nadeau, founder and owner of Blair Nadeau Bridal Adornments, who is renowned for her exquisite jewellery, veils, hair accessories and crowns. “I literally squealed when I saw it. This accessory didn’t feel old and stuffy, it felt fresh. I loved the tiered leaf and floral motif and the doubled-banded style. The look is perfect for a wedding because it’s elegant and impactful and very modern feeling.”  Nadeau says the organic shape of Kate’s instantly iconic headpiece is what makes it easy and effortless for brides to wear. “We are still in a bit of a minimalist era but starting to see the emergence of softer silhouettes and more texture with three-dimensional details like floral embellishments and lace patterns,” she shares. “The silver tone provided an airy lightness that is very much happening now with accessories after years of bold gold designs.”  If you’re feeling the luxe headpiece vibe for your wedding day, Nadeau has a few thoughts on how to wear them. Pair a design like Kate’s with a light and airy dress with a fluid silhouette made from tulle, chiffon or lace. She also recommends keeping hair easy and not overly styled. “I actually love the juxtaposition of soft waves with a statement headpiece,” says Nadeau. “If you do wear it up, keep it soft and a little imperfect, not too sleek.”  As for adding other wedding accessories, keep it simple and classic. Kate opted for a pair of diamond and South Sea pearl drop earrings that belonged to Princess Diana, which Nadeau says worked because they complemented the motif of her headpiece. “I actually love a veil combined with a statement headpiece, but the trick is to keep it simple and minimal,” she says. “Always remember your wedding accessories are there to complement you and your dress.”  Bejewelled wedding headpieces to shop now  This bold trend is here to stay for several wedding seasons  The shape and finish of the Victoria headpiece is very much in step with the Princess of Wales’s style on Coronation day. It’s the perfect match for big, bold and volumized hair!  The Arielle headband by Jennifer Behr was first launched in 2010 and continues to be a runaway bestseller. It features hundreds of Swarovski-crystal-adorned leaves fastened to a silver ribbon-wrapped skinny headband.  The Millaray crown features a dramatic criss-cross design that creates a delicate and bold effect. Crafted from crystal beads, enamel and brass flowers, sterling-silver-plated wire and Mokuba silk ribbon, this piece is truly breathtaking.  The Cecilia headband is bedazzling hand-crafted custom piece that can take up to 16 weeks to receive from order date, so plan accordingly. This beauty is hanndmade from rhodium plating and is detailed with fresh water pearls and Swarovski crystals.  The Henri headband mixes pearls and crystals to create a maximum impact wedding accessory. This one would look amazing as a re-wear for any weddings or formal events on your upcoming calendar.  This is an amazing piece of hair jewellery that is very deco-inspired! It wraps around your head and is anchored by two dazzling leaf motifs on either side—so dramatic and so different!  We love the vintage vibe bow design of this glittering headband by designer Keren Wolf. This halo-style headpiece is easy to wear and pairs beautifully with easy, breezy wedding hair.

"wedding","2023-04-01","Not Discerned","{""Atlanta"", ""Georgia"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 16:43:18","There are several widely accepted rules for wedding speeches: Don’t talk about exes. Don’t dredge up drunken antics. And whatever you do, don’t wing it.  But a new etiquette question has recently emerged: Can you use AI to write them?  Couples and their loved ones are putting ChatGPT to the emotional Turing test, as they seek to give vows and toasts that are personal and eloquent but don’t rely on a writerly touch. What they’re finding is that AI can’t beat a human on the feelings front—phew!—but it can perhaps help prompt memories or create structure.  Ten days before her wedding, Kelly Tenn, 35, found herself on the planning website Joy, answering prompts from its free AI speechwriting tool, which relies on OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology.  “For me, there’s obviously this big craze around AI tools over the past few months, and I was a bit skeptical to try to use a tool like this,"" said Ms. Tenn, a brand-marketing executive for a cloud-technology company in San Francisco. She doesn’t find writing hard—“I work in content,"" she said—but for vows “it takes a little bit more creativity in how you articulate something that is summarizing your relationship over many years and years to come.""  Ms. Tenn used the product to create multiple versions of AI-generated vows, including prose “spoken like a friend"" and “Shakespearean-style verbiage"" (“So often have I pondered our love and asked, wherefrom hath thy love descended so unexpectedly?""). Ultimately she scrapped the drafts, which she found basic and nondescript, but she said using the tool helped her break out of writer’s block.  The tool also eased her woes about getting up in front of a crowd on her wedding day. “Public speaking is not something I prefer to do,"" Ms. Tenn said. “This is one of many ways to help lower the barrier and alleviate nerves.""  Write Your Own Vows Using AI  Let’s write vows to an imaginary spouse. Once you answer these questions, the AI tool ChatGPT will generate vows based on your responses.  Ahead of their April wedding, Jeff and Allison Hood of Atlanta used Provenance’s toast and vow builder, which launched in early 2023. It prompts each partner to share stories, memories and promises for their future spouse. Through the service, which costs $19.99, each partner can also view the relative length and tone of their significant others’ vows without seeing the contents.  “There was really nothing that didn’t sound like my authentic voice,"" said Mr. Hood, 34, a custom clothier. Since he’s “not a novelist,"" he was grateful that the tool presented his thoughts in a way that flowed well.  Ms. Hood, 32 and head of growth for a digital-marketing agency, kept a running list in her phone of all the things she loves about her partner since they started dating four years ago. “They’re just like ‘I stubbed my toe and he brought me a Band-Aid and I felt so special,’"" she said. “It wasn’t something I could actually say on my wedding day.""  Left to her own devices, Ms. Hood said her vows would have sounded as though they had been written by a second-grader: “Will you marry me? Check ‘yes’ or ‘no.’"" Reading what Provenance came up with, she thought, “‘Wow, I would have never worded it this way and it sounds so thoughtful—and the way that I actually feel.’""  Less than two weeks before giving a rehearsal-dinner toast for a best friend’s wedding, Randi Kramer, 29, thought: How do I capture nearly a decade of friendship in just a few minutes? Another friend suggested she try ToastWiz, a paid service for crafting speeches that uses AI.  “More than anything, it was a tool that got me past writer’s block,"" said Ms. Kramer, an associate editor at a publishing house in New York City. Thanks to prompts the form gave her—such as asking for adjectives to describe the couple and a favorite anecdote about the bride—Ms. Kramer was finally able “to get the juices flowing.""  She paid $30 for three speech drafts. “I was able to Frankenstein it together,"" she said, estimating that a third of what the chatbot produced made it into her final speech.  “I definitely didn’t tell anyone,"" she said, of using the service.  Julia Rosenson, 25, a software engineer in New York City, used Joy’s service to help write her maid of honor speech for her sister’s coming September wedding. While she’s found it to be “a fun little tool"" to play with, Ms. Rosenson said it should only be used for inspiration.  “It’s pretty hit or miss—mostly miss—just because they don’t know my sister at all,"" she said, “but they put together a whole story,"" adding that it was quite funny to read. “It generates anecdotes as if I were going to tell a story about my sister and her fiancé on a camping trip they never took, or some pivotal imaginary relationship moment,"" Ms. Rosenson said.  Joy’s CEO Vishal Joshi said the tool’s invented anecdotes should be seen as placeholders for personal material. “It will make up interesting stories where it could be like, ‘OK, a story quote over here would be nice,’"" he said.  Kyle and Sarah Kuo, both 26, of Tempe, Ariz., used Provenance to prepare for their April 2023 wedding. Ms. Kuo, a registered nurse at an outpatient family practice, especially liked the fact that you could cross-check your partner’s vows to make sure you were on the same page, tone-wise.  “You don’t want to put too many jokes in there if your partner is being serious and sentimental,"" she said.  For his part, Mr. Kuo, a director of operations at a production company, was just glad to have his time back.  “I would have had to Google ‘how to write your vows’ and read through, you know, nine articles,"" he said.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9zcGVjaWFscy93b3VsZC15b3UtdXNlLWFpLXRvLXdyaXRlLXlvdXItd2VkZGluZy12b3dzLXRoZXktZGlkLTExNjg0MjU0MzY0MjY2Lmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vc3BlY2lhbHMvd291bGQteW91LXVzZS1haS10by13cml0ZS15b3VyLXdlZGRpbmctdm93cy10aGV5LWRpZC9hbXAtMTE2ODQyNTQzNjQyNjYuaHRtbA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2022-03-01","Not Discerned","{""Kiev"", ""Kiev"", ""Ukraine""}","Tue 16 May 2023 22:21:00","Ukrainian troops train to use commercial drones to spot and target enemy forces in Kharkiv Oblast in August. Wolfgang Schwan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  In the days after Russia's invasion last year, Ukrainian forces need help targeting Russian troops.  One Ukrainian artillery unit relied on help from Ukrainian civilians to guide their strikes.  Using repurposed drones, cameras and phones, and Google Maps, that unit put rounds on its targets.  Hobby drones and Google Maps were designed to enhance human life, not to end it, but when Russian tank columns seemed to be closing in on Kyiv in the days after Russia's attack on February 24, 2022, desperate Ukrainian defenders found they had two unlikely assets.  Col. Oleh Shevchuk, commander of Ukraine's 43rd Artillery Brigade, and Col. Serhiy Ogerenko, the brigade's chief of staff, told Ukrainian media that they were able to use civilian drones and Google Maps, sometimes with the help of Ukrainian civilians, to locate and target Russian forces in the early days of the war.  At the time, Ukrainian gunners faced the problem of hitting Russian vehicles — moving targets — without trained forward observers to estimate where the vehicle would be when the shell landed.  ""That's why we needed 'eyes,'"" Ogerenko said. ""We called civilians and asked, 'Do you see this section of the road? If a shell hits in a minute and a half, can you tell us at least roughly where it exploded?' Then the person would describe the place of the explosion, and we would open a Google map and see, yes, there is such a place behind the vegetable gardens.""  A woman uses her smartphone in a house damaged by shelling in southeastern Kyiv in March 2022. GENYA SAVILOV/AFP via Getty Images  Civilians also offered to use their hobby drones as scouts and artillery spotters. DJI Mavic quadcopters — nicknamed ""wedding drones"" because that is what they were used to record before the war — proved invaluable to the 43rd Artillery Brigade.  ""They provided the picture,"" Shevchuk said, according to a translation of the interview. ""4G, WhatsApp, a video call — the cameraman picked up, saw something, took off his phone, and said, 'look what I have.' I looked at it and said, 'hold it. We're going to shoot now.' It was convenient.""  Story continues  Drones — both military-designed and civilian models — are among the most vital assets for troops on both sides of the war. Ukrainian and Russian drones prowl the skies constantly, looking for enemy positions and movements, as well as for artillery batteries, supply depots, and command posts.  Shevchuk recounted how ""one guy from a gas station even gave us access to his camera."" Rather than explain the situation to Ukrainian gunners, the owner told them, ""'here's the password. See for yourself,'"" Shevchuk recalled. ""That's how we saw our first live target — a column of Chechens near Novyi Bykiv [37 miles from Kyiv] heading towards Kyiv. So we 'met' them three kilometers [1.9 miles] further.""  A drone operator corrects Ukrainian 82mm mortar fire toward Russian positions in the Donetsk region in April. SERGEY SHESTAK/AFP via Getty Images  Sometimes Ukrainian forces would get indications that Russian troops were in a village, but not their precise location. ""We open a Google map, see a store, see its phone number, and dial it,"" said Shevchuk, who described a typical conversation:  ""Good evening, we are from Ukraine! Do you have any Katsaps [Ukrainian slur for Russians] in the village?"" ""Yes."" ""Where?"" ""Behind Grandma Hanna's house."" ""What house does Grandma Hanna have?"" ""Well, everyone knows her!""  ""So you talk to people a little bit and realize where everything is,"" Shevchuk added.  This isn't the only example of how Ukrainian civil society is using consumer technology to enhance Ukraine's military capabilities. To cope with waves of Russian long-range drones penetrating deep into Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainian military has formed mobile air-defense teams equipped with short-range anti-aircraft weapons.  Ordinary citizens can use cellphone apps to report drone sightings to a central database, which can then alert mobile air-defense units.  Ukrainian troops fire an 2S7 Pion howitzer at Russian positions near Bakhmut in March. Muhammed Enes Yildirim/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  Ukrainians using video cameras and cellphones to call in artillery fire on Russians forces as they pass by is a bizarre, almost comical, illustration of how a modern war can play out in an urban environment. But it also shows how much danger those civilians faced from invaders intent on defeating Ukraine's military and then repressing the Ukrainian public.  Russian troops and Wagner Group mercenaries have been accused of numerous atrocities against Ukrainian civilians, and Moscow has clamped down on Ukrainians living in areas it still controls in an effort to prevent attacks by partisans or special-operations forces. Anyone suspected of providing intelligence to Ukraine's devastatingly effective artillery could expect little mercy.  ""We lost contact with many people, and some said: 'That's it, I'm turning off my phone, deleting all my contacts. There are Russians in the next house,'"" Shevchuk said of civilians his forces were in contact with. ""Some people immediately said: 'I'm scared, don't ask me any questions.'

Their ceremony was held at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, and members of the public flocked to the streets in their thousands to share their well-wishes for the couple.  However, behind the scenes, the scale of the royal wedding was having an emotional impact on the bride.  “I was frightened of walking down the aisle,” Autumn told Hello! Magazine at the time.  The ceremony was not as high-profile as other royal nuptials, but their guest list of 300 still included the likes of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, then-Prince Charles and Prince Harry.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Wed 17 May 2023 06:00:00","AN invitation to a wedding is a bit of a two-edged sword.  There’s the compliment of being asked to celebrate the nuptials of friends, making you feel a tiny bit important, or at least, definitely not a c-lister.  The c-listers are relegated to the ‘insult’ otherwise known as the ‘afters’ where sandwiches are served and you might be offloaded with a slice of wedding cake.  The afters really are something of an after-thought for people that don’t make the grade but can’t be completely forgotten about either.  Are they expected to give a gift to the couple? It’s a bit of a minefield.  Thankfully, most of my friends are not the marrying kind so I haven’t been encumbered with the diplomatic shenanigans involved in trying to decide on a gift versus cash. I believe cash is king. (There’s no point in buying a toaster or some other kitchen implement for a couple that will most likely have been living together for years and have everything they need.)  But what is really tricky is the invitation to a destination wedding. It’s all very well if you decide to get married on a beach in Bali in flip flops and a floaty white dress. But think of the guests.  A couple may find it hard to believe, but travelling for a wedding is often seen as hassle and as expensive.  It requires taking some of your annual leave from work, which you might really resent, having hoped to save your days off to go on a decent holiday of your own choice.  You really may not want to have to rock up somewhere in Italy for a wedding event that, in the old days, used to just take place over the course of a day.  It’s downright cheeky to assume that your friends and family will welcome a wedding abroad. While close family members have no choice but to follow the couple to a hired villa in France or wherever, friends will be counting the cost.  You’re talking a few grand (at least €2,000) which is a big ask for a guest. There’s all the logistics of getting from the airport to the wedding venue which might be hours away, somewhere deep in the Italian countryside.  Scenic and romantic? Certainly, but far from practical.  Whatever happened to the Saturday wedding in a hotel serving beef or salmon? Now, folk want to emulate celebrities with their fancy notions involving hiring a wedding planner and dragging their mates abroad because ‘it’s all about the experience’.  Yes, making memories can be expensive.  But now you have the perfect excuse to decline an invitation to a wedding in some far-flung place. It’s our old enemy – the carbon footprint.  Can you really justify a flight when at least 2.4% of global emissions come from aviation?  Together with other gases and the water vapour trails produced by aircraft, the industry is responsible for around 5% of global warming.  While that may not seem like a massive contributor, only a small percentage of the world flies frequently. It’s for the relatively rich and indulgent.  Put that on your wedding invitation refusal and you should be off the hook. (On the other hand, if you have plenty of time on your hands, you could indulge in ‘slow travel’ using boats and trains and coaches to get to the celebrations). Now that could be a great and memorable trip. But time may not be on your side.  Most of us are wage slaves unable to dedicate days and days to just travelling to a destination.  According to a BBC report, a return flight from London to San Francisco emits around 5.5 tonnes of CO2 per person, more than twice the emissions produced by a family car in a year and about half of the average carbon footprint of someone living in the UK.  Even a fairly short return flight from London to Berlin emits three times the emissions saved from a year of recycling.  A study involving 29 international students asked them to rate the importance of different flights they had taken. Just 58% of the flights were rated ‘very important’ or ‘important’.  And really, how important is a flight to the Caribbean for a wedding party?  Unless you’re close family, you’d be justified in turning down the invitation – on environmental grounds.  Some people compensate for the emissions from their flights by buying a carbon offset. But this is a bit of a cod. Trees, for example, need years to grow enough to reabsorb the carbon from your flight, and there’s no guarantee they’ll be left standing long enough to counteract your flight emissions.  That kind of thing is for the wealthy who continue contributing to climate change, offsetting, but not changing their behaviour.  The solution to destination weddings? Elope. Just the two of you.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjaG9saXZlLmllL2Nvcmt2aWV3cy9hcmlkLTQxMTQwMzk5Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Carl, 56, was recently diagnosed with stomach cancer which meant the couple had to speed up the timeline.  Sophie, 30, from Stanton Harcourt, and Thames Water employee Shane, 26, from Sutton, and got together at Bartholomew School in Eynsham when Sophie was 13.  The bride recalled: ""I’ve been with Shane half my life but we were planning to get married in a few years’ time in Turkey.

He is my absolute rock.  ""And having spent so much of my life without him, I just knew I wanted my dad to be there at my wedding.”  Realising that she had so much to organise in a short time, Sophie appealed for help on community Facebook group Witney Spotted.

Alyssa and Duncan were matched on the experiment together and after a series of ups and downs, Duncan eventually called it a day on their relationship.  Talking about her MAFS Australia wedding, Alyssa told Hello! Magazine she told Duncan she was a single parent and was disappointed it was never aired for viewers to see.  “I don’t know why they didn’t show it, it totally perpetuates the stigma around single parents,” she said. “It was suddenly revealed like, ‘I have a child. I have a child’.  “And then people were like, ‘When did she even tell him? When is she going to tell him?’ And I said, ‘Well guys, I was really upfront and honest, I told him straight away!’ I literally do not know why they didn’t show it,” Alyssa explained about their wedding on MAFS Australia.  Duncan has recently moved on from Alyssa and is now in a relationship with his co-star Evelyn Ellis. The happy couple announced the news in a Honesty Box session with 9Entertainment and it was incredibly wholesome.  “All of a sudden we went on a couple of nights, and some of the warm fuzzy feelings happened in my stomach and I thought, ‘What’s this? How we going here?’ Then one thing led to another,” Duncan said explaining how they started dating.

Kelly Piquet ended up attending the wedding alone, posting pictures of herself in a red, feathered dress on Instagram.  1 Piquet enjoyed the wedding despite Verstappen's absence. Credit: Kelly Piquet via Instagram  She titled the post “Lady in red” but did not explain her boyfriend’s absence from the event.  The answer can be found on Twitch where Verstappen was streaming himself racing in the virtual 24 Hours of Nurburgring.  The current world champion F1 driver was racing as part of his virtual F1 Team Redline streaming with another member Chris Lulham.  Verstappen apparently decided to join the competition at the last minute after Lulham had complained about the amount of work he had to do for his upcoming exams.  Lulham was on the call talking with Verstappen while the F1 driver took part in the race.  During the race Lulham tries to defend himself saying: “If I had raced I would have had to rock up with like five hours break.”  However, Verstappen quickly cuts him off saying: “I cancelled a wedding for it.”  Lulham suggests that Verstappen was happy to cancel his plans though saying: “Don’t tell me this isn’t what you’d rather be doing.”  To which Verstappen replies: “I love sim racing, but sometimes you have to think about the greater good.”  Verstappen has previously shown that he is almost as passionate about virtual F1 racing as he is about the real deal.  He slammed Le Mans Virtual’s organisers after issues with the servers prevented him from finishing.  Recently, he installed a full F1 simulator in his £12million private jet so that he can practise on the go.  Despite Verstappen’s absence, Piquet appears to have had a great time at the wedding, with a fan commenting on her post that Piquet even managed to catch the bouquet.

Princess Anne's daughter tied the knot with Mike Tindall on 30 July 2011 at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh, stepping out of the car with her father Captain Mark Phillips wearing a gown by Stewart Parvin, one of her grandmother's favourite couturiers. The long ivory silk dress featured a Duchess satin trim and a chevron pleated corseted bodice, which she teamed with a fine tulle veil secured in place with a precious Greek tiara known as Princess Andrew's Meander Tiara.

Zara and Mike got married in Edinburgh in 2011  The honeysuckles on the 'something borrowed' piece from Prince Philip's mother Princess Alice of Battenberg are said to symbolise pure happiness, while the laurel wreath design was used as a Greek symbol of triumph – both fitting for Olympic equestrian Zara's big day.  For the royal wedding, mother-of-the-bride Princess Anne looked striking in a peach pleated dress, cream and pink embroidered jacket and an elaborate lace and flower detail fascinator, while the Queen also chose a pastel pink ensemble accessorised with a beautiful diamond lapel brooch.  © Getty Anne wore a pink pleated mother of the bride dress  Zara wasn't the only member of the royal family to turn to Queen Elizabeth's jewellery collection for her wedding day. Princess Anne borrowed Queen Mary's Fringe Tiara – worn by her mother in 1947 – for her nuptials in 1973, which was then loaned to Princess Beatrice for her low-key pandemic wedding with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in 2020.  Meanwhile, Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik tiara, and the Duchess of Sussex wore Queen Mary's diamond bandeau tiara – a last-minute change after originally being offered the late Princess Diana's glittering headpiece.  It is not known who inherited the accessories after the Queen passed away in September 2022. It's possible they will continue to be passed down and may now belong to Princess Anne, who already loaned tiaras to her daughter Zara and former daughter-in-law Autumn Phillips.

Quoting from the comedy Borat, he recalls, ""My first thought was, 'Wa-wa-wee-wa!' I didn't know what to think. She looked incredible – stunning!"" Familiar faces from Jono And Ben, 7 Days and Funny Girls, the lovebirds – known together as comedy duo Two Hearts – married on 30 December 2022 at Nadia Lim's Royalburn Farm in the Crown Ranges near Arrowtown.  A-list guests, including Hilary Barry, Rose Matafeo, Chris Parker, Brynley Stent, Tom Sainsbury and Hayley Sproull, descended on the Queenstown-Lakes District for three fun-filled days of festivities. Laura laughs, ""We seriously considered eloping because we felt huge pressure to have this amazing wedding!""  The blooming gorgeous bride gets a cuddle from Rose.  Fortunately, the spectacular day went off without a hitch – and Laura, 32, and Joseph, 34, are now Zooming in to chat about it from Australia after sell-out gigs at the Melbourne Comedy Festival. By the time you read this, they'll have performed in Wellington. And this week, it's Auckland's turn to see their show Til Death Do Us Hearts, which they describe as ""an intimate evening of songs about love, life and maintaining a successful relationship with your co-worker"". But back to the wedding… The fun-loving couple wanted their big day to be full of excitement and surprises for everyone, so it started with a laugh-a-minute bus ride to the venue, featuring some of their favourite pop songs and hilarious mock commentary from a voiceover artist who introduces the fireworks at Disneyland. Joseph jokes he spent ""five times longer"" on this part of the wedding than he did his vows! Former Seven Sharp reporter Laura has stayed good friends with Nadia ever since the 2019 season of Dancing With The Stars and says the MasterChef judge's farm, with its stunning views out to Lake Wakatipu, made for a ""special"" venue. She adds, ""I went to Nadia's the night before and they've got a little apartment I stayed in. Nadia was heavily pregnant at the time, but she still made me dinner, which was so cute!"" Laughing, Joseph jokes, ""It was just a My Food Bag.""  The bride with pregnant pal Nadia and her husband Carlos Bagrie.  The ceremony was sweet and simple – the only real tradition they followed was Laura spending the night apart from her groom. She explains, ""We spend our lives so deeply intertwined. This was the one thing we could do to be like, 'OK, let's build this up!'"" Being reunited at the altar was a powerful moment. An uncharacteristically serious Joseph says, ""We're always going to treasure that memory."" They both get emotional recalling groomsmen Paul Williams (Taskmaster NZ) and Nic Sampson (The Brokenwood Mysteries) bursting into tears. Joseph adds, ""I really like that we made a lot of our friends cry to a Jason Derulo song!"" True to their nature, a few details were left to the last minute. Joseph says, ""I remember I emailed the suit makers, 'Hello, I'd like one wedding suit please,' and they replied, 'When's your wedding?' When I told them it was in a month, they were like, 'But we have to make it in Italy!'"" Fortunately, it arrived three days before they left for Queenstown.  The bridal party (from left): Alice Harbourne, Simone Nathan,  Steph Badham, Eli Matthewson, Brynley Stent and Zara Cormack.  Similarly, Laura says, ""We both wrote our vows the night before the wedding."" She'd sought help from newlywed comedian Chris, who told her, ""The vows will just come to you."" She says she and Joseph often have to write jokes under pressure for work, adding, ""That's when our best stuff comes out!"" The reception was under a huge tent decorated with fairy lights and flowers. There were games, speeches, drinks and  a vegetarian dinner. As for the first dance, Laura says, ""We didn't do a big, choreographed number, which a few people were expecting, but we did a cute sway side to side."" The party went on into the early hours of the morning, with dancing, singing and a saxophonist playing alongside the DJ. ""It was really going off!"" Laura exclaims delightedly. And then it was round two of partying the next day for New Year's Eve, with the newlyweds heading off on honeymoon to Hawaii. ""It rocked – I had the best time!"" declares Laura, prompting Joseph to ask, ""The honeymoon or the wedding?"" ""Both!"" Laura quickly chirps, adding that Disneyland was also on the itinerary – a visit that inspired a song in Til Death Do Us Hearts, which is part of the New Zealand International Comedy Festival.  The newlyweds honeymooned in Disneyland.  The pair first performed as a duo, but just as friends, back in 2017, with the final song in their act being about how they would never end up together. Now they're performing in Aotearoa for the first time as husband and wife, although they insist not much has changed. ""We're still renting with a flatmate and our lives are still very much the same, but it's nice to call him my husband now and to celebrate the milestones,"" says Laura. Joseph agrees, explaining that the main reason for them getting married was to create ""memories of such a special day with family and friends"". ""The lead-up to the wedding was so stressful,"" adds Laura. ""We thought, 'What are we doing?!' But then we had the wedding and were like, 'Hell, yeah, that was absolutely worth it!'"" Clearly still besotted with each other, Laura and Joseph pause when asked what's coming up for them. Laura is pensive. ""I guess we're in a phase of deciding what to do next with our lives,"" she reflects, adding that sell-out Aussie shows and one of their videos going viral in Europe have made moving overseas a temptation. International audiences are very vocal, tells Laura.  You can see their love for real in Til Death Do Us Hearts.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5vd3RvbG92ZS5jby5uei9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2VkZGluZ3MvbGF1cmEtZGFuaWVsLWpvc2VwaC1tb29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTQ3MDUx0gFaaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubm93dG9sb3ZlLmNvLm56L2FtcC9saWZlc3R5bGUvd2VkZGluZ3MvbGF1cmEtZGFuaWVsLWpvc2VwaC1tb29yZS13ZWRkaW5nLTQ3MDUx?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Of course, that required a little trickery.  Gadsby married producer Jenney Shamash in January 2021. In an April 2021 social media post announcing their union, the couple said they felt “chuffed about it.” (Chuffed is British slang for “very pleased.”)  “For the record: this is me gushing,” Gadsby wrote in the caption. “I am full of very positive feelings. This is a nice story.”  Get the Daily Brief The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you. The news you care about, reported on by the people who care about you.  In their new special, which Gadsby describes as “a feel-good show,” the comedian shares more details about their wedding, including the story behind their hilariously non-traditional novelty wedding cake.  “We wanted to trick a Christian baker into making a gay wedding cake,” Gadsby explains in Something Special, “and it worked.”  Gadsby recently shared a photo of the cake in question on their Instagram. It features a massive shark about to devour two adorable otters swimming serenely side-by-side.  “I was like, ‘Nah, mate, that’s not a wedding cake. I’m turning 10,’” Gadsby recalls in their special. “Easy. So gullible. Will believe anything, Christians.”  Cakes have, of course, become one of the most unexpected battlegrounds in the fight for LGBTQ+ equality. (Just imagine what Harvey Milk or veterans of the Stonewall uprising would’ve said if you told them that, in 2023, we would be suing bakers over cakes.)  In probably the most famous instance of cake discrimination, Jack Phillips, the anti-gay owner of Colorado’s Masterpiece Cakeshop, sued the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC) in 2015 after it told him that his refusal to provide an LGBTQ+ couple’s wedding cake violated the state’s law prohibiting businesses open to the public from discriminating against customers on the basis of race, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Phillips, but did not rule on the question of whether he had a First Amendment right to refuse to make a gay wedding cake.  Phillips was sued again in 2018, this time by a trans customer for whom he refused to make a cake celebrating both her birthday and her anniversary of coming out as trans. In 2021, a Denver judge ruled that Phillips illegally discriminated against Autumn Scardina when he refused to make the cake. Earlier this year, the Colorado Court of Appeals again ruled against Phillips in the case.  More recently, in Florida, a Publix grocery store refused to write “Trans People Deserve Joy” on a cake for a trans nonprofit organization. The company later apologized, claiming that employees at the Orland-area store were mistaken in believing that writing a trans-affirming message on a cake was against corporate policy.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxnYnRxbmF0aW9uLmNvbS8yMDIzLzA1L3F1ZWVyLWNvbWVkaWFuLWhhbm5haC1nYWRzYnktdHJpY2tlZC1hLWNocmlzdGlhbi1iYWtlcnktaW50by1tYWtpbmctdGhlaXItd2VkZGluZy1jYWtlL9IBAA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The Bell Tower on 34th has also opened this new boutique, smaller outdoor ballroom space to offer smaller wedding parties a more intimate space that encourages close connection between guests.  More information is available at https://thebelltoweron34th.com  Responding to the trend for more intimate weddings, where the bride and groom really get the opportunity to share their special day with their loved ones, The Bell Tower on 34th has created an open-air, outdoor ballroom that is suitable for small parties and for micro weddings with 50 guests or fewer. The event planners at The Bell Tower on 34th believe that, for small weddings, their new outdoor ballroom is both open and airy, which creates a sense of spaciousness, with room to eat, drink and dance, without feeling cavernous or empty.  With their new outdoor ballroom space, The Bell Tower on 34th can still offer guests the same high-quality personalized service that characterizes the larger weddings they have become known for.

This category includes everything from appetizers that circulate during the cocktail hour to late-night snacks — and, of course, the wedding cake.  Given the tradition of the bride and groom cutting the cake together, many couples are very particular about their wedding cake. That means they're often willing to pay a bit extra for a truly show-stopping creation. However, the most expensive slice of wedding cake ever sold probably isn't something you'd want to consider eating — given that it was over 80 years old at the time of sale.  Back in 1998, two individuals in San Francisco made Guinness World Records history. Their feat? Shelling out a staggering $29,900 U.S. dollars in order to purchase a single piece of wedding cake, packaged in a box and sold at auction. Though the crew at Sotheby's figured the sweet treat from decades past would fetch somewhere between $500 and $1,000, Benjamin and Amanda Yin were willing to pay a whole lot more for the item.  In truth, they were buying a slice of history. The piece of the cake in question was served at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1937. The couple relished the romance that the purchase represented. They were willing to pay top dollar for a slice of cake that they would never even get to taste because of its connection to the historic event.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc2hlZC5jb20vMTI4ODA3OS9tb3N0LWV4cGVuc2l2ZS1zbGljZS13ZWRkaW5nLWNha2Utc29sZC1kZWNhZGVzLW9sZC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Target  Shop now: $35; target.com  The heels are available in sizes six through 12 — plus half sizes — along with two widths and six colors, like neutral beige and summer-ready magenta. The mule slip-on style features a square toe, two supportive double-braided straps, and a faux alligator textured block heel that one reviewer deemed “so easy to walk in.” The thick 3.25-inch round heel offers more support than a stiletto, making them comfier and easier to stand on for longer periods of time. Although they’re an open-back style, the double straps offer more stability by holding the foot in place as opposed to the looser feeling that can occur with a single strap shoe.  The Basil Heeled Sandals received more than 690 five-star reviews, with many commenting on how comfy they are. Shoppers are highlighting that they’re wearable beyond just one event and are “perfect for anything casual or formal,” according to one person.“The height is perfect for capris, skirts, dresses, and jeans,” another reviewer mentioned, so you can wear them with low-lift outfits without feeling too over-the-top.

Many brides fantasize about walking down the aisle in a gown that looks like it belongs on the set of “Bridgerton” or “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.” This fantasy can now become a reality thanks to Allure Bridals’ new line of dresses. The premier wedding designer is collaborating with Shondaland to create gowns that are fit for a Queen herself … Queen Charlotte, that is.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Inspired by the sumptuous gowns in the Bridgerverse, these gowns will be a modern and wearable take on the dresses we drool over on “Bridgerton” and “Queen Charlotte.”  The Queen Charlotte gowns from Allure Bridals will be designed by none other than Shondaland’s Lyn Paolo. Paola has worked on many Shonda Rhimes’ projects, including “How to Get Away with Murder” and “Scandal,” and most recently served as Costume Designer for “Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.”  “I love the worlds that [Shonda] creates and it is an absolute delight to fill those worlds with beautiful costumes,” Lyn Paolo, Shondaland’s creative director and designer, said in a press release. “Now I am excited to help design beautiful gowns inspired by the world she has created for today’s beautiful brides.”  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  Though the collaboration shared Paolo’s sketches of the gowns ahead of their release, the Allure Bridals x Shondaland wedding gowns won’t be available until December 2023. The dresses are moderately priced, starting at around $1,600. (According to The Knot, the average wedding dress was $1,900 in 2022.) There are more luxe options in the Shondaland line that can range up to $3,000, so brides can find the dress that best suits their budget.  As you can see from the sketches of the gowns, these dresses bring the drama. Forget minimalism and austere design: These wedding dresses are designed with romance and royalty in mind.  Allure Bridals x Shondaland  “The intricate details, lavish fabrics, and timeless elegance of Queen Charlotte and the ton’s fashion are a perfect fit for our bridal gowns, and we can’t wait to unveil this special collection to brides around the world,” says Kelly Crum, CEO of Allure Bridals.  The new line of Allure Bridals x Shondaland dresses can be found at bridal stores worldwide at the end of this year. Grooms not included.  This story originally appeared on Simplemost.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""WestChesterTownship"", ""Ohio"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:50:00","A wedding bouquet is perhaps the most important and iconic accessory a bride wears to the big day. Designed to tie in bridal attire with the ceremony aesthetic, this arrangement of florals brings a whimsical touch to the bride's aesthetic. Designers can get quite creative and create bouquets big and small for brides to walk down the aisle with that feature a wild melange of blooms or just a singular kind of flower. While the types of florals used within a bouquet can vary greatly, there are a few more popular blooms and filler flowers used in this wedding arrangement. However, these are usually accented with less common ones for intrigue.  ""Floral designers today strive for innovation, especially in the era of social media,"" shares floral designer Shean Matthew Strong. ""It is crucial to create floral art pieces that truly showcase their talent. As a designer, incorporating unique elements is always a safe bet. This could be as simple as including herbs like mint, rosemary, or lavender in a bouquet, or something more captivating like a Hellebore, anthurium, or garden roses.""  Meet the Expert Shean Matthew Strong is a wedding and event floral designer. He is the owner and founder of Shean Strong Design.  Want to learn what are the most popular florals found in the wedding bouquet? Read ahead to learn about standout blooms and filler flowers often used in this iconic arrangement.  Photo by Amy and Stuart Photography  Popular Bouquet Flowers  Larger flowers with structure and plenty of petals are often the primary florals you will find in a wedding bouquet. One of the most popular types of flowers used in all kinds of weddings arrangements are roses. Found in hues ranging from bright whites to light pinks to deep reds, a rose is a timeless wedding bloom that can help your bouquet tie into your palette. A commonly used alternative to this bloom is ranunculus. These florals can add texture and movement to a bouquet thanks to their ruffly petals.  Show-stopping peonies are just as popular as roses, thanks to their distinct colorful petals. However, this temperamental flower only really blooms from April to June, so just springtime couples can utilize them in their bouquet designs. Large dahlias are a popular alternative for couples who want this face flower from mid-summer through the fall. For a hardy bloom that can ground an arrangement, floral designers also like to turn to hydrangea.  Looking for a lighter floral with movement? ""When aiming for a bouquet with a delicate fragrance and captivating beauty, Japanese Sweet Pea is a perfect choice,"" notes Strong. ""Its gentle scent and flouncy petals form a soft and feminine shape that is both timeless and romantic."" Long-stemmed anemone are fun to incorporate for a modern bouquet, while orchids are popular if a bride wants to create a cascading bouquet.  Certain flowers are more common in bouquets of a single variety. Calla lilies are an elegant, trumpet-shaped bloom often found solo and tied with a beautiful ribbon for a bridal accessory. Lily of the valley is also popular for this style of arrangement.  Photo by Lucy Cuneo  Popular Filler Flowers  While certain blooms stand out as the face flowers of a bouquet, other florals and greenery are incorporated to add dimension to these arrangements. In fact, some of these blooms can be the star of the show. ""A flower that is often underrated but can add depth and movement to arrangements is the lisianthus,"" says Strong. ""When used skillfully, the color variations in its petals allow this once-considered 'filler flower' to take on the role of a 'dancing flower,' bringing the much desired sense of movement to bouquets.""  Another popular wedding filler flower of the moment is baby's breath. With light white blooms and plenty of volume, baby's breath is commonly used throughout wedding arrangements. While normally a filler, you can find modern brides and bridesmaids carrying bouquets of this flower on its own.  For smaller blooms, carnations are commonly used as accents to a bouquet. Since they are available year-round and are quite durable, they are a safe bet to include in your arrangement. Spray roses are also a nice addition when looking for a petite floral.  ""Don't hesitate to experiment with unique textures,"" advises Strong. ""Eucalyptus can provide interesting colors and shapes, clematis adds a touch of garden charm, dates create a cascading effect, and hyacinths offer a cluster of texture and color. Embracing a variety of flowers can elevate the overall appeal of your floral designs.""","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vcG9wdWxhci1mbG93ZXJzLXVzZWQtd2VkZGluZy1ib3VxdWV0cy03NDk4NTU40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Grande, who has a dedicated skin on Fortnite, shared the beautiful moment with fans via her Instagram story on May 15. Gomez and the beautiful Grande tied the knot in an exclusive ceremony in their Montecito home on May 15, 2021. On the wedding day, the couple stuck with a minimalist ceremony with just over ten people. Due to the private ceremony and the singer’s reticence to share personal moments, the snap is receiving a heartwarming response from fans.  Ariana Grande Celebrates 2nd Wedding Anniversary  In honor of Ariana Grande’s 2nd wedding anniversary, the Dangerous Woman singer shared a photo of herself and her husband. The adorable photo taken on their wedding day showed the lovebirds smiling as they embraced and shared a kiss. Meanwhile, Grande made a few alterations to the wedding photo. The Bang Bang singer wrote “2” on the black and white photo to signify how long they were married. In addition, she put a love symbol under the number. Grande also wrote “(3.5 together)” to signify how long she and Dalton Gomez have been together. According to Capital FM, Ariana Grande’s husband proposed to her about a year after they started dating in January 2020. The lovestruck media personality also wrote “I love him so” above the picture to celebrate her love for the realtor.  Dalton Gomez Is a Real Estate Agent  According to E! News, Dalton Gomez is a Californian native who grew up in San Bernardino. What’s more, Gomez is a real estate agent who sells houses around California. Gomez works for the Aaron Kirman Group and has sold houses for prominent figures, including actor Kunal Nayyar. Incidentally, the 7 Rings singer met her husband while house hunting. Based on insider information, the 29-year-old wanted to buy a house away from Los Angeles, and her team recruited Gomez. Grande was instantly smitten and asked for a private meeting.  The real estate agent is also musically inclined and used to dance until he moved to selling homes in California. In addition, before meeting her, Ariana Grande’s husband shared several mutual friends with her. The dog lover is friends with Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber’s manager, Scooter Braun.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 23:19:05","Thank you for supporting our journalism. This article is available exclusively for our subscribers, who help fund our work at the Chicago Tribune.  “Ask Anna” is a sex column. Because of the nature of the topic, some columns contain language some readers may find graphic.  Dear Anna,  Advertisement  I’m currently planning my wedding to the wonderful man of my dreams. The process itself is less than thrilling but we’re working together as a team to tackle all the little logistical things and hurdles. A problem that I didn’t anticipate, however, is the feelings I’m having when people RSVP no — in particular, only one person from my family is coming, my sister. I love that I’ll be surrounded by friends on my big day, but I can’t help but feel hurt that my family, who I thought would show up for me, isn’t coming. I’ve certainly been invited to weddings that I wasn’t able to attend for financial or scheduling or COVID reasons, so I know it’s likely not personal, but it feels personal. How can I deal with this and focus on what truly matters — that I’m going to celebrate the love of my life? — Being Rigid In Demanding Expectations  Dear BRIDE,  Advertisement  First off, congrats on snagging the man of your dreams! It’s not everyday that you find someone worth spending your life with, so big ups to you two — I wish you every happiness.  It’s totally valid to feel hurt that people you care about can’t make it to your big day. Weddings are, in many ways, extremely loaded events and we attach way more meaning, disappointment and weight than they deserve. That’s not your fault — society tells us that this one day is THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF OUR LIVES. How can we not fall short of such a ridiculous ideal? (We can’t.)  And, really, it’s just a party. A very expensive party.  Remember also that weddings are a giant, love-fueled jigsaw puzzle, and sometimes the pieces just don’t fit perfectly for everyone. (Sometimes not even for you.)  So, how do you deal with the hurt feelings without letting it hinder the love fest that awaits you and your future spouse? Here are a few tips:  Allow yourself to grieve: Let yourself feel all the things you’re feeling. Whether you’re hurt, pissed off, depressed or perhaps all of those things at once, the fastest way to deal with feelings is to simply feel them. Don’t push them away or shove them down. Open yourself to the pain, let it core and dismantle you. Then, once the storm has finished raging inside of you, dust yourself off and keep going. Feelings are always temporary. They pass. Remembering that will help you when you’re feeling the lowest lows.  Something that helped me when I was grieving the death of my father (admittedly somewhat different than your conundrum but not entirely) was to set aside five minutes a day, in the morning usually, to just think about him. Sometimes I would journal but usually I would just ugly-cry. When I allowed myself the space to feel the full weight and depth of my agony, I was surprised at how quickly the feelings moved on. Eventually, I only had to do the ritual every other day, then once a week, and now I do it only very occasionally, on his birthday and death day. You might try a similar ritual to feel the pain and disappointment you’re experiencing around your family.  Embrace the sisterly love: Then, practice a little gratitude for the family that is coming. Your sister’s got your back and will be there to celebrate with you. That’s not nothing. Plus, you two can bond even more during this special time, which will make your relationship closer.  Advertisement  Remember other ways your fam has shown up for you: When I’m feeling especially disappointed by someone who’s important to me — and literally everyone is disappointed by their families at some point! — I try to remember all the other ways they’ve shown up for me in the past, whether it was offering encouragement, sharing time or space with me, buying a book, being there for me during a hard time or even giving me cash when I desperately needed it.  People show their love in vastly different ways at vastly different times — love isn’t a one-and-done thing. It moves. So, while it stings that this particular time certain people can’t show up for you, it doesn’t mean they never have or never will again.  It’s not you, it’s them: As you said yourself, people have their reasons for not attending, and most of the time, it has nothing to do with you. Life gets in the way, and that’s OK. Just remember that their absence doesn’t mean they don’t care about you. Tell yourself a better story.  Quality over quantity: Spend a little time fixating on the amazing friends and loved ones who are coming to your wedding. They’re the ones who’ll be dancing the night away with you, toasting with you and sharing in all your wedded bliss. That’s worth celebrating.  In queer parlance, we call them chosen family — they’re our ride-or-dies, they show up for us in the middle of the night, they bring us food when we’re sick, they read and edit our sexts, they love us unequivocally when our family or society has rejected us because of who we love or who we are. It’s a bond more powerful than blood because it’s a choice. A daily, intentional f— yes! Honor those people in your life. Let them be your family.  Virtual love: If some family members can’t physically be there, you could also consider setting up a livestream or video chat to include them in the festivities. That way, they can still share in the joy of your big day.  Advertisement  Keep perspective: At the end of the day, your wedding is a celebration of the love between you and your soon-to-be spouse. As long as you two are there, that’s what truly counts. The greatest gift of all is that you’re marrying the love of your life! And nobody can take that joy from you.  Happy planning, BRIDE!

"wedding","2021-11-06","Not Discerned","{""NewOrleans"", ""Louisiana"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:10:00","On Matalin ""Matty"" Carville's very first day of work at New Orleans City Hall, she met the man she was meant to be with; but it happened to be his last day of work there. Luckily, she later reconnected with Sam Joel at a co-worker’s going away party. Or, maybe it wasn’t luck. “A psychic had predicted this meeting, in detail, to me,” Matty shares. The psychic also told her that Matty and her soulmate had been split from the same atom and met countless times before in previous lifetimes. This lifetime was to become the one they'd got married in.  Even though she certainly knew Sam was the one, Matty didn't know the proposal was coming. “Sam is a master of surprise,” she says. “We got engaged on the rooftop garden of Sam’s cherished grandmother’s Midtown apartment in October 2018. Sam’s dad, a professional photographer, was waiting in the wings to capture the moment. When we walked back into the apartment, Sam had invited an intimate circle of family and friends to surprise me.” They celebrated with a custom menu at one of Matty’s favorite restaurants.  When it came to wedding planning, they started with what they didn’t want. “In our first meeting, I told planner Allison Jackson how important it was for our guests to feel comfortable,” Matty recalls. “I wrote out a list of everything I ever hated about going to weddings, and asked her if we could eliminate or improve on as many of those things as possible. I wanted the vibe to be Friday night at your favorite bar in New Orleans—but in the mountains. I love the aesthetic of Jack Rose, a restaurant in the Pontchartrain Hotel in New Orleans, so that’s where we had our meeting.”  The venue, at least, was a no-brainer. “The Matalin-Carville family farm—built in 1753, and bought by Matty’s parents six months before Matty was born—is where Matty and her sister spent their early years,” the couple shares. “It’s where they always gathered for the most important and special events in their lives.” The bride's wedding would be no different. From there, the couple pegged vendors who matched their creativity and enthusiasm for doing something unexpected. “We wanted to think really out-of-the-box and have a lot of fun,” they say. Of course, nods to their psychic-predicted meeting and soulmate status were woven into the celebration.  Read on to see all the playfully unique details of Matty and Sam’s November 6, 2021, wedding day, planned by Allison Jackson of Pineapple Productions and photographed by Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The palette was pulled from “colors of nature, autumnal jewel tones, and a variety of textures,” Matty says. “We love bird watching together in Audubon Park in New Orleans, so we incorporated a bird motif throughout.”  While this lead to a beautiful invitation design, getting them to guests was a challenge. They changed their date due to the pandemic, then the new invites were shipped during hurricane season in Louisiana, where many of their 250 guests reside. “Our invitation send-out unfortunately coincided with Hurricane Ida, so everyone’s mail was disrupted and many were evacuated for long periods of time. Some folks’ hard copy of the invitation arrived a month after our wedding,” Matty says. “To all future brides, I would recommend the practice of perspective and laughing at the things you just can’t control.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much, and that their presence at our wedding means so much.  Photo by Kate Headley  The personalized touches was endless, and the couple took on quite a few DIYs. “The best example would be our guest goody bags,” they say. ""We had fun cups made with our name and date; gave out copies of Matty’s grandmother’s cookbook; and even had T-shirts made that said, ‘Someone in the Shenandoah Valley Loves Me.’ Was it cheesy? Sure. Did we care? Hell no! We wanted our guests to know that we love them so much. We know things have been difficult for everyone and their presence at our wedding means that much more because of it.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  For her bridal attire, Matty paired a crepe Sarah Seven gown with an overskirt by Alexandra Grecco. “I had long been a fan of Sarah Seven; all her gowns are so chic,” the bride says. ""It was the first one I tried on, and my heart knew immediately. I paired it with the overskirt at the suggestion of my sister—the most stylish person I know—and I fell in love with the combo. The other key was trying it on with the cathedral-length veil. I also wore a bow from my mother’s wedding gown, which she hand-sewed onto the back of my skirt.”  Matty's makeup look was effortlessly beautiful, with hair was inspired by her mother. “My mom wore a Vera Wang headband on her wedding day, and I wanted to mirror that with a white headband that I had [our florist] decorate with fresh flowers,” Matty says. “It felt really glam and fun, and my hair was out of my face so I could dance all night.”  Photo by Kate Headley  “The best, best accessory was the homemade flower crowns my cousin made for all the kids,” Matty shares. “Her daughter was one of our flower girls, and she was sure to model it like a pro and show the other kids how to wear it with enthusiasm. We also had cute little signs for our kiddos to wear down the aisle—things like, ‘I’m just here for the cake!’ and ‘Has anyone seen the rings?’ It added levity and humor in a serious moment.”  Photo by Kate Headley  As guests entered the ceremony space, they were greeted with warm spiked local apple cider and savory parmesan rosemary shortbread. “The focal point of our ceremony decor was the floating chuppah, which was designed by Amaryllis Floral & Event Design. The die-cut wood chuppah frame was suspended from the poles of our sailcloth tent,” Matty describes. ""The corners of the chuppah were adorned with silk ribbons. During our ceremony, special friends and family members pinned photos of lost loved ones to the ribbons.” To make the event more intimate and inclusive, they set their ceremony in the round.  Photo by Kate Headley  Matty’s dad, James Carville—a well-known political strategist, commentator, and author—walked her down the aisle to the sounds of “Stand by Me” strummed by a string quartet. Her mother, meanwhile, looked very chic in pink. “She wore a Carolina Herrera dress and accessorized it with an Oscar de la Renta boa and vintage Givenchy opera coat,” Matty says. “She also carried a small posy of roses and dahlias, accented with peacock feathers, a symbol of good luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  There was no first look, as the bride and groom wanted to see each ofter for the first time at the ends of the aisle. “It was amazing,” Matty shares. “I got the teary-eyed photo of Sam under the chuppah that I always wanted!” During the ceremony, “I loved sharing our Jewish faith traditions with Matty’s Catholic family, and I loved that they loved it,” Sam says. “I’m also so glad we wrote our own vows. We really said everything we needed to say [and] made promises we’re excited to keep. To me, that’s the best way to start life together.”  Guests tossed birdseed and confetti at the newlyweds as they retreated down the aisle. “Our recessional was a traditional hymn, but it morphed into ‘Jambalaya (On the Bayou)’ by Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Ray Charles, which my dad arranged as a surprise on our wedding day,” Matty says. “Guests were dancing down the aisle as they made their way out of the tent to the cocktail hour.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  The newlyweds traversed the property to enjoy the first few moments as husband and wife, and took portraits with their photographer Kate Headley.  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “An oversized wooden wagon held candles and soaps my mother made in the months leading up to our wedding day for each guest,” Matty says. Guests filled swag bags and snapped photos in a vintage trailer during cocktail hour, while a Cajun zydeco band created a festive atmosphere. “We had a variety of signature cocktails inspired by our family and friends,” Matty says. “We clipped fortunes to cocktails and served them with tarot card coasters as a fun nod to our psychic-predicted meeting.”  Photo by Kate Headley  We melded NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of the Shenandoah Valley.  Photo by Kate Headley  The reception tent decor was inspired by Jack Rose, the New Orleans restaurant where they’d had that first meeting with their planner. “Allison suggested we approach the design by melding NOLA’s spirit of fun and exuberance with the bucolic elegance of Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley,” Matty says. “Our tent was draped in rich textured peacock-blue fabric and finished at the top with a patterned valance. Wrought-iron and gold-leaf lanterns with pillar candles, Southern smilax, and dripping jewel-toned flowers filled the ceiling of the tent for a whimsical and lush look.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Photo by Kate Headley  “A large oval mahogany bar featured decorative panels with a bold coordinating print,” Matty continues. “The center of the bar housed a large shelving unit filled with botanicals and curiosities—even a peacock, which is a known omen foretelling success and luck.”  Photo by Kate Headley  The bandstand was created from a wooden wall painted brick red and decorated with disco balls and a neon sign reading “You Belong Here.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Their semi-naked cake was adorned with sugar flowers, fresh figs, and Seckel pears—and there were more treats, as well. “Our groom’s cake was a delicious loaf of challah surrounded by honeycomb and fresh figs. Southern sweets like Mississippi mud bars and lemon squares rounded out the dessert menu.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Dinner was an homage to New Orleans. “Roasted outside our tent in an antique trailer, traditional cajun-style whole suckling pig was served at a butcher-block table with local apple chutney,” Matty says. There was also jambalaya, New Orleans roast beef debris, and blackened redfish. The couple even served a famous salad recipe pulled from the Carville family cookbook.  Photo by Kate Headley  The duo had their first dance to Neil Young’s “Harvest Moon,” then the party got going. “Reaching out for Sam’s hand and looking over the crowd together when we were lifted up for the hora, I thanked my lucky stars for the health and presence of everyone there,” Matty shares of her most cherished moment from the day. “I tried to just melt into the blessings around me.”  Photo by Kate Headley  Fireworks erupted as a surprise grand finale to the evening, while chicken sliders and paper cones of tater tots were passed around. Looking back on the day, Matty has some advice for other to-be-weds. “Be bold, lead with kindness, politely ask for what you want, and cultivate your own style and infuse that into your wedding in a way that genuinely celebrates the love you have for your partner, your family, and your guests,” she says. “Also, trust the professionals—you’ll be blown away by their creativity.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRlcy5jb20vdmlyZ2luaWEtZmFybS13ZWRkaW5nLXRhcm90LWJvbGQtcGFsZXR0ZS03NDk3NTY40gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

"wedding","2023-05-16","Not Discerned","{""Dolores"", ""Peten"", ""Guatemala""}","Wed 17 May 2023 01:11:43","The real reason Melissa and Joe Gorga skipped Teresa Giudice and Louie Ruelas' wedding has finally been revealed, and it's more sinister than you think!  All was made clear on the season 13 finale of The Real Housewives of New Jersey Tuesday, which saw Melissa share the ""big secret"" she said she's been keeping to herself the last six months.  Opening up the morning after the finale party, Melissa said that it all started with the rumor that Melissa was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband in the backseat of a car.  ""For the last six months, I've been trying to keep this big secret, because I was doing everything in my power to keep the family together,"" Melissa says.  ""I didn't want to say anything, because I was scared that they were going to ruin my wedding,"" Teresa goes on to claim.  The episode then flashes back to the night of Dolores Catania's Irish-themed, 1920s ""prohibition"" party, where everything came to a head.  Danielle Cabral breaks the news to Melissa that Margaret Josephs' former friend, Laura Jensen, told Jennifer Aydin and Teresa that Margaret has dirt on Melissa, claiming she was caught hooking up with a man who is not her husband. It's then that Melissa stops Danielle and tells her she's already heard this story... from her own husband.  ""You wanna know how I heard it through my husband? 'Cause his sister called him over to her house secretly without me to tell him this story behind my back. Pretty f**ked up sister-in-law I have, isn't it?"" Melissa fires back.  The longtime RHONJ star proceeded to break things down in a confessional, calling the rumor ""baseless.""  ""Six months ago, Teresa called Joe over with Louie, because she heard a rumor about me, and she believes it so much, that she had to call her brother over. How dare you tell my husband that I would cheat on him?"" Melissa asks. ""You're saying this off a baseless rumor, from some woman who wants to hurt Margaret with no facts. No anything. Did she think he was just going to pack his bags and leave? Like, what the f**k are you doing?""  Fired up and frustrated at this point, Melissa tells Danielle that she should've called both Melissa and Teresa over to have this conversation. Danielle is confused by Melissa's claim that Teresa would want the cheating rumor to be true -- it becomes clear then that maybe Danielle isn't too well-versed in the years-long back-and-forth between Melissa and her sister-in-law.  ""Are you kidding me? Doll face, look at me. I have been accused of being a stripper. I have been accused of doing stuff in parking lots before,"" Melissa says. ""She's said multiple times, 'Your wife will leave you for a richer man.' She's said multiple things that we have let go in our life.""  Melissa shares that she had no intention of confronting Teresa about the meeting or the rumor because Joe himself doesn't believe it.  ""It's bulls**t and because I wanted to let her have a peaceful six months leading up to her wedding,"" Melissa says in a confessional. ""And look what ends up happening: she has her minion make me look bad in front of everyone, so everyone can hear the words 'Melissa's a cheater,' and I am done.""  Demanding to know why Teresa called Joe to the house to tell him about the alleged cheating, Melissa asks her sister-in-law for an explanation.  ""First of all, it wasn't his sister. It was Louie. He was like, 'I wanna tell your brother that all this is coming from Margaret, so your brother can get in front of it,'"" Teresa claims in a confessional. ""So, he was looking out for my brother. And I never repeated it to anymore.""  At this point, the entire party is heated, with fights breaking out amongst nearly everyone on the cast. The group begins to separate into their couples as they unpack what just happened. After getting the play-by-play from Melissa, Joe sets things straight in a confessional.  ""I get a call from Louie, 'What are ya doin'? I need to see you right away. It's very important.' So, I go to her house and Louie says, 'We heard that Melissa cheated on you.' I go, 'Guys, you got the wrong girl,'"" Joe tells the cameras.  Melissa starts to believe the altercation was all a set-up and tells the cameras that she thinks Teresa knew Danielle was going to tell her at the party.  After more back-and-forth and a heated argument between Joe and Louie, the group disbands, with everyone starting to make their way home for the night.  It's now the morning after the party and Melissa calls Dolores to go over the night's events, it's then she shares that she and Joe won't be going to Teresa and Louie's wedding.  ""Dolores, how can I go and celebrate someone else's marriage when they are the people that are constantly trying to destroy mine?"" Melissa says. ""I'm not doing it.""  Dolores tells Melissa if they don't go to the wedding, then she and Joe's relationship with Teresa is ""over-over,"" to which Melissa replies, ""It's been over.""  Already on the way to Teresa's house, Dolores tells Melissa that she plans to tell Teresa about her decision to skip the wedding. And she does just that, breaking the news to the couple, who are just days away from getting married.  ""They hate us,"" Teresa says after finding out about Melissa's decision. ""Obviously, they're not happy for us... This has been going on over 10 years. I dealt with it with my ex, I'm not going to deal with it in my new chapter of my life. I'm so done.""  Later in a confessional, Teresa says that she doesn't want a family ""like that,"" if this is the way things are going to be.  ""I know she's been wanting to get my brother away from me all this time,"" Teresa says of Melissa. ""She got her wish. She got her wish.""  The season ends with Melissa and Teresa in a worse place than viewers have seen them to date, signaling that things between this family may really be ""over-over.""  The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Bravo.

"wedding","1761-10-14","Not Discerned","{""Bridgeton"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 19:09:28","Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story opens with a disclaimer. “This is the story of Queen Charlotte from Bridgerton,” the soothing voice of Julie Andrews reads as the text appears onscreen. That is to say: It is not the story of the real Queen Charlotte. “It is not a history lesson,” the statement continues. “It is fiction inspired by fact. All liberties taken by the author are quite intentional.” And while that is certainly the case—no one can truly know what went on in Charlotte and King George III’s relationship—some parts of the show actually are true to life. This is particularly the case when it comes to Queen Charlotte’s wedding.  Queen Charlotte shows a 17-year-old Princess Charlotte being quickly married off to a 22-year-old King George, leaving her home in Germany and getting married the same day she arrived. That all actually happened. Here are some more details about the real royal wedding as they compare to the hit Netflix show.  Charlotte’s journey to England was pretty accurately depicted.  On the show, British royal representatives arrive in Mirow, the dukedom in northern Germany where Charlotte lived as Princess Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Her brother, Adolphus, signs the contract for Charlotte to marry King George III. Adolphus then makes the journey to England with Charlotte.  This is all true to life, but some details were missing. The official British royal family website explains that the escorts who arrived in Germany to collect Charlotte were led by the Earl of Harcourt. According to the site, the group didn’t leave right away. Instead, they were three days of celebrations, and then they returned to England with Charlotte where she would begin her new life.    While Queen Charlotte shows the future queen complaining of her uncomfortable outfit and whale bone corset, the journey was actually hard for a different reason. The royal family site notes that the voyage was difficult and the group faced three storms while crossing the North Sea. It also was a very long trip: They left Germany on August 17 and didn’t get to London until September 8.  While Charlotte and Adolphus are traveling, he mentions that their parents have died. This was also true, and the death of their mother was very recent—she had died only three months earlier.  Charlotte got married the same day she arrived.  Queen Charlotte shows Charlotte and George getting married the same day that she arrives in England. And as surprising as it may seem, this is what actually happened.  “At 9:00 p.m. the same evening, within six hours of arrival, the wedding of Princess Charlotte and King George III took place at the Chapel Royal, St James’s Palace,” the royal family site reads.  The show features a confrontation on the wedding day between Charlotte and George’s mother, Princess Augusta, in which they argue about Charlotte’s wedding dress—she wants to wear the one she had made in Paris; Augusta wants her to wear an English-style dress. According to the Washington Post, the real George had requested that gowns be made for Charlotte and be ready when she arrived.  According to Percy Fitzgerald’s book, The Good Queen Charlotte (per Town & Country), for her wedding Charlotte “wore ‘an endless mantle’ of rich violet and purple velvet, lined with ermine, over a white satin and silver dress.” In the show, she does wear a silver and white gown—just without the purple velvet addition.  As for what wasn’t based on history...  A key part of the show is the fact that Charlotte is Black and the royal court becomes integrated thanks to her becoming queen. In reality, while there has been speculation that Charlotte had African ancestry, most historians agree that this idea lacks evidence and isn’t accurate. Instead, the show takes this idea and runs with it, which makes for an interesting story, but it means that the real wedding didn’t actually feature all the non-white members of the ton being invited to the royal wedding at the last minute.  As for other exaggerated or made-up moments, those are probably pretty obvious. Did Charlotte actually try to escape her fate as the Queen of Great Britain and Ireland by climbing over a fence? Probably not, but it did make for a charming royal meet-cute with Farmer George.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc21vcG9saXRhbi5jb20vZW50ZXJ0YWlubWVudC90di9hNDM5MDcwMjEvcXVlZW4tY2hhcmxvdHRlLXdlZGRpbmctdHJ1ZS1zdG9yeS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The 28-year-old heir to the throne is set to wed fiancée Rajwa Al-Saif on June 1, and one guest has already given a hint about the dress code. According to Royal Watcher blogger Saad Salman, Queen Azizah of Malaysia confirmed that she and her husband, King Abdullah, are attending the wedding, where the attire will be ""more like black tie, long dress but no tiaras..."" Salman tweeted on Monday.  It remains to be seen if the bride will sport a tiara on her big day.  Hello! magazine reports that other royal guests in attendance will include Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel of Sweden, Princess Hisakoa of Japan and her daughter Princess Tsuguko and Crown Prince Haakon of Norway.  The excitement continues to build before the big day, and the Royal Hashemite Court even released an official logo for the next Jordanian royal wedding.  ""As the date of the wedding of HRH Crown Prince Al Hussein and Miss Rajwa Khalid Alseif nears, we are pleased to share the official logo to mark the occasion, which is Arabic for 'we rejoice,' "" courtiers tweeted Sunday, sharing a quick clip of the crown-topped graphic on a burgundy background. Like many modern nuptials, there's even a hashtag — #CelebratingAlHussein.  Prince Hussein and Rajwa, 29, announced their engagement in August 2022 by sharing a formal portrait on Instagram.  ""We pray that God grants us His blessings. Grateful to my dear Jordanian family for their heartfelt support and kind wishes,"" Hussein wrote of the photo where he and Rajwa posed close, her diamond ring on display.

"wedding","2023-05-18","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 20:27:18","A groom revealed at the altar that his bride’s engagement ring contains more than just a dazzling diamond but also pieces of her very own DNA — and now, his dental confession is going viral.  Doctor and TikToker Justin Tyler Fox gained over 9.1 million views, 2.3 million likes and 20,000 comments when he uploaded the wedding day confession to his account.  However, while many wedding day videos go viral for rather upsetting reasons — like the bride who served her guests $48 bottles of antibloat pills at the reception, or the groom whose “disgusting” wedding vows set off red flags all across TikTok — Justin’s wedding day footage is making a positive impact on TikTok by touching people’s hearts (and raising the bar for vows from here on out).  Fox begins his viral vows by asking his bride, Raven, “Do you remember the day I knew for a fact I was going to marry you?” He then recalls the story for all their family and friends — and now, for all the TikTok viewers at home.  According to Justin, he decided to marry Raven after a very special hiking trip — and after her fateful fall attempting to follow him across a river.  When she took the nasty fall, he knew this was someone who would follow him to any place on earth, someone who would be by his side on every adventure and challenge.  Thus, to capture this very special moment, Justin secretly took a part of that day — and a part of Raven — and had it tucked away inside her ring.  Later, after proposing to Raven and putting the ring on her finger, she asked him, “What is this spot right there? Is there supposed to be a diamond in there?”  Justin recalled explaining to her, “I told you, ‘No, that’s the way it’s supposed to be,’ and one day, I would tell you what the significance of that little rock was. Well, today is that day. Here’s my confession. That little stone in your ring is made out of dentine and enamel. When I picked it up that day, I went straight to the jeweler and I said, ‘Can you put this in my engagement ring?’”  Justin and Raven’s wedding guests were immediately moved by the story — as were millions of TikTokers, who begged for a video of his full wedding vows (a wish Justin later granted).  Over 20,000 TikTokers were deeply moved by Justin and Raven’s story, and their love.  “If his vows ain’t like this I don’t want him 🥹🤣,” laughed @ncsquared.  “This ladies and gentleman are wedding vows! This is love, a true testament of love, faith, God and laughter.♥️i wish y’all an eternity!” commented @ingridsshenanigans.  “these are the things that should be viral. pure genuine sentimental love. this is beautiful 💕,” wrote @lissmorales__.  While not every bride might appreciate having a tooth hidden inside their engagement ring, Justin’s unique custom ring captures their special love story — and will, hopefully, inspire partners everywhere to step up their vow and proposal game!

It’s wedding season, y’all. That means you’re going to have to pony up and buy that flight to that oddly remote destination your friend picked for their wedding two and a half hours from the nearest airport. Great venue choice, Bud!  For many people, wedding season can come as an embarrassing experience of wearing the same navy suit and tie you’ve had since high school graduation. Well, let me tell you, bro: It’s time to step up your game. Whether you’re going solo in hopes of meeting a bridesmaid or attending as a plus one to the event, you need to look your best. Fortunately, we’ve done the research to help you figure out what to wear as a plus-one to a wedding if you don’t want to look like every other person there.  Advice on Matching Your Date: If you’re going with a date, you should complement them, but avoid matching their look exactly—this isn’t your high school prom. If your date is wearing a certain color, choose accessories in similar or complementary shades or tones. For example, if your date is wearing a navy blue dress, opt for a different shade of blue, like sky or teal. If they are wearing pink or red, wear blue or green so that you complement each other but still look great when separated. And if they are wearing white, well then you wear whatever they told you to wear.  Try using a color wheel to match clothes and follow these few steps:  Choose one dominant color for your event outfit. Now, this could be a color that compliments your skin tone or just a color that you like to wear. Find the complementary color on a color wheel. This is the color opposite your dominant color on the wheel. Look for comparable colors on the color wheel. These could be the colors next to your dominant color or down the line in terms of shade. These analogous colors will help create a cohesive and harmonious look for your getup. Lastly, consider using neutral colors such as black, white, gray, or beige to balance out your outfit and leave room for small bits of flare.

The development speaks to an 872% increase in searches for handmade gifts on Etsy, indicative of a significant shift away from mass-produced items. The new platform, a game-changer for small businesses, is now live and accessible at Etsy.com/Registry.  What sets Etsy Registry apart is its support for independent creators and small businesses. It facilitates the selection of handmade, vintage, and personalized items, allowing couples to outline the precise customization they want. This makes Etsy a one-stop-shop for not only gifts, but also wedding decor and bridal party items.  Antoni Porowski, TV personality, and his fiancé Kevin Harrington have endorsed the platform, curating their own gift registry filled with unique items from worldwide makers. “One of the best parts about registering with Etsy is that you can choose custom, personalized gifts that never feel cookie cutter,” shares Antoni, hinting at the fun they had in curating their unique list of wedding items.  Alongside the launch of Etsy Registry, Etsy has also released its annual 2023 wedding trend guide. This year, couples are placing importance on fun and creativity, with unique twists on tradition taking center stage. Themes, elaborate programs, and unconventional bridal looks and rings are all part of the mix, adding to the excitement of saying “I do”.  Among the 2023 wedding trends identified by Etsy are Lovecore, Oversized florals, Western weddings, Love story gifts, and Rings with character. Lovecore sees an influx of heart patterns, roses, and red and pink hues, while Oversized florals incorporate rosettes and floral appliqués to add texture and romance. Western weddings bring a laid-back, unconventional style, and Love story gifts promote personalized mementos that celebrate each couple’s unique journey. Rings with character is a trend that showcases individuality, with handmade, unique rings gaining popularity over traditional designs.  For small businesses in the wedding industry, these trends provide a roadmap for product development and marketing. It opens avenues for those skilled in crafting handmade and personalized items, floral designs, or western-themed goods to tap into a growing market. Similarly, businesses specializing in love story gifts can hone their product range and marketing strategies based on the current trends, attracting more customers seeking unique, meaningful presents.  It’s important to note that this shift toward personalized and meaningful wedding items isn’t just a trend, but a sign of a larger movement towards conscious consumption. As consumers become more aware of their purchases’ impacts, they’re turning towards small businesses and independent creators who offer unique, handmade, and personalized items. The success of Etsy Registry could pave the way for a more diverse, personalized, and meaningful wedding gift industry, providing a significant boost to small businesses worldwide.  It’s clear that Etsy Registry is more than just a platform; it’s a statement on the future of the wedding industry. With its focus on personalization, creativity, and support for small businesses, Etsy is reshaping the way we think about wedding gifts and decor. And for small businesses, it’s an opportunity to connect with customers on a deeper level, offering products that are not only beautiful but meaningful as well.

"wedding","2023-09-15","Not Discerned","{""Fargo"", ""NorthDakota"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 11:14:00","FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - Casey Ford and his fiance Allison Torkelson are set to get married in September, but never could they imagine they would be forced to find a new venue and caterer, just months before the wedding.  Ford says, last February, he and his soon-to-be wife coordinated with Bigfoot Bar and Grill, which was operated out of the Ramada Inn in Grand Forks, to plan their wedding. He says they wrote out a $1,400 deposit check to Bigfoot to secure catering and the use of the Ramada Inn banquet hall.  “They cashed it two to three weeks after that. Everything was fine. The communication was fine,” said Ford.  Although, everything did not turn out fine. Ford says he learned from social media that the business had closed.  “I found out on Facebook that they are splitting ways with Ramada. There was no communication there. I emailed them again saying, I found out through Facebook that you are splitting up. What’s the deal,” he said.  Ford says he learned of the closing through a posting on a Facebook group. The posting was from another soon-to-bride, who was having the same issue. Several screenshots were attached showing the woman’s many attempts to also contact Bigfoot to determine the fate of her wedding. The post accumulated more than 60 comments from others going through the same problem or those who have had less-than-desirable interactions with the business.  He also says there have been several attempts to contact Bigfoot’s owner since learning of the closure, but there has been little to no response.  “I’ve tried calling. I’ve tried emailing. My dad has been doing things on his end in Grand Forks to try and get in contact and we’ve just heard nothing.”  Not only was the couple out $1,400, they also had to find a new venue. All he wants now is to have the money refunded.  “It doesn’t feel good. $1,400 is a lot of money. That could go towards our wedding at the new place,” Ford said. “Having to find out through a third-party source that they are splitting and we don’t have a wedding. Don’t have a location and we had to go to other venues. That 1,400 would mean a lot.”  Google listed Bigfoot as permanently closed. Also, when visiting the business website, the word “closed” is plastered across the homepage.  According to an article from the Winnipeg Free Press, Bigfoot’s owner Ty Cox was facing deportation from Canada in 2014 after he allegedly scammed a charity for kids out of $7,200. It’s unclear if he was ever actually deported.  A representative from Ramada Inn confirmed Bigfoot was no longer operating in their hotel. The representative says they were not made aware of the full list of weddings scheduled. Although, they state the hotel will honor the commitment to host some weddings in certain situations.  If there are couples who have coordinated their weddings with Bigfoot and still wish to host their event at the Ramada, you can contact Assistant Manager Tiffany at (701) 203-1714.  Our requests for comment from the owner of Bigfoot Bar and Grill have gone unanswered.  Copyright 2023 KVLY.

"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Norway"", ""Wisconsin"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 14:09:36","Q:  My fiancée and I are putting together the guest list for our wedding and we’ve run into a social quandary. It will be a small wedding, and we want to invite two of our mutual friends who are married to each other. We mostly knew them as a monogamous couple, but since we moved to another state, they have become part of a polycule. We love our friends, and want everyone at this intimate gathering to feel comfortable. We’ve never met the two newest people in their relationship, but they all seem to be getting more serious about each other. Should we invite just the two friends, or the whole polycule? How do we know when a +1 should actually be a +2 or +3?  A:  Hello! Fellow queer person currently planning a wedding here and experiencing intermittent guest list stress, so I am answering from that perspective! The simplified version of my answer is this: Basically, you can treat these friends the same way as you treat other friends who have maybe started new relationships where you don’t know their partners. Are you automatically inviting all of your monogamously partnered friends’ partners even if you’ve never met them before or don’t really have your own friendships with them? Then it might be the most “fair” to consider inviting these friends’ partners. If you have left off some friend’s partners who you don’t know, then it’s fine to leave these ones off, too, regardless of how serious the relationship is.  My slightly more complicated (or perhaps liberating for you — idk!) answer is that you can invite or not invite whoever you want to your wedding. A lot of “guest list” etiquette is outdated when it comes to +1s — and I don’t mean in the sense that obviously old and heteronormative rules don’t take into account polycules or poly relationship structures but just in the sense that +1s in general don’t always need to be the default. Not everyone on the guest list for my wedding gets a +1 — even for some folks who are monogamously partnered! My fiancé and I basically went with our own personal “rules” for +1s, which weren’t codified rules at all but just rather who we thought it made the most sense to invite. We have some friends who are newer to our lives, and it just didn’t make a ton of sense for us to invite their partners who we’ve never met. We have some friends who we spend a ton of time with who never really bring their partners around, so in some of those cases, we also didn’t feel bad about not extending +1s. I have cousins in Norway who are invited who are married or otherwise in longterm partnerships whose partners are not invited, which I knew would be especially chill because Norwegians think Americans are kinda extra with all the +1 stuff at weddings.  The size of your guest list is the #1 determining factor for the cost of your wedding — full stop. I don’t think anyone understands this until they’ve planned a wedding themselves (myself included!), but the smallest adjustments to size can make a huge difference. It’s not “just a few extra people” in a lot of cases; it automatically makes the price of food, drink, programs, etc go up. And if you’re planning a small wedding, then it makes it all the more true that small fluctuations would have a big impact. The thing that really stands out to me is that you’ve never met these other people in the polycule. Except in a few very rare cases, my fiancé and I aren’t inviting anyone who hasn’t been met by at least one of us.  Every time I experienced stress while working on our guest list, I had a helpful friend who reminded me that there’s no way to make everyone happy; you should focus on making yourselves happy. No one should be invited to a wedding solely because you feel socially obligated to do so. You have to come up with whatever “rules” make the most sense for you — and they can be amorphous like ours ultimately were.  Of course, no one should feel excluded just because they choose a polyamorous approach to their relationships. Ask yourself this though: If these two people who you’re both friends with had recently broken up and were now seriously dating new people, would you invite those new partners? If any of your monogamous friends broke up and started seeing new people, would you invite those new people, too? If the answer is yes without a doubt, then sure, go ahead and invite their full polycule. If the answer is no or you’re unsure, then maybe remind yourselves that what really matters is the people you’re closest to are at your special day, and sometimes that doesn’t include everyone those people are also close to.  Also, something that’s helpful to keep in mind is that there’s absolutely nothing wrong with guest +1s being on, for lack of a better phrase, a “backup list.” If you have enough people decline when they RSVP to your wedding, then perhaps you can add in extra +1s — either for these friends or for other friends who are in new relationships or even for single friends who you think might benefit from a date. In general, my guest list has what I call a “no randos” policy, which basically means no blanket +1s for folks — except in a few individual cases where I know the person invited ONLY knows me and my fiancé and I wanted them to have a buddy. See, this is what I mean by amorphous rules! Be flexible and not overly constrained by etiquette, which can be super rigid!  I totally understand the impulse of wanting to make sure your approach to social expectations are inclusive and fair, but I also think it’s okay to play by your own rules when it comes to a wedding and go with your instincts. So long as the decision is being made from a place of what you actually want and not what you think others expect of you, I think whatever choice you make is ultimately yours and doesn’t have to be defended to anyone. The fact that you’re asking this question in the first place signals to me that you take your friends’ relationships seriously.  You can chime in with your advice in the comments and submit your own questions any time.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9zdHJhZGRsZS5jb20vc2hvdWxkLWktaW52aXRlLW15LWZyaWVuZHMtd2hvbGUtcG9seWN1bGUtdG8tbXktd2VkZGluZy_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

The key to finding just the right look? Skip stilettos in favor of flat sandals and go for the best beach wedding guest dresses that are wearable and refined at once.  “Look for styles that are flowy, made with lightweight fabrics like linen and viscose to help to keep you cool, and that you can dance on the beach in all night,” Suzanne Smallshaw, senior director of fashion and styling at , tells Bazaar. “If you’re looking for a more form-fitting dress, opt for one with breathable stretch, so you’re comfortable from the afternoon ceremony to sunset cocktails.”  Don’t be afraid to lean into bold, bright designs. In fact, Smallshaw suggests looking to mood-boosting spring 2023 trends for inspiration. “Opt for vibrant colors, seasonal prints, and interesting details or cutouts to show off a little skin,” she says. “Playful pleats, sunset-inspired hues, and mermaid-esque silhouettes are top themes this summer that would also play wonderfully in a beach wedding setting.”  Attending a black-tie seaside ceremony? Try a floor-length slipdress in a bright graphic print. If the invite specifies semiformal or cocktail attire, go for a dreamy puff-sleeve maxi or an ornate lace mini with a slightly relaxed fit. To enhance the vibe of your beach-chic look, Smallshaw suggests adding timeless, beachy touches like straw bags, gold jewelry, and pearls.  Whether you’re staying local or traveling to faraway shores, I did the research and tapped Smallshaw’s expertise to find the 25 best beach wedding guest dresses for every kind of seaside ceremony.

Each day this week, we’ll be asking our resident “Wediquette” expert and “Let Them Eat Cake” editor Melanie Spencer a frequently asked question or one from a reader.  Yesterday, we started the week off with a topic that can be tricky to navigate for many – money. Click here to see if there is a minimum amount to spend on a wedding present.  Today, we’re covering a big fashion pet peeve of ours surrounding wedding guests.  Question: How much is too much white in a wedding outfit? Can I wear white shoes/white purse/accessories?  Answer: It’s OK if an outfit has some white in it. What we want to avoid is attire that’s more white than any other color. So, for example, a blue dress with white flowers is fine. But it would be best to avoid a white dress with blue flowers. This guideline is mainly about steering clear of upstaging the couple getting married, since traditionally at least one person often wears a white dress, pantsuit or what have you. When it comes to accessories, I would err on the side of no white (for shoes and purse especially), because if one or more person in the betrothed couple is wearing white, they will likely also use white accessories and, again, it’s best to avoid anything that could smack of upstaging. All of this being said, if the couple instructs guests to wear white (or any specific color), definitely do as they request, because they are clearly going for a look and a vibe and you don’t want to be ‘that guy’.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bmV3b3JsZWFucy5jb20vd2VkaXF1ZXR0ZS13ZWVrLWhvdy1tdWNoLWlzLXRvby1tdWNoLXdoaXRlLWluLWEtd2VkZGluZy1vdXRmaXQv0gEA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Focus on what you want to use and see every day.  Much conversation surrounds the wedding itself — the prep and planning for the Big Day and the related festivities are the topics du jour as couples consider the various elements of their union. But the wedding is the start of something new, and there should be some careful consideration of your life at home — whether it’s what items to register for or how to “marry” interior design aesthetics.  Whether you move in together before or after “I do,” you’re bound to have too much of one thing, too little of another — and some items that have to go. “Taking both aesthetics and blending them together is important,” says Maureen Block, of Mason Grey Interiors in Newtown Square. “This is a new space that should reflect both personalities. Everyone should feel comfortable at home.” Here are Block’s tricks for settling in.  If you’re looking for more planning advice, check out our guides to nontraditional bouquets, stocking an N/A wedding bar, managing wedding stress, budgeting, size-inclusive wedding attire, and more.  1. Take inventory of everything. Knowing what you both have helps you see what you may need.  2. Know what the long-term shared goal for each area is. Making and agreeing on a plan to proceed room by room or space by space is key.  3. Set a budget, and don’t be afraid of using a designer. It’s an investment, but it can help save time and money in the long run. But remember, communication in any relationship is key — especially  with your designer.  4. Consider your non-negotiables. Maybe it’s an oversize recliner that one of you must have but the other hates. Rather than arguing, design around it with great pillows or art pieces to draw the eye away.  5. When it comes to your registry, only bring into your home what you really love. Focus on the pieces you want to use and see every day.  What’s the Best Registry For …  COZY-CHIC HOUSEWARES?  Head to Anthropologie in Rittenhouse. The store’s eclectic lineup of bedding and functional but fun cookware often gets overlooked for its clothing selection, but who doesn’t need a cake stand shaped like a lily pad?  CONSCIOUS ART?  Try South Kensington nonprofit InLiquid. The organization’s new registry­ lets couples curate a selection of pieces from Philly artists at a variety of price points and styles. (Email Sara Zimmerman at saraz@inliquid.org to register.)  GIFTS FROM A GROUP?  Best for a couple that already has a home full of practical items — Ilyan Jewelry in Haverford has plenty of sparkle. Perhaps your wedding party wants to go in on a chic charm to commemorate the day.

However, one woman said she pulled off her perfect day at a great price by hiring an unlikely caterer: Chili’s.  In a viral video, user @brideisapersonality explained how having Chili’s as her caterer saved her a ton of money.  “We served Chili’s at our wedding and this is how much we spent,” the TikToker began the video.  In the background, she holds a receipt that features what the total was and everything she served to guests, including chips and salsa, salad, egg rolls, cajun chicken pasta, chicken tenders, sliders.  “Our total cost for our wedding food was $1,950 for 99 guests,” she said. “This also includes five specialty meals that we did for people who were gluten-free, dairy-free, and can’t eat meat, and people who needed special items like no dairy, only seafood, etc.”  While the TikToker was thoroughly impressed with the price point for all of the food, she said she did run into unexpected hurdles. “We had to pick it up pretty early because we didn’t want to pay the delivery fees,” she continued.  The TikToker said her wedding day also fell on St. Patrick’s Day, and the restaurant prepared the food ahead of time to ensure the entire order could be fulfilled. This meant the food had to be rewarmed and set up by the bride, her family, and the servers she hired to wait on guests and help clean up.  “We had to have our hired servers who were really supposed to be like cleaning, serving, preparing, really do a lot of the cooking. My coordinator had to show them what to do and take on a role that she wasn’t really supposed to do,” the TikToker said. “That was just a lot more work than we had anticipated.”  Nonetheless, the TikToker said she was still happy with her choice.  “The food was amazing,” she concluded. “It was the perfect meal for our wedding.”  Her video was viewed over 1.3 million times. Some viewers criticized the bride for not simply having the food delivered and expecting her servers to do additional, unexpected labor. “I’m all for this, but as someone who works in the industry, this sounds like a nightmare for your staff and coordinator,” user @mars wrote. “You should have paid delivery.”  However, others applauded the bride’s decision to go with a cost-effective option that still makes guests happy.  “Normalize this,” a commenter wrote. “Weddings are so out of control! Such a great idea!”  “I would be so hype to find out the wedding food was Chili’s,” one user commented.  Chili’s also eventually chimed in with a simple comment on the bride’s video: “Iconic.”  The Daily Dot reached out to @brideisapersonality and Chili’s for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxpcy1jYXRlci13ZWRkaW5nL9IBN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9uZXdzL2NoaWxpcy1jYXRlci13ZWRkaW5nLz9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Example video title will go here for this video  GLASTONBURY, Conn. — Spring is here and that means it’s officially wedding season.  The wedding industry is seeing a huge boost in business after the COVID-19 pandemic wrecked wedding plans for brides across the state.  Now venues are just catching up with their rescheduled weddings from the pandemic, and while life feels back to normal, the wedding industry has changed completely.  Before you say ""I do,"" you may find yourself as a bridesmaid instead of a bride.  ""We have more than we can handle, more than we could want, we turn people away but we give suggestions on where they can go,"" said Corrine Crocker-Luby, owner of the Tiffany Juliet House.  Finding a place to tie the knot is more stressful than ever before. Some brides are already booking into 2026.  Over at Glastonbury Hills Country Club, co-owner Frank Schroll said wedding dates are booking up years in advance.  ""We even get some brides that aren’t even engaged yet, they come out they know it's gonna happen soon and they want to do the leg work,"" said Schroll.  That leg work is harder than in years past.  All those pandemic-postponed ceremonies and receptions have backed up the bookings at venues around the country. All pieces and parts of the wedding industry are hoping brides and grooms have some flexibility.  ""We don’t want to hear brides have one date because more than likely it will already be taken,"" said Schroll.  That’s exactly what happened to Shannon Dolan.  ""I was thinking wedding planning starting about a year in advance was going to be fine but quickly we were learning some of the vendors were already booked,"" said Dolan.  Last summer, she found out “I do” is already planning to be said for every date for this October.  She decided on an unconventional approach to her big day. It's her own new booming business, the Mix and Mingle Mobile Bar. The drinks come to you, allowing brides to choose their wedding day in their favorite spot, on a budget. October it is for her big day, just with fewer guests than originally planned.  ""We’ve been to some weddings that are smaller guest counts and they’re some of the most fun weddings we’ve been to,"" said Dolan.  More weddings means post-pandemic love is in the air.  Back at the Tiffany Juliet House, owner Crocker-Luby has also been a wedding planner for more than two decades, now watching some relationships running right to the altar.  ""People are actually falling in love more after Covid and celebrating their union,"" said Crocker-Luby.  That means while it may be harder to lock down a time and place, couples are still celebrating their love, sometimes with just a big guest list cut.  ""After the pandemic people wanted to get together with their families so now we’re seeing a lot more intimate gatherings,"" said Tamie Myers, owner of Event Connoisseur Flowers and Gifts.  No matter the size, what’s a wedding with out flowers?  Myers' wedding business is, well, blooming.  ""Business is booming and people are looking to get back out there and have the interactions with their friends and family again,"" said Myers.  Brides and grooms are keeping the industry on its toes, trying to celebrate like normal is back in vogue.  ""I think we were cooped up too long for sure and it’s remembering what’s important in life and spending time with people you love,"" said Crocker-Luby.  Couples are finally surrounded again by family and friends, having their cake, and eating it too.  Lindsey Kane is a reporter at FOX61 News. She can be reached at Lkane@fox61.com.

Though wine on its own can make a great gift—especially if it means something unique to the couple—it’s nice to pair the bottle with something extra special. Fortunately, we’re here to help take some of the stress out of the gift-giving process with plenty of expert tips.  First, you’ll need to pick a great bottle of booze. “Giving a bottle from a vintage from the year the newlyweds met or got engaged is a fun idea and shows that you also pay attention to the milestones in their relationship,” says Janice Carnevale, event planner and wedding expert with Bellwether Events in Washington, D.C. “A custom case for them to open over several anniversaries would [also] be an incredibly thoughtful gift.”  Next, you’ll want to determine what else you plan to gift the guests of honor. “Most often, we see wine given as part of a wedding gift, often accompanied by a gift of cash or sometimes accompanied by wine glasses,” says Sara Bauleke, wedding planner and designer at Bella Notte in Washington, D.C.  But before you begin browsing, be sure to check the couple’s registry to see if they have listed any wine-centric items, suggests Carnevale. “They might have glassware, a [wine] opener or a chiller on their list, which would pair great with a bottle you pick for them,” she says.  Finally, as you search for the perfect wine-centric gift for the bride and groom-to-be, consider how much you want to shell out.  “Generally speaking, couples will expect gifts in various price ranges depending on their financial situation,” says Jacqueline Vizcaino founder of Tinted Events Design and Planning in Atlanta.  Cathy O’Connell, co-founder of COJ Events in La Quinta, California, recommends spending somewhere between $100 to $200 or more, but staying in the range of what you can afford. Remember, it’s the thought that counts. Also, keep in mind that this number can vary depending on how close you are to the couple.  Here, we break down some fantastic wedding gift ideas for wine lovers across an array of price points.  10 Best Wine Wedding Gifts  Personalized Vivid Decanter Any oenophile knows the importance of using a wine decanter. It is crucial when it comes to letting the vino “breathe” to enhance its aroma, flavor and texture—while also separating it from any solids or sediments. For one that combines functionality and style with a sweet, sentimental touch, consider this Vivid Decanter, which can be personalized with the couple’s initials. The decanter is hand-made in Europe and constructed with lightweight, lead-free crystal for added durability.

Each of the two storage zones can be individually set to 46°F, 54°F or 61°F, depending on the type of wine (i.e., reds, whites, or roses). What’s more, the wine preserver and chiller simultaneously preserve, chill and vacuum seals already-open wine bottles so that they can be enjoyed for up to 10 days. And, thanks to its compact design, it can be easily stored on the couple’s kitchen counter for easy access to their favorite bottles. $399.00 Wine Enthusiast  L'Atelier du Vin Black Matte and Wood Lever Corkscrew Any drinker can benefit from having an extra corkscrew around the kitchen. This one from L’Atelier du Vin is among the fanciest corkscrews on the market—though it’s well worth the splurge. Crafted from solid walnut wood and metal and featuring a sleek matte black coating, this single-lever corkscrew is elegant and easy to use. Simply slip it onto the bottle, push down, pull up and pour. Oh, and did we mention it includes a built-in foil cutter and ergonomic handle to ensure a sturdy, yet comfortable, grip? You can even have it personalized with the couple’s wedding date, initial or last name, so as long as it’s under eight characters. $170.00-$190.00 Wine Enthusiast  Wine Enthusiast 6-Bottle Wine Cooler Bordeaux lovers will especially adore this wine cooler, which holds and protects up to six standard-size bottles of Bordeaux. (Of course, it can also be used for other bottles, albeit not six of them.)

Finally, its compact size is suitable for small spaces, be it a kitchen counter, bar cart or somewhere else. $149.00 Wine Enthusiast","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmVtYWcuY29tLzIwMjMvMDUvMTYvYmVzdC13aW5lLXdlZGRpbmctZ2lmdC_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2019-07-25","Not Discerned","Not Discerned","Tue 16 May 2023 10:04:59","It was a discreet wedding, with immediate family and a few other attendees. But, when a photograph of the happy couple and the details of the marriage were published, the union of the mayor of Araucária and his fifth wife became headline news in the city in the southern state of Paraná and, in a heartbeat, all over Brazil. The wedding led to controversy as it took place four days after the bride turned 16, the minimum age in Brazil to legally marry with the permission of family or a judge, and because the groom is 65 years old. Eyebrows were also raised when it became known that the day before the ceremony the alderman had given his future mother-in-law a position in City Hall, appointing her councilor for culture. Despite the half-century age difference between the couple, it was this act of nepotism that raised the most outrage.  But despite the singular elements of this particular union, it is far from an uncommon event in Brazil. Last year, Brazilian notaries registered 12,509 marriages in which at least one of the participants was aged 16 or 17. That equates to 34 teenage spouses per day, the vast majority of whom were female.  A photograph of the beaming couple as Kauane Rode Camargo places a wedding ring on Hissam Hussein Dehaini swiftly went viral. The mayor’s political party moved quickly to disown him. And, in the face of a public backlash against the appointment of his mother-in-law, he soon dismissed her, although he initially pointed to her 26 years’ experience in public service as proof of her credentials.  Almost a month after the marriage, the newlyweds remain the most talked-about subject among Araucária’s population of around 140,000. “As anywhere, there are people who are for and against it,” says E. T., who asks to be identified by his initials in order to speak freely. “But I have noticed that, because he is an excellent administrator, his supporters choose not to look at the negative side, that it [the marriage] is legal, but immoral. Many have congratulated them, and wished them good luck.”  E. T. knows Dehaini personally, but his wife only by sight. He points out that the mayor is a successful businessman with interests in hotels, gas stations and airline charters that have created many jobs locally (although E. T. also mentions Dehaini was arrested on suspicion of links to drug trafficking two decades ago, according to the website G1, part of the Globo group). In his personal life, he has been married on four other occasions and has 16 children. His current wife was a recent finalist in the Miss Araucária Teen 2022 pageant. Although it is a conservative city, Araucária also hosts a beauty contest for young girls in the style of the movie Little Miss Sunshine.  Hissam Hussein Dehaini and his 16-year-old wife Kauane Rode Camargo. RR SS  Perhaps the age difference between Dehaini and Camargo did not come as much of a shock because Brazil is well-accustomed to marriages between older men and much younger women. The political elite serve as an example: President Lula da Silva is 21 years older than his wife, Janja and his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, is 27 years older than his wife Michelle. The record, though, goes to Michel Temer, president from August 2016 to December 2018, who is 43 years older than his wife, Marcela, whom he met in 2002 when he was already a veteran politician, and she was a 19-year-old newly crowned miss.  The marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, while causing controversy, has served to renew the focus on child weddings in Brazil, which remains a widespread practice. But legal marriages performed before the relevant authorities are only the tip of the iceberg, says Ana Nery Lima, a gender specialist with the NGO Plan International, who says that “informal unions in Brazil are very normalized.” The United Nations estimates that 26% of Brazilian women live with a partner before they are 18, including 6% who are not even 15. “In Brazil, when people hear the expression child marriage, they usually think of child brides of nine or 10 years old in India, but they don’t think of people they know, such as that neighbor, that aunt or their grandmother, who got married at 14,” says Lima. “In the eyes of the United Nations, child marriage is a formal or informal union in which at least one of the parties is younger than 18.” In global terms, Brazil ranks fifth in the world in terms of child marriages, with 2.2 million people falling under this category. In percentage terms, however, it is not in the top 20 worldwide, a list headed by Niger where 76% of minors cohabit with a partner before the age of 18.  In Brazil, the main reasons for this phenomenon are socioeconomic and cultural. “When two minors marry, it is usually because she is pregnant and the family wants to protect the girl’s reputation. But there are also very poor families who have many children and who think: ‘Look, at least [in another family] she will have something to eat, clothes to wear,’” says Lima. “Then there is that deep-rooted, macho culture that young women are more attractive.” The specialist notes that in weddings involving minors aged 16 and 17, the age difference between the spouses is usually around 15 years, “and this means a very large inequality of power.”  Although there were still over 12,500 legal child marriages last year in Brazil, the number of such unions has fallen by 30% since 2019 when Congress reformed the Civil Code to ban marriage before the age of 16 altogether, thus closing a loophole that ultimately allowed an adult who had raped a minor to marry her instead of going to jail, while also denying her access to abortion care, which she is entitled to by law. Any sexual relationship with someone aged under 16, consensual or not, is a crime in Brazil and no child aged under 16 can marry, regardless of whether his or her family has blessed it or not. Lima says this is a step in the right direction, but Plan International is still fighting to make marriage before the age of 18 illegal.  Following the controversy over the marriage between Dehaini and Camargo, the Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation into the Araucária mayor’s wedding and accusations of nepotism. However, as his wife is a minor, the details of the case cannot be made public.

Selecting the wedding dress was a particularly fun part of the process for Kamila, who, throughout her career as a model, has worn many. “I went to Galia Lahav for the first time and picked three different dresses,” she admits. “A week later, I went back and chose a completely different one. I just fell in love with it, and they were able to make it for me in less than a month. Record time! I’m so glad it worked out because I loved the dress and felt it was perfect for my beach wedding.”  The bride kept her jewelry pieces simple and befitting of the al fresco wedding location. She wore a classic diamond necklace, bracelet, and earrings all from Material Good. As for beauty, she worked with Lauren Hen for a sun-kissed look, and also kept her hair down to ensure it felt as natural as possible. “Less is always more,” Kamila says.  The ceremony started just after 6:30 p.m., and the service took place under a jaw-droppingly beautiful chuppah consisting of garden and spray roses, hanging amaranthus, larkspur, snapdragons, frilled lisianthus, and astrantia, all by Petal Productions. First, Oren’s older brother and his 87-year-old grandmother walked down the aisle, followed by his middle brother and his fiancée. Next, his twin brother with his wife and the couple’s niece made their way down the aisle, Oren and his both parents—and lastly, the bride was escorted by her parents, who flew in from Brazil.","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3cva2FtaWxhLWhhbnNlbi1hbmQtb3Jlbi1hbGV4YW5kZXItd2VkZGluZ9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZvZ3VlLmNvbS9zbGlkZXNob3cva2FtaWxhLWhhbnNlbi1hbmQtb3Jlbi1hbGV4YW5kZXItd2VkZGluZy9hbXA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Aric Hutchinson and at least 100 mourners gathered on Saturday at Folly Beach — the same beach where he and Samantha Miller, 34, married just hours before the deadly crash — for a memorial in honor of his late wife, CBS affiliate WCSC of Charleston reported.  Hutchinson, who sat in a wheelchair on the shoreline at the memorial, told the local station he’s “feeling pretty good” as he recovers from his injuries. He suffered a brain injury and broken bones as a result of crash, according to a GoFundMe page set up by his mother to help cover the cost of medical fees and the burial for Miller.  “My body’s getting back to where I can manage, I guess,” Hutchinson told WCSC at the memorial. “It’s just as good as I can feel with the situation, but obviously, today and the outpouring of people was just amazing. I know Sam would love it.”  “I mean, she’s a beach girl, through and through,” he added. “We do walk here almost every morning, and this is her send-off for sure. She’s up there smiling for sure.”  Aric Hutchinson and Samantha Miller. Family of Samantha Miller / AP  He and Miller had been leaving their wedding reception in a golf cart when the crash unfolded on April 28, The Associated Press reported.  A woman identified by police as Jamie Lee Komoroski, 25, was accused of slamming into the back of the golf cart while allegedly driving while drunk and over twice the speed limit, according to an incident report.  Komoroski was arrested and charged with one count of reckless homicide and three counts of felony DUI resulting in great bodily harm after the crash, according to online records, which show that she remains in police custody.  Two other people in the golf cart besides the groom were also injured, Andrew Gilreath, Folly Beach public safety department director told the AP. He added that the golf cart had lights and was authorized to drive at night.  Komoroski was not physically injured in the crash, according to a news release from city officials.  A witness reported that Komoroski “was dazed and confused” at the scene and repeatedly said “I did nothing wrong” and that she wanted to go home, according to the incident report.  That report also states that Komoroski told a sergeant on the scene that she had two drinks that night: a beer and a “tequila pineapple an hour ago or so.”  Samantha Miller's mother, Lisa Miller, told Fox News Digital that Komoroski ""chose to drink, get behind the wheel, and plow down my daughter.""  ""This is a conscious choice that a young lady made,"" Lisa Miller alleged.  Komoroski's attorney, Christopher Gramiccioni, said in a statement released last week: “We cannot fathom what the families are going through and offer our deepest sympathies. We simply ask that there not be a rush to judgment. Our court system is founded upon principles of justice and mercy and that is where all facts will come to light.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdXMtbmV3cy9odXNiYW5kLWJyaWRlLWtpbGxlZC13ZWRkaW5nLW5pZ2h0LWNyYXNoLXNheXMtZmVlbGluZy1qdXN0LWdvb2QtY2FuLXRyLXJjbmE4NDYxNtIBKmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvYW1wL3JjbmE4NDYxNg?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-05-13","Not Discerned","{""Westport"", ""Connecticut"", ""UnitedStates""}","Wed 17 May 2023 04:02:07","Just in time for the summer wedding season, Dia & Co is turning its attention to dressing brides, bridesmaids and their families and friends.  Dia & Co, which offers personal styling services and plus-size apparel, now has an online landing page called the Wedding Suite. The page, which went live last week, features 38 collections curated by Dia & Co stylists. These include “bride,” “wedding guest,” “mother of the bride and groom” and “beach wedding.” In total, the Wedding Suite contains 2,200 styles from 64 brands, including Carolina Herrera, Diane von Furstenberg, Ever-Pretty and Eloquii.  In addition to the newly-curated collections, Dia & Co launched a Wedding Styling Service for brides, bridesmaids, mothers of the bride and wedding guests. The service is free, and customers can go online to receive advice and feedback about styles and sizing. While it’s still early, the reaction to the styling service has been positive, the brand says. Dia & Co sells dresses directly via its website but also recommends certain vetted salons for those who want to design their gowns in person.  In general, the apparel market still has a long ways to go in terms of inclusion. It’s not uncommon for major retailers to start offering plus sizes, only to reduce or even eliminate offerings a couple of years later, citing cost issues or problems with demand. And while it’s true that several brands do sell plus-size wedding dresses — David’s Bridal and Anthropologie, for example — many of today’s dresses do not come in a variety of styles and silhouettes, which makes the process of finding the perfect dress even harder. In addition, as The Cut writes, bridal stores want to stock as many styles as possible, so they typically carry “as few samples as possible” for people to try on.  Nadia Boujarwah, who co-founded Dia & Co in 2015, told Modern Retail she wanted to launch the Wedding Suite after getting married 10 months ago. Finding a dress was extremely complicated, she said, as many of the boutiques she visited had few options in stock. One boutique in New York City told her she could only try on four dresses, while another asked her to just hold a dress up to her body and “see” if it would fit.  “The traditional bridal salon experience can really be very painful. For the most part, these are dresses that are made to fit very, very few women,” Boujarwah explained. “It was truly unbelievable to me how challenging it was… I got through my experience with a thick skin and a lot of help, but really came away from it feeling like there’s just so much better that we could be doing here. This is one of the last frontiers of inclusive fashion.”  The U.S. bridal wear market is a major industry, estimated to be worth $27 billion. Roughly 2.6 million couples got married in 2022, more than any year since 1984, the Wedding Report found.  Before launching the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co had a “pretty extensive” offering of wedding wear, Boujarwah said. However, it did not have true bride or bridesmaid collections, and everything was self-service. With the Wedding Suite, Dia & Co wanted “to really build out that offering of the true wedding bridal wardrobe for both our brides and an inclusive bridal party,” Boujarwah said.  For instance, while Dia & Co normally offers sizes 10 to 32, the bridesmaids’ dresses now go from sizes 0 to 40. All of Dia & Co’s Wedding Suite items come in a variety of styles, as well, with silhouettes as varied as A-line, flare, midi and floor length.  That plethora of options is crucial, Shafonne Myers, editor-in-chief of the plus-size bridal magazine Pretty Pear Bride, told Modern Retail. “So often you see style guides and selections based off of straight sizes, so to see inspiration that looks like us, it’s so refreshing and inspirational,” she said.  Gabriella Santaniello, founder of A Line Partners, explained that wedding dresses are typically sized smaller than everyday clothes, so a woman who is normally a size four in a regular dress would probably be a six or an eight in a wedding dress. However, very few salons have plus-sized samples on the rack, she explained, which throws the sizing difference off even more.  “A lot of these… brands say that they’re inclusive, but when you go to try on, there’s really nothing in your size,” Santaniello said. “So you end up squeezing yourself into a dress, if you can even do it… It’s just not a fun experience.”  Santaniello said she’s sure there’s “a cost involved” to produce plus-sized samples. “But also what would be the incremental business you’d get from it?” she asked. “Probably a lot, if a woman could come in and feel that she had a reasonable idea as to what she’d look like in the dress.”  Myers, a wedding and events planner, said there are more options now for plus-size brides than when she got married 19 years ago, But, she added, “not enough brands cater to the market.”  “In my opinion, it’s because we as a plus-size audience don’t demand it enough,” she said. “…I would love to see more of the plus-size demographic speaking up about what they want. The louder we can get as a community and demographic, the more of an impact we can have.”","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tb2Rlcm5yZXRhaWwuY28vb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9vbmUtb2YtdGhlLWxhc3QtZnJvbnRpZXJzLW9mLWluY2x1c2l2ZS1mYXNoaW9uLXdoeS1kaWEtY28taXMtbGF1bmNoaW5nLWEtcGx1cy1zaXplLXdlZGRpbmctc2VydmljZS_SAQA?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"
"wedding","2023-07-01","14:00:00","{""Watchung"", ""NewJersey"", ""UnitedStates""}","Tue 16 May 2023 13:45:10","If you haven’t already, it’s time to think about wedding decoration ideas. Just as the early bird catches the worm, the DIY wedding couple saves more money for honeymoon piña coladas. So to help you soon-to-be-newlyweds, today we’re talking about the decoration ideas that leave you inspired to take on a project or two that could save you cash. Have you secretly dreamed of being a florist? Here’s your chance to show off your petal-arranging chops. Still have the handwriting of a fourth grader? Eh, maybe book a calligrapher. So that you know what’s even possible, we’ve rounded up 39 DIY wedding decorations ideas from industry insiders across the country.  But before we dive in, here are some general tips about decorating a wedding like a pro…  Is it cheaper to do your own wedding decor?  When it comes to wedding decor, one of the biggest expenses is flowers. If you’re able (and willing) to tackle those, savings can be substantial—potentially thousands of dollars. Joan Wyndrum O’Hear, founder and owner of Blooms By The Box in Watchung, New Jersey, suggests ordering wholesale flowers and inviting family and friends (like your wedding party) to help make bouquets and boutonnieres. “Create small affordable bouquets with big blooms such as hydrangeas, peonies, or football mums paired with lush greenery,” she says. “You’ll need fewer stems when you use bigger flowers. Also, go with leafy greenery for the boutonnieres.”  How can I decorate my wedding on my own?  Beyond a glue gun (though you’ll definitely need one of those too), high-tech DIY tools make it easier than ever to decorate your wedding. Investing in a single device, such as a cutting machine like the Silhouette Cameo, for example, can make it possible to craft a slew of different DIY projects. Custom cake toppers, T-shirts for your bridesmaids, wedding signs, and programs can all be made with the same machine.  Additionally, taking a class to learn a new DIY skill might make your wedding projects, dare we say, fun. Sign up for a flower-arranging class, a candle-making workshop, a paper crafting lesson, or a calligraphy tutorial.  How can I make a cheap wedding look expensive?  Your venue will play a major role in your wedding style. And if you choose a place with built-in decor or eye-catching surroundings, you can achieve an expensive look without spending a fortune to dress up a blank-slate banquet hall. Jacqueline Vizcaino, owner of Atlanta-based Tinted Events Design and Planning, recommends opting for an outdoor wedding. “Explore natural venues instead of traditional halls,” she says. “Look for places like open-air gardens or outdoor parks where you won’t have to rely on electricity as much. This will reduce your carbon footprint and create a gorgeous backdrop for all your photos.”  What are the best decorations to use for a wedding?  “It’s always great when you choose decor that can do double duty or, even better, triple duty,” says Jamie Chang, owner and destination wedding planner at Mango Muse Events in San Francisco. “For example, a small plant or bud vase can be decor, a favor, and a place card,” she says.  For more wedding decoration ideas that pull double duty and much more, read on…","https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFyY2hpdGVjdHVyYWxkaWdlc3QuY29tL2dhbGxlcnkvd2VkZGluZy1kZWNvcmF0aW8taWRlYXMtZGl50gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJhbGRpZ2VzdC5jb20vZ2FsbGVyeS93ZWRkaW5nLWRlY29yYXRpby1pZGVhcy1kaXkvYW1w?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Wedding rings are a symbol of love and commitment, and they come in different shapes, sizes, metals, and styles. Here are some things to consider when shopping for your wedding ring.  1. What is your ring size?  Before you start looking for a wedding ring, you need to know your ring size. You can measure your finger at home using a piece of string or paper, or you can use a ring sizer tool that you can order online or get from a jeweler. You should measure your finger in two or three places depending on the size, and compare the measurements with a chart to find your ring size. You should also take into account the width and shape of the ring, as they can affect how it fits on your finger.  2. What shape do you prefer?  Wedding rings come in different shapes, such as court-shaped, D-shaped, flat, flat court, halo, and shaped.

She sipped smoothies and distributed bloat pills, as commenters suggested she was promoting unhealthy eating.  Advertisement  On Thursday, health and nutrition influencer Sam Cutler shared a ""what I ate on my wedding day"" video on TikTok, which chronicled her fastidiously healthful wedding in Boca Raton earlier this month as a gluten and dairy-free bride.  The clip, which has been viewed 4.5 million times, has sparked fierce backlash on the app, with many commenters disgracing Cutler for what they believed was promoting unhealthy eating habits.  The video begins with Cutler, who creates content under the moniker The Fit Fatale, sipping two different smoothies and being fed a grain salad by her maid of honor in the makeup chair. At the party, she notes a bottle of Arrae bloat pills have been distributed to guests, and says her chocolate wedding cake is ""gluten, dairy, and sugar-free.""  Cutler, 31, told Insider she had no idea the video would cause such a stir, given how similar it is to the rest of her content. Commenters were not only offended — some seemed angry.  ""So you forced your ED on all your guests and bridesmaids,"" a commenter wrote. She's now being called ""an almond mom,"" a term popularized on TikTok to describe adults with restrictive eating habits, and her ceremony, ""an almond wedding.""  Advertisement  The comments were ""low, hurtful, and harmful,"" the influencer said  Roughly nine years ago, the Toronto resident quit her corporate job to become a creator. She began documenting her journey to ""rebuild"" her heath in the face of several issues that arose in her twenties, including chronic bloating and adult acne.  She also endured a serious fall from a pilates class.  ""I was bedridden for about three months and really dove into trying to heal my gut and my brain at the same time,"" she said.  Nevertheless, as the video blew up over the weekend, it resulted in a spew of what Cutler called ""bullying and harassment.""  Many top commenters argued that a wedding marks a prime opportunity for indulgence and that Cutler was depriving her guests. Some went as far to say that she would be a terrible mother.  Advertisement  ""LMFAO i cannot imagine having an eating disorder themed wedding,"" reads one of the video's top comments, with 20,000 upvotes.  Cutler responded to this jab in a separate video, saying it was ""extremely low, hurtful, and harmful"" to label or diagnose someone who could possibly have mental health or body image issues.  ""If somebody is actually suffering, I think that that makes them feel more isolated,"" she told Insider.  Cutler said she didn't force guests to adhere to her diet  If anything, Cutler's intention was to inspire people with food intolerances to incorporate healthy habits when celebrating special occasions, she said.  ""I've never actually had anyone comment or attack me for eating disorders or promoting that in any way, shape, or form until this video,"" she said. Cutler added she has never been diagnosed with any type of eating disorder.  Advertisement  The creator believes some of the furor boils down to the mistaken notion that she forced her guests to hew to her diet. But guests had choices and ate standard fare, and many said it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, she said.  ""There was regular bread, we had multiple entree options that everyone was allowed to choose from at their table,"" she said. ""We had a lavish, top-shelf open bar.""  The bloat pills were optional too — stemming from a sponsorship with supplement brand Arrae, a longtime partner. (""Weddings are a really expensive time,"" Cutler said. ""If there's something you love and you can limit cost in any way, I think all the power to it."")  At the end of the day, Cutler stands by the video and says she's confident in knowing what works best for her body.  ""I'm not going to eat gluten and feel sick because it will make someone else comfortable,"" she said. ""I think the real conversation here is around removing food-shaming from social platforms … Everyone should be making the choices that work for them.""","https://news.google.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?oc=5&hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US:en"

Over the years, Kelly had served with that department and also worked as an engineer/EMT with the town of Mocks Corner, officials said.  “Drew’s passion in life was fighting fires and serving his community,” his obituary said. “He was 2021 Firefighter of the Year for the town of Moncks Corner.”  Kelly was also remembered for being a member of his church and for having a “beloved dog.” After Kelly’s death, several people flocked to social media to share their condolences.  “This loss is particularly painful for many,” the fire department said, noting that the news resonated across the Moncks Corner area.

In an cover story interview with Glamour UK on Monday, the ""Let You Love Me"" singer opened up about the planning behind her top-secret wedding to the filmmaker, 47.  ""[The wedding was planned] in two to three days, when I was out of cycle, which is what I call it when I'm not in album cycle mode,"" the 32-year-old singer told the outlet. ""His kids were there, and I really wanted them to be a part of it. It was either then or we had to wait for ages.""  She continued, ""I didn't want to do it without my stepkids there. So, we just figured it out, and we did it. And it was perfect.""  Rita Ora and Taika Waititi.

Brown, 38, in front of 200 guests in a romantic ceremony at the Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley on Saturday.  The three-day affair, planned by Ashley Smith Events, kicked off with a family dinner and welcome party on Friday night, before a full day of wedding festivities began Saturday morning.  ""The day of our ceremony, we have a disco-themed pool party,"" Underwood told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview ahead of the couple's big day. ""It's going to be a fun wedding,"" he adds, ""I'll say that!""  For their nuptials, the couple wore custom Tom Ford suits. Underwood went with a deep green, while his political strategist husband chose blue, both as a nod to the natural setting of their ""I do's.""  Olivia Rae James  ""We wanted trees around and sunshine,"" says Brown. ""It was really important for us to get married outside.""  As guests made their way to the ceremony where a choir and orchestra performed, they were greeted by a beautiful photo display designed by the couple.  ""One thing that's really important to both of us is that we've created this, we're calling it 'our loving walk,'"" explains Underwood, who appeared on The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise and The Bachelor before revealing in a 2021 interview on Good Morning America that he is gay.  ""It's inspired from a coffee table book that I was gifted after I came out called Loving and it's images of men in love throughout history. We blew them up and put them on canvases and set them around the resort,"" he says. ""Next to them will be love letters from queer people in the 18th and 19th century that were forbidden or they had to send in secret.""  Olivia Rae James  Adds Brown: ""It's really cool. It helps us to pay tribute to the people who paved the way for all same-sex couples who now can get married.""  The pair walked hand in hand down the aisle and exchanged personal vows and rings before celebrating with friends and family at the reception.  ""We wanted to break some of the traditional norms of what a ceremony and a wedding look like,"" says Underwood. ""And for the entire weekend, we recognize that a lot of people attending, both of our families and some of our friends, this will be their first queer wedding. We really want to make it special.""  Olivia Rae James  As a fun surprise, the couple arranged for Stanford University's artistic swimming team to perform in the pool as everyone exited the ceremony. 'We wanted to keep the energy going,"" says Brown. ""I like to host and bring people together. It's our wedding, but it's also a three-day party that we are throwing for our nearest and dearest.""  At the reception, guests dined family style on salads, vegetables, steak, fish and pasta. ""And lots of spicy margaritas,"" says Brown of their specialty 21 Seeds Tequila cocktails which included two cucumber and jalapeño infused drinks dedicated to the couple's dogs Scout and Zooka.

""I've never been more sure about something. He has the biggest heart and he's such a good friend to all of the people in his life. He goes out of his way to take care of his friends and his family. That speaks volumes. It was one of the first things that I noticed about him.""  The pair first met at a party in Los Angeles in April 2021, and got engaged in Feb. 2022 in Big Sur, Calif.
