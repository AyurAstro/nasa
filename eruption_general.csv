But there was enough noise coming from the Owls’ sideline, as their rowdy enthusiasm permeated the stadium after every caused turnover, every Alex Epple save and every goal.  Advertisement  The biggest eruption came when the clock hit zeros and the top-seeded Owls rushed to celebrate with the crowd after beating two-time defending national champion Nassau Community College out of New York, 13-8.  “This is what we look forward to, we train for,” said Epple, who finished with seven saves. “Coach [Aaron Verardi] came out and beginning of the season instilled a mindset in us that [if] you want to be a champion, you have to act like a champion on and off the field every day. Our boys really took that to heart, and we came out on top in the end.”  Advertisement  The sounds of celebration lingered in the background as Verardi, the eighth-year Harford coach, took a moment to sum up his emotions after leading the program to its first national championship.

(Anthony Maluso)  “It’s all come full circle,” he said. “I think back to when I started coaching here, and this was almost like a dream back then. We’ve had so many guys that bought in and so many guys believing in us in the program here.  “This team is unreal. They’re undefeated and never had any doubt. I never doubted this team all year long and it built up to this point. Just an amazing group.”  The game was tight for 35 minutes. Though Harford (12-0) led most of it, they couldn’t build much separation from the Lions (13-2). Harford led, 5-3, at halftime, and the teams exchanged goals early in the third quarter. But over a roughly eight-minute stretch, Harford broke the game open with four straight goals, turning a two-goal lead into a comfortable six.  “We kind of came out with a game plan of just playing fast and really trying to push the pace of the game,” Verardi said. “Nassau is a very good, disciplined team that will tend to slow it down. We wanted to force the game to be played at our pace. I think eventually we started noticing a couple things defensively on their end that we could take advantage of, and our guys did a great job and executed.”  Dylan Tomarchio scored three of his game-high five goals in the third quarter.

We saw a zone yesterday [in a semifinal against CCBC-Essex] and we were doing really well. Coach said it’s 0-0 at halftime, just like any other game.”  Meanwhile, Epple was a wall. Nassau struggled to get clean looks at the goal, and several passes sailed away from teammates and out of bounds. When they did get solid opportunities, Epple was there more times than not to shut the door.  Advertisement  “I started off a little slow in the first half, but I think it was more about settling in that we were playing on the big stage,” he said. “Once I was settled in and locked in, everything took care of itself.”  Harford lifted the championship trophy and became the best team in the country by putting an emphasis on a team-first mentality.  “I think everyone definitely had a part in it today,” Collins said. “Nassau is a great team and I was super proud of our guys at the faceoff ‘X.’ Our defense is always stout and then our offense kind of got in a groove there just running our stuff.”  Harford spread out its 13 goals among six players. Tomarchio led with five, and Collins and Trevor Sousa each scored twice with two assists.  “Top to bottom, this whole roster is loaded with talent,” Collins said. “Our chemistry over the years has definitely grown, but everyone is super unselfish. We just like to see the team succeed. Our saying is, ‘We-ball not me-ball,’ and that’s what showed today.”"

After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. “It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds, and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” first-year Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting in a largely anonymous showing, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for the 76ers. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year and the fifth time in six seasons. They have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. … I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,” Brown said. “He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  BANGED-UP BROWN  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  WHAT’S UP, DOC?  Rivers is 6-10 in Game 7s. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL’s Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: “Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,” Embiid said. “We’ve got what it takes to win. … I still believe me and him have the chance to win. But it’s going to take more than us.”  TIP-INS  Tatum is the sixth player since 1997 to score 25 points or more in the first half of a seventh game. The last was Luka Doncic, who had 29 against the Clippers in the first round of the 2021 playoffs. Paul Pierce scored 26 for the Celtics against Cleveland in the second round in 2008. … The 10 points Philadelphia scored were tied for the fewest in any Game 7 quarter in the shot clock era."

The service was suspended on May 9 after Shamshabad, 6th Road, and Faizabad metro stations were vandalized by the protesters. The protesters also broke glasses and CCTV cameras and damaged the washrooms of the Committee Chowk Station. The protesters also looted nearly Rs 0.5 million from the ticketing booth of the Sixth Road station. The whole station and ticketing booths were destroyed.

The most seriously injured, a female, was rescued by Anderson Police officers from the midst of the chaos who then stopped the bleeding from her wounds to help deliver the victim to a local hospital before she was airlifted to Indianapolis for more intensive care.  The oldest victims were 21 years old, the youngest was a 14-year-old boy.  ”Gunshots like a war. Like a war,” said Bobbie Taylor, owner of Sonny Ray’s, a longtime nightclub at the corner of 16th Street and Madison Avenue. “I looked out and that’s when I saw all the police down here. And the ambulance. When I peeked out the window when I heard the gunshots, I saw people running.”  Five of the victims transported themselves to Anderson hospitals.  Investigators found witnesses were reluctant to cooperate, leaving detectives to rely on pole-mounted surveillance cameras.  “Usually we get our best evidence on Facetime live, facetime posts actually showing some of the shootings,” said Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings. “That’s what usually happens.”  Cummings said the same intersection was the site of another mass shooting in the summer of 2022 that left two dead among the five wounded.  ”Its crowds and kids, it really is,” said Cummings. “And kids with guns at two or three in the morning is a formula for a serious problem.”  Taylor said the violence happens in the street involving minors too young to come into her bar.  ”This is where people come and hang out,” she said. “This has been going on for years. Everybody’s got guns out here. A lot of us are scared because you see 14 and 15-year-olds walking down the street with extended clips hanging out. And as a business owner, what are we to do?”  Taylor was joined by several supporters and other business owners, police, pastors, the Anderson chapter of the Ten Point Coalition and neighbors at a rally outside the bar Sunday night.  ”I think there should be some kind of curfew called to where after a certain time, and I feel the police should be able to stop if they see somebody walking down the street and they look like they’re 10, 13-years-old with extended clips hanging out their pockets,” she said. “I feel like they should be able to stop them, ID them or whatever. They’re not old enough. Take them home, take those guns to their parents or whatever.”  Aside from Cummings, noticeably absent from the rally the night after the shootings were the political leadership of Anderson including Mayor Thomas Broderick, Jr., who recently squeezed through his party’s primary election, and the city councilor who represents Anderson’s west side, as residents debated among themselves as to a solution to the crowds, violence and disruption that they say is common several nights a week once the weather turns warm.  ”There need to be signs out here and hire enforcement and not let those big crowds congregate out here,” said Cummings as he surveyed the private parking lot where crowds and vehicles gather. “As soon as nice weather comes out on the weekends, that’s what usually happens.”"

Wapahani and Delta were in a classic pitcher's duel, locked at 1-1 after five innings and fighting for Saturday's Delaware County baseball championship at Yorktown High School. Raiders senior Gavin Lash and Eagles junior Kayden Thomas repeatedly exchanged blows on the mound, and neither offense could muster a breakthrough hit with runners on base.  Then, with two outs in the top of the sixth inning, Wapahani senior and former Eagle Daniel Blevins crushed one into the night sky and over the left field wall, erupting his team's dugout as the two-run homer gave the Raiders a lead they'd never relinquish.  ""I was just trying to put something in the gap,"" Blevins said. ""Saw fastball in, got around on it.""  ""I don't think I stopped screaming until the inning was over,"" Lash said. ""It was amazing. He hit the cap out of that ball.""  Senior Paul Fisher added a sac fly RBI in the top of the seventh frame to give Wapahani some extra breathing room, and Lash closed out his complete-game effort to top Delta 4-1 for the Raiders' second county title in three seasons.  It was a true team effort as the contest could've went either way on several occasions. Each team tallied six hits, played good defense and got top-notch pitching performances, yet Wapahani made the key plays when it mattered most.  That has, uncharacteristically, not been the case for the Raiders for much of this season. While the program has been a perennial powerhouse under 40-year head coach Brian Dudley, Wapahani began 2023 with a 9-8-1 record, a stark contrast to the team's 20-plus-win campaigns every year since 2018.  Graduating multiple key contributors from last season's regional-championship squad was a significant factor in the slow start, but Dudley, Lash and Blevins all alluded to a lack of chemistry as well.  It wasn't until two weeks ago that Dudley felt his boys ""got tired of losing"" and finally came together to play for one another. Their ""timely hitting"" is coming around, and they've won five straight games ever since.  ""We kind of were playing for ourselves to start,"" Blevins said. ""But now I think we're finally a team, and I love it.""  ""We lost to everyone in this county except Cowan in the regular season,"" Lash said. ""We have very good talent, more talent than a lot of teams do, and we are starting to finally play together and play for each other and play as brothers.""  More:Cowan wins first Delaware County softball championship in program history  Lash spearheaded Wapahani's opening and concluding Delaware County tournament victories. He tossed his first career no-hitter in Tuesday's 3-0 win against Daleville and rose to the occasion in the championship, pitching a complete game with seven strikeouts to just five hits allowed.  His lone walk and earned run came in the fourth inning with the bases loaded, a moment when the game could've easily swung in Delta's favor. The circumstances, which might've unraveled a less seasoned pitcher, only heightened Lash's focus as he tallied the final two outs of the frame to escape with the game tied 1-1.  ""I kept my composure really good and I felt completely in control the whole game,"" Lash said.  More:Delta track and field wins Delaware County title; 9 records broken overall by all teams  Dudley said that moment embodied the player Lash has become. Previously a significant piece on two of the program's best teams in recent history, Lash has developed into the steady senior presence the Raiders needed during their rough start.  Even if his statistics haven't been as eye-catching this season as in previous ones, his talent and experience gives his team an edge in key situations.  ""He's starting to understand that everybody will feed off him,"" Dudley said. ""He's kept his composure a lot better, especially this year.""  Lash and Blevins wouldn't have gotten the chance to shine, however, if not for Wapahani's comeback 5-3 semifinal win against Yorktown on Thursday, a game played two days earlier than originally scheduled due to weather.  In the original tournament format, Lash likely would've faced the Tigers instead. But with matchup moved up, sophomore Nate Luce got the start and did well, allowing three runs, two earned, over four innings.  Senior Daxton Dudley threw the final three innings in relief, allowing just one hit and zero runs. Down 3-1 after the fourth frame, his shutdown showing gave the Raiders' offense the necessary time to find a rhythm in the box and they exploded for four runs over the fifth and sixth innings to complete a comeback victory.  ""Those guys were awesome because that's a very good team,"" Dudley said of Luce and Daxton. ""Yorktown was the favorite coming in, and I pulled them aside after the game and said, 'You guys did one heck of a job,' because one through nine they can hit. We just kept them off base and kept fighting and scored at the end.""  Luce was a major contributor again against Delta, hitting 3-for-3 and making a key defensive play at shortstop. Wapahani played sound defense all evening, highlighted by senior Joe Foster's diving catch in centerfield in the second inning that stranded an Eagles runner on base.  Every play was significant against the ""good young group"" that is Delta, according to Dudley, especially since the Eagles (8-14) have recovered from a 1-8 start to this spring.  Dudley said defense and pitching have been the team's strengths all season, and Lash commended his teammates for their continued commitment to that facet of the game.  ""They really helped me out. For example, I wouldn't have had that no-hitter without some good plays that we made,"" Lash said. ""Everyone trusts each other and they play their hearts out for me.""  Wapahani has just five more games scheduled before the postseason begins, and the Raiders hope this tournament title springboards the group toward another postseason run.  The Radiers passed this test and will need to continue playing with chemistry and confidence to achieve their goals. In the short term, they'll celebrate adding another trophy to their illustrious program, one that Lash feels more proud of than than the county championship they won two years ago.  ""As a sophomore, we were very, very good, so we kind of just ran through teams, and this year we've got to work for a little bit more,"" Lash said. ""We've got to trust each other more.

It was so important for me to do something good in such complex and difficult days,"" said the 23-year-old Jewish judoka, after her dramatic victory in the 78 kg final over Frenchwoman Audrey Tschumeau.  It was the first time in her senior career that Lanir stood on the first place podium, and there is nothing sweeter than doing it in the most prestigious international competition. Although she was marked from a young age as a potential star, she was not able to make the long-awaited breakthrough since she won the European Under-23 Championship three years ago.  In the eyes of the Qatari audience, though, exactly at the moment of truth – about a year before the Paris Olympics – everything was released and Israeli judoka received a tremendous shot of encouragement.  The achievement came during a difficult year for the Jewish athlete. In the previous world championship she was eliminated in her first fight, and her participation in the Tel Aviv Grand Slam ended in tears after she lost in the battle for bronze. On Friday, the tears that flowed were of pure happiness. And how could she not be? She is the second Israeli woman in the sport to be crowned world champion, after her role model Yarden Gerbi did it 10 years before her.  A winning bet  Lanir is considered an attractive judoka, one who tends to take risks in matches. It can lead her to impressive wins like in Doha, or end up in a quick loss as has happened to her quite a few times. This time the bet had a big payoff: She was aggressive in all five of her bouts and showed particularly good offense. It was not a tactical style, and she did not try to extract penalties from her opponent.  3 View gallery Inbar Linor tests her gold medal ( Photo: Karim Jaafar / AFP )  Lanir was born in Yokne'am in northern Israel before moving with her family to Yehud, where she began her journey in judo. As a young girl, it was not clear what direction she would take. She loved ballet very much, but when she got on the judo mat for the first time it was clear that this was something to consider.  At a certain point her mother pressured her to give judo a chance in light of the positive feedback she received from the coaches. And so, Lanir would come to training in ballet clothes, throw a white uniform over them, and immediately become a tough warrior. Lanir says that ballet actually helped her in judo and improved her ability to move.  Lanir acknowledges that she was a hyperactive child, so she also experimented with sports such as floor gymnastics and aerial acrobatics, but judo attracted her more than anything - even though she was still in a dilemma. Her childhood coach, Shimi Assor, said: ""Inbar came to training in ballet clothes and told me that she was debating whether to quit because she was told that judo is a boy's sport. I told her that soon there will be the Israeli judo championships, and let's see what happens after that.""  In a post she published on Instagram, Lanir spoke openly about dealing with body image as a female judoka: ""I wasn't ready to lift a barbell that weighed more than 2 kg. and whose color wasn't pink. I was afraid to be muscular. I was afraid to look masculine. It was important to me to be beautiful; my dream was that the boys in the class would fight over who would invite me to slow dance at the bat mitzvah. I believed that if my hands were bigger than theirs, it would lessen my chances.""  3 View gallery Inbar Linor at the World Judo championships ( Photo: Karim Jafaar / AFP )  Lanir went on to describe the moment she decided to change course: ""My mother took me to see the Israel Senior Championships. I sat there mesmerized. The matches did not interest me at that moment. My eyes were locked on the sidelines where all the athletes of the national team were gathered. I studied every millimeter of their bodies, which of course were covered in judo suits, which made me continue my detective work at home. I memorized their names and looked them all up on Facebook. I went through photo after photo until I found one athlete who had a photo in a dress. And she looked just great. I was really surprised. She was very feminine and cute, and she had muscles, but she was really beautiful. A week later I went to the gym and started lifting weights. My arms grew bigger, and the terrible disaster I feared did not happen.""  Lanier adds that ""I continued to dress the way I like, and dress up and put on makeup, and feel feminine and beautiful. To this day, I stand in front of the mirror and flatter myself. Because my muscles are my most beautiful jewelry. So, I'm writing this post for the 12-year-old girl I was. For those girls who are debating whether to take the heavier weight because they are afraid of how their body will look. Being strong is so beautiful, and true beauty comes from within. And when you stand with the medal around your neck in the most important competition of your life, you will thank yourself for the decision to choose to be strong.""  Hard work to go pro  So, Lanir overcame her fears and found herself on Israel's national team at the age of 13. Of course, the commitment to becoming a professional judoka had a price: the competitions on Saturday, giving up the annual school trips and parties on the weekends. She was absent from high school quite a bit due to morning training, but in the end she finished her high school requirements on her own."

The Wolverines had been trading goals with No. 8 Cornell all game, neither team ever able to amass a lead greater than two. Pushed into sudden death overtime, Michigan knew it was now or never as the Wolverines fought to keep their dream-like season alive — and yet they weren’t worried.  “We tend to feel comfortable being uncomfortable,” Thompson said.  Down an elite attacker and one of its best facilitators, sophomore Ryan Cohen, and with senior attacker Josh Zawada effectively neutralized by the Big Red’s All-American defenseman Gavin Adler, Michigan needed someone to step up and score. Junior attacker and All-Big Ten First Team awardee Michael Boehm seemed the logical pick, especially coming off the hat trick that solidified him as the program’s single-season goal record holder.  Luckily for Michigan, Cornell thought so too.  Just over a minute into overtime, Boehm skirted the endline, looking for an opening and taking short jabs towards the crease. Graduate attacker Bryce Clay set a screen for Boehm behind the Big Red’s goal, rolling out to the left wing as his defender attempted to double-team the star scorer. As the defenders converged on Boehm, he whipped the ball over to Clay, who rocketed it into the pocket of Thompson. On a beautiful cut in from the wing, Thompson’s momentum propelled the ball into the net, and the Wolverines erupted from the sideline.  “It’s been a plethora of guys all season,” Thompson said. “(Michigan offensive coordinator Scott) Bieda … does a great job of going with the hot hand sometimes, and … I guess that was me today.”  Thompson stepped up at multiple moments during Sunday’s NCAA Tournament matchup, beginning in the very first quarter. With just over a minute left in the first period, he took a long shot from the wing, knotting the score up at four before the quarter break.  “(Thompson)’s the Energizer Bunny,” Michigan coach Kevin Conry said. “Not only has he contributed significantly with points and playing time, but his energy on a day in and day out basis has really boosted our roster. It’s been great.”  Three quarters later, both teams seemed to be running out of gas — except for Thompson. Notching two goals, only 36 seconds apart, to lock in a hat trick and give Michigan the lead with less than five minutes to go, he provided the jolt of energy the Wolverines had been lacking. Unfortunately for Michigan, though, Cornell found its second wind as well.  Ground balls turned into football-style runs, with bodies and sticks flying. Another Boehm goal led to him getting kneed in the head in front of the crease. The first and only penalty of the game, a holding by Michigan, was called. But neither team could seal the deal. The whistle blew for overtime just as the Wolverines managed to get the ball away from the Big Red.  “They were dog tired,” Conry said.  Thompson, living up to his “Energizer Bunny” persona, shocked Michigan back into rhythm with his fourth and final goal in overtime. The Wolverines stormed the field to the sound of The Victors echoing over Schoellkopf Field — their mythical season (and chance at a national championship) still alive.  “I think the guys have so much belief this year that … the fruits of our labors are going to come to fruition,” Thompson said.  Any garden takes time to flourish, as long as one is willing to put in the work required. Last year, Michigan did a lot of the weeding. Sunday, it was Thompson’s turn to break through the ivy and bloom. And as the Wolverines use the victory to climb higher and higher up the trellis of the NCAA Tournament, facing No. 1 Duke next Sunday, they can only hope that the season they’ve been cultivating comes up roses."

According to the statement, the Secretary-General commended Egypt’s key role in bringing the hostilities to an end, alongside the efforts of Qatar, Lebanon and the United States to reach a ceasefire.  “He calls on all sides to observe the ceasefire,” the statement continued, adding that Mr. Guterres reaffirmed the United Nations’ commitment to the achievement of the two-State solution based on relevant United Nations resolutions, international law, and prior agreements and the importance of restoring a political horizon.  “He reiterates that only a negotiated sustainable political solution will lead to lasting peace and end, once and for all, these devastating cycles of violence,” the statement concluded.  UN looks forward to restoration of humanitarian access  On Saturday, the UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, Tor Wennesland, issued a similar statement welcoming the ceasefire, commending Egypt’s efforts to help restore calm, and calling on all sides to respect the truce.  “I am deeply saddened by the loss of life and injuries, including children and women, from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and the indiscriminate firing of rockets toward Israel by Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other militant groups,” said Mr. Wennesland, expressing his deepest condolences to the families of the victims of the violence and their loved ones.  In the wake of the ceasefire, the UN Special Coordinator said that he looked forward “to the immediate restoration of humanitarian access and all social and economic measures to support Palestinian livelihoods in Gaza.”"
