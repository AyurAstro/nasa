But a flurry of hard hit balls and two big innings from its senior leaders allowed it to crawl back and earn the decisive victory.  The Wolverines (26-22 overall, 13-8 Big Ten) prevailed on senior day behind the power of their bats to sweep Northwestern (8-38, 3-18) by a score of 15-5.  Coming off of a Big Ten Pitcher of the Week performance against Minnesota, senior left-hander Jacob Denner looked to stay hot on the mound. But, stymied early by the Wildcats‚Äô offense, Michigan entered an early hole, giving up two runs quickly in the first inning.  With Denner unable to replicate his dominance from a week ago in the early innings, the Wolverines needed their bats to keep them in the game ‚Äî and they delivered. In the bottom of the third inning the bats unleashed, as back-to-back doubles from graduate shortstop Cody Jefferis and senior second baseman Ted Burton drove in two RBI to bring Michigan within one run.  ‚ÄúI like a hot Teddy,‚Äù Michigan coach Tracy Smith said. ‚ÄúWhen he‚Äôs hot, he‚Äôs fun to watch. That‚Äôs what your older guys are supposed to do, is lead by example and through their play. He‚Äôs doing an excellent job of that.‚Äù  But the best was still to come for the Wolverines.  The next inning, senior third baseman Brandon Lawrence ignited a two-out onslaught with an RBI single, followed by home runs from Jefferis and Burton ‚Äî Jefferis‚Äô first homer of the season and Burton‚Äôs third in just this series. Michigan entered the bottom of the fourth down by one, but exited up by four.  After the early blows, the Wolverines used the crucial bottom of the fourth inning to retake all momentum, only needing to close out the rest of the game ‚Äî and series.  Continuing that momentum, Denner‚Äôs pitching began to smooth, allowing just two more runs in the top of the seventh before handing off to senior right-hander John Torroella with a three run Michigan lead.  ‚ÄúEven with the hits, (Denner) didn‚Äôt give up much solid contact,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúFollowing up his unbelievable performance from last week is what we‚Äôre gonna need him to do.‚Äù  While not equal to his career best performance last weekend, Denner still kept the Wolverines in position to hold their lead.  While the lead was safe at the time of Denner‚Äôs exit, it needed insurance. And that is where Jefferis re-enters the equation.  With the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning, the senior roped a triple down the right field line. The hit scored all three runners, bolstering a six-run inning to close out a cycle performance at the plate for Jefferis.  ‚ÄúThat really spread it open there,‚Äù Smith said. ‚ÄúNot only did it give him the cycle, but we were just saying, ‚ÄòGosh, we need one more run just to kind of get away,‚Äô ‚Ä¶ so the triple was big.‚Äù  He delivered the knockout shot. By piling on six runs in the seventh inning, Michigan had replicated and gone beyond what it did in its dominant fourth inning. The game was no longer in reach for Northwestern and the Wolverines achieved their lead on the backs of their seniors.  Earning the series sweep against the Wildcats is essential to Michigan‚Äôs hopes of another Big Ten Tournament run. And the final victory on Sunday shows that the Wolverines‚Äô bats are heating up at just the right time."

Syracuse basketball 2024 four-star target Mikey Lewis is a scoring machine.  This past Friday through Sunday, the EYBL is holding its third spring session at the Southwest Athletic Center in Carrollton, Texas.  According to the EYBL Web site, on Friday evening, the Oakland Soldiers defeated the Detroit-based The Family, 79-67.  In 28 minutes, Lewis tallied 29 points, five rebounds and two assists. He connected on 9-of-16 from the field, 5-of-10 from beyond the arc and 6-of-6 from the free-throw line.  On Saturday morning, the Oakland Soldiers crushed the Miami-based Nightrydas Elite by a final count of 91-70. In this victory, Lewis recorded 26 points, three boards, one assist and three steals in only 20 minutes.  He hit on 8-of-14 from the field, 5-of-8 from downtown and 5-of-5 from the charity stripe.  In late April, when the EYBL held two sessions during live periods, Lewis produced scoring outbursts of 34 points, 22 points, 22 points, 23 points and 28 points, among others.

Astronomers recently reported the observation of what appeared to be a large gas planet being eaten up by its aging star. The team said the sun-like star had been expanding for a very long time and finally got so big that it swallowed the nearby planet.  The researchers who made the observations said the star is in our Milky Way galaxy, about 12,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year ‚Äì about 9.5 trillion kilometers. The findings were recently reported in a study published in Nature.  Most planets are believed to meet the end of their life when the star they are orbiting runs out of energy. This process causes the star to turn into a ‚Äúred giant‚Äù that grows very large. The star can then swallow up the planet, and anything else that nears it.  The scientists say the planet‚Äôs destruction happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation. At that time, the star was around 10 billion years old. The team said the swallowing event created a hot explosion of light, followed by a large release of dust that shot out into space.  Kishalay De is a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He discovered the light explosion by accident in 2020. He was examining data captured by the Palomar Observatory, based near San Diego, California.  De said he was surprised to observe a star that had suddenly increased in brightness by more than 100 times over a period of 10 days. He had been searching for binary star systems. These are sets of two stars that orbit around a common center of mass. When the larger of the stars takes bites out of the other, a bright explosion called an ‚Äúoutburst‚Äù happens.  But De said his examinations suggested the outburst was surrounded by cold gas, meaning it could not be a binary system. He learned from another space telescope that the star had also started releasing large amounts of dust months before the outburst.  While scientists had observed past star expansions, this was the first time they have been able to observe a complete planet-swallowing event.  The researchers said the collected data showed the swallowed planet was a ‚Äúgas giant‚Äù with a similar mass to the planet Jupiter. They noted that the planet had become so close to its star that it could complete a full orbit in just one day.  The planet is believed to have ‚Äúengulfed‚Äù the planet over a period of around 100 days, the team said. The bright explosion happened in the final 10 days as the planet was totally destroyed.  Miguel Montarges is an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the research. He told the French news agency AFP the star was thousands of degrees hotter than the planet when the destruction happened. He explained, ""It's like putting an ice cube into a boiling pot.""  Astronomers say the same event is expected to happen to other planets ‚Äì including Mercury, Venus and Earth. De said our sun will likely reach its red giant period in about 5 billion years.  Astronomers do not know if more planets are circling the star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before also getting swallowed up.  Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be looking for more similar events. They believe thousands of planets around other stars will likely suffer the same fate as this one did.  Morgan MacLeod is a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. He told Reuters news agency he finds it ‚Äúhumbling‚Äù to think about our own planet facing the same destruction. MacLeod noted that since Earth is much smaller, its destruction will not cause such an outburst.  ‚ÄúWhen Earth is eventually swallowed, the sun will hardly notice,"" he said.  I‚Äôm Bryan Lynn.

Most of the improvisations have saved them money and helped to keep heads above water.  However, the new way of boycotting the high cost of cooking gas cylinders may cost lives than it can save money.  Economy&Lifestyle discovered that the cost of gas cylinders has risen so high that it becomes difficult for average homes to afford and still fill them with gas.  The situation becomes worse when considering that the pump price of kerosene, which would have been an alternative, is prohibitive.  Checks show that the price of cylinders varies according to the sizes. A 3kg gas cylinder costs N14,000, 5kg-N16,000 6kg ‚Äì N17,000 and 12.5kg costs N19,000. Filling the cylinders with cooking gas also costs N2,600 for 3kg, N5,200 for 6kg, N8,950 for 10.5kg and N10,650 for 12.5 kg.  This means that an average home with a worn-out 5kg will need N20,250 to buy a new one and fill it, which is hard to come by.  So, the resolve is to refurbish the old ones and still manage them. However, that is where the danger is.  Mrs. Rukayat Adesoji, a trader, said her gas cylinder got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month, but due to high cost of purchasing the cylinders, she took it to a welder who patched the legs, repainted it, and since then, she has been using it.  ‚ÄúMy gas cylinder which was 6kg got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month. When I asked for the price, I was told it was N17, 500. I was discussing it with a friend who advised me to take it to a welder to paint it and construct a new stand. I heeded to her advice and at the end spent just N3, 000 to turn my cooking gas to a brand new.‚Äù  Apart from refurbishing cylinders, some people don‚Äôt even know when their cylinders will expire. Mrs. Mercy Opara, a hair stylist, fell in that category as she explained: ‚ÄúI am taking my gas cylinder to the welder to spray it for me. It just cost N1, 500. The cost of buying a new cylinder is high. I have been using my cylinder for over 7 years and I don‚Äôt even know the expiry date. I just pray God blesses me so that I can buy a new one. But this one I am managing will look neat after spraying it for another two years.‚Äù  Mr. Adekanbi Joseph, a wielder, said he paints cylinder and ‚ÄúTo paint and rebuild a cylinder stand, I charge N4, 500. Many people come here to paint as a new cylinder is now very expensive to get.‚Äù  Explaining the danger in using refurbished cylinders, The Chief Executive Officer, FKT Cooking gas and general goods, Mr. Benjamin Hope said: ‚ÄúA brand new cylinder can explode if the locks are not well keyed after using and if the cylinder filled with gas was moved from one place.  ‚ÄúThere are many reasons for the high cost of gas cylinders in Nigeria. One is the cost of importation due to the exchange rate. Another is the increased migration from the use of kerosene to cooking gas which has necessitated increased demand for gas cylinders.  ‚ÄúYou know that in such a case there will be increased importation of cylinders.‚Äù"

The Vanderpump Rules reality star put on a casual display in an off-white sweatshirt with the matching joggers as she headed out to run errands in Beverly Hills  The model was also seen toting around a mini backpack in a gray leather fabric and gold hardware.  She donned a dazzling diamond statement ring on her hand with a stunning, long, and taupe manicure.  The cocktail book author opted for a makeup-free look to showcase her natural beauty.  Earlier last week, fans of Vanderpump Rules caught a sneak peek of the tense season ten three-part reunion.  In the trailer, Madix called out her now-ex, Tom Sandoval, 39, and slammed his mistress for being 'diabolical, demented, and subhuman'.  The former pageant queen, 28, had admitted that having an affair her close friend's boyfriend of nearly a decade was 'super selfish'.  In response, Madix quickly clapped back and said: 'Selfish does not cover it.'  For the rest of the trailer, Madix and the rest of the cast fired no shortage of insults at Sandoval and his mistress.

He also co-hosts Cash Considerations: A Chicago Bulls Podcast for the Blue Wire Network.  Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla changed his starting lineup for Game 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers, inserting big man Robert Williams III and moving Derrick White to the bench. While the Celtics were on the ropes in the fourth quarter and needed both a late Jayson Tatum explosion and Sixers collapse to win, the move undoubtedly worked given Boston‚Äôs fast start to the game and Williams‚Äô plus-18 in the box score. Because of this, it‚Äôs no surprise Mazzulla is sticking with this lineup for Sunday‚Äôs Game 7.  Mazzulla spoke to the media before the do-or-die game and confirmed he will keep the two-big starting lineup in place against Joel Embiid and Co., per ESPN‚Äôs Tim Bontemps. That means it will be Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford going up against Philly.  Williams played 28 minutes in Game 6, his highest playing time of the series. The big man was under 20 minutes in the prior three games and had played a high of 22 points in Game 2 before Game 6. He made his presence known with 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in those 28 minutes. And, again, the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 18 points when Williams was on the court.

If they can get up early and get the crowd into it, the Sixers will be in big trouble. It‚Äôs going to be a fascinating Game 7 with an Eastern Conference Finals date against the Miami Heat on the line."

The photographer, Boris Eldagsen, openly admitted that the image was AI generated and refused to accept the award, saying he had entered it to start a debate over whether an AI-generated image could in fact be a photograph.  The stunt was a response to an explosion in readily accessible AI tools. Last November‚Äôs launch of ChatGPT was, on the face of it, one of the most momentous technological advances in recent years. A text-based system, ChatGPT can write stories, college essays, job applications and so on in clear, fluent language and, if the user so chooses, in the style of Shakespeare, Donald Trump or Chaucer.  It clocked up over 100 million users in the first two months after launch, making it the fastest growing consumer application in history. And, less than four months after ChatGPT hit the headlines, OpenAI, the developer, launched GPT-4, the successor to GPT-3, the artificial intelligence system on which ChatGPT is based."
