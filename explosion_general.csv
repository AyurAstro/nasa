The fire broke out at a plant near Galveston Bay, a heavily industrialized area on the Texas coast, at approximately 9:30 a.m. Central Time.  Marathon Petroleum said it was investigating the cause of the blaze. There were no immediate reports of additional injuries.  The company said it would monitor air quality in the nearby community as a precaution.  Texas City police said the fire had been contained by Monday afternoon and was not at risk of spreading to other facilities.  In a statement to the Associated Press, Marathon said ""The safety of our workers and the community is our top priority, and a full investigation will be conducted to determine the cause of the incident.""  In 2005, an explosion at this same facility killed 15 people and injured 180 others. At the time it was owned by BP. Marathon Petroleum bought the facility in 2013.

During this, the police also brought the main accused of the blasts, Azadbir Singh, to the spot. The entire scene was recreated by Azadbir Singh under the supervision of the police. Not only this, the angle from which the photograph was taken was also scrutinised.  Police officials were not allowed to capture the scene for the media. At present, all five accused are being interrogated by the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA).  During the investigation, it was found that before the blast and arrest, Azadbir Singh of Baba Bakala had spent a day in Tarn Taran and Gurdaspur respectively. The police suspect that Azadbir Singh had links with the smugglers involved in cross-border drug smuggling.  The police are also investigating the call details and call locations of Azadbir Singh and Amrik Singh for the last three months to know their links, contacts and area of the movement.  It is worth mentioning here that Azadbir Singh, Amrik Singh, firecracker dealer Sahib Singh alias Saba, Dharminder Singh and Harpreet Singh were arrested by the police for their alleged involvement in the three blasts near the Golden Temple last week.

At first the tremors, which were registered on Saturday, were thought to have been caused by earthquakes.  Then, seismologists theorised that they originated from controlled explosions in Poland, almost 90 miles to the south, as part of military exercises.  But they are still not certain of the true origin of the unexplained geological phenomenon.  FILE PHOTO: Gas leak at Nord Stream 2 as seen from the Danish F-16 interceptor on Bornholm, Denmark September 27, 2022  On Monday, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, an official body that monitors the underground, said the tremors were 'not caused by earthquakes, but by pressure waves from an event in the atmosphere.'  However, they came from 'an unknown source.'  'The seismologists can report that it is unlikely that the tremors originate from a controlled explosion in Poland, which was carried out shortly before the first reports of tremors on Bornholm,' the body known as GEUS said in a statement.  On Saturday, GEUS said it had received 'more than 60' tips from people on Bornholm that 'earthquake-like tremors' - described as a deep rumbling, shaking and rattling, changing pressure in the ear - had been reported in the afternoon on Bornholm.  This map, created shortly after the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline were detected, shows the location of the Danish island of Bornholm  Police said they too were contacted by members of the public about the tremor on the eastern part of the island.  Danish media reported that the tremors caused a crack in the wall of a house, but no one was hurt.  GEUS said that seismic tremors were measured at a magnitude of 2.3.  Polish authorities have said that there was intensive activity during the Anakonda23 exercise in Ustka, northern Poland, involving jet fighters and live firing of artillery munitions.  GEUS, an independent research and advisory institution within Denmark's Ministry of Climate, Energy and Utilities, said that it had two seismographs on Bornholm that collect data around the clock.  Bornholm, home to nearly 40,000 people, is a rocky island in the Baltic Sea, south of Sweden, northeast of Germany and north of Poland."

Well, that’s not strictly true – to be more accurate, something truly gargantuan happened in space approximately 8 billion years ago, that we are only just finding out about now. Last Friday, scientists revealed the largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed: like a supernova, but more than 10 times brighter and more powerful than any other seen before. And its cause? A giant cloud of gas being sucked into a supermassive black hole.  If you want people to be excited about something, it’s important to come up with a catchy name. So, taking a leaf out of Elon Musk’s book of baby names, scientists called it AT2021lwx. But I’m gonna call her Sue. Sue Pernova. (You’re welcome.)  Sue had humble beginnings. She started out like the damp patch in the corner of your bathroom – small and barely noticeable, then over the course of time growing into something monstrous and without precedent. It was only when scientists established just how distant Sue was (8 billion lightyears) that they realised quite how much energy she must be burning to produce a light so bright.  01:17 ‘Absolutely gargantuan’: astrophysicist explains largest cosmic explosion ever witnessed – video  This is all well and good, I hear you cry, but why should I care? Sue seems great, but she lives miles away and besides I’m far too busy having to do the weekly shop, picking up the kids from school and Googling “black mould removal”. Well, I’ve been a space superfan since I was old enough to say “Houston we have a problem”, so you don’t have to convince me to care. But space can give us an insight into our existence.  There are certain aspects of space exploration that are easy to defend. Like the Dart mission last year which successfully tested technology designed to shift an asteroid off its course, protecting Earth and its inhabitants from a fatal collision. Most of us have a vested interest in the Earth not being smashed to smithereens, so it’s great to know that Nasa is on the case.  Some of the other stuff, though, is far more abstract and, for want of a better word, nerdy. But the truth is, every time something like this happens it puts another piece in the puzzle of understanding where we came from and where we will go.  We all know some basic things about the universe and our solar system from our school days: Jupiter has its raging stormy eye, Saturn has its rings, and Pluto has an identity crisis about its latest reclassification. But what you perhaps didn’t know, because they only found out recently, is that Saturn didn’t always have its rings.  A study from the University of Colorado suggests that the rings are only 400 million years old, with Saturn being nearer 4.5 billion years in age. Those figures are quite hard to get your head around, but if you scale that timeline down, it’s the equivalent of an 85-year-old bloke called Stanley deciding to grow a mo-hawk at 81. That’s a pretty wild and late-stage development, right? Certainly not something to define his whole existence by.  In the even blinkier-blink of an eye that is the period of human existence, we happen to have magically coincided with this beautiful phenomenon. Us being here now at the same time of Saturn’s rings is a delightful coincidence: a reminder that everything is fleeting, everything is changing, even in the universe.  Someone sent me a meme recently with a picture of the galaxy and an arrow pointing to a barely visible dot labelled “You, crying in the shower”. Apart from being very funny, it’s also very true (the crying bit, certainly). I find the underlying message of it weirdly profound. We are all so very small and the universe is so very big and almost all of our hopes, dreams and fears are entirely trivial.  If that doesn’t sound particularly comforting, stick with me. In 2009, Nasa released captures from the Hubble telescope showing the deepest image of the universe ever taken to date, allowing you to scroll in and out of hundreds of galaxies and solar systems that seemingly go on for ever. If you ever need a moment of profound perspective, that does it.  Cosmically speaking, if we are all insignificant, then everything we do is almost in defiance of that. It renders the choices we make simultaneously meaningless and also the most wonderful act of living; one more beautiful addition to an already improbable existence. That’s a pretty liberating thought. It’s all connected. Like it or not, we’re all part of a kind of celestial foxtrot: expanding, contracting, dying and being reborn.  So next time you hear about something happening a million miles away, think about how you’re a small part of that and how incredible it is to exist. Why not look out of your window tonight – maybe you’ll see the light from some supernova long since gone. And who knows, perhaps someone 8 billion lightyears away will be looking back from their damp, damp, bathroom, seeing the dead light from our sun and wondering about their own place in the universe."

A Nets fan, James yearns for the days of yesteryear, when playoffs were all but irrelevant and the likes of Caris Levert and Jarrett Allen were running the show.  Philadelphia 76ers coach Doc Rivers has been on the wrong end of plenty of dominant Game 7 performances, but Jayson Tatum’s explosion on Sunday night ranks right at the top, according to the man himself.  Tatum was simply unstoppable in the series-deciding matchup, putting up a mammoth 51 points on 17-28 shooting while also grabbing 13 boards and dishing out five assists en route to a 112-88 victory. James Harden faltered – again – and so too did Joel Embiid, but Tatum was the clear difference-maker throughout the course of the game.  In the wake of the defeat, Tatum’s performance was ranked by Rivers as one of the absolute best, saying that the only game which compares was LeBron James’ Game 6 effort against his Boston Celtics in 2012.

But James had other ideas. He hit an incredible 19 of his 26 shots, ending the game with 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists to lead the Heat to victory.  11 years on, clearly Doc Rivers hasn’t forgotten that night, and it doesn’t appear likely that he’ll forget this one in a hurry either. His Game 7 record of 6-10 will be the subject of plenty of discussion over the coming days, and rightly or wrongly, will no doubt have plenty of aggrieved Sixers fans politely suggesting their team finds a new coach.  Incidentally, after LeBron James’ historic performance in 2012, the Heat went on to win Game 7 and with it the series, before beating the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win the championship. The Celtics will be hoping that Jayson Tatum’s performance leads to the same result."

But a flurry of hard hit balls and two big innings from its senior leaders allowed it to crawl back and earn the decisive victory.  The Wolverines (26-22 overall, 13-8 Big Ten) prevailed on senior day behind the power of their bats to sweep Northwestern (8-38, 3-18) by a score of 15-5.  Coming off of a Big Ten Pitcher of the Week performance against Minnesota, senior left-hander Jacob Denner looked to stay hot on the mound. But, stymied early by the Wildcats’ offense, Michigan entered an early hole, giving up two runs quickly in the first inning.  With Denner unable to replicate his dominance from a week ago in the early innings, the Wolverines needed their bats to keep them in the game — and they delivered. In the bottom of the third inning the bats unleashed, as back-to-back doubles from graduate shortstop Cody Jefferis and senior second baseman Ted Burton drove in two RBI to bring Michigan within one run.  “I like a hot Teddy,” Michigan coach Tracy Smith said. “When he’s hot, he’s fun to watch. That’s what your older guys are supposed to do, is lead by example and through their play. He’s doing an excellent job of that.”  But the best was still to come for the Wolverines.  The next inning, senior third baseman Brandon Lawrence ignited a two-out onslaught with an RBI single, followed by home runs from Jefferis and Burton — Jefferis’ first homer of the season and Burton’s third in just this series. Michigan entered the bottom of the fourth down by one, but exited up by four.  After the early blows, the Wolverines used the crucial bottom of the fourth inning to retake all momentum, only needing to close out the rest of the game — and series.  Continuing that momentum, Denner’s pitching began to smooth, allowing just two more runs in the top of the seventh before handing off to senior right-hander John Torroella with a three run Michigan lead.  “Even with the hits, (Denner) didn’t give up much solid contact,” Smith said. “Following up his unbelievable performance from last week is what we’re gonna need him to do.”  While not equal to his career best performance last weekend, Denner still kept the Wolverines in position to hold their lead.  While the lead was safe at the time of Denner’s exit, it needed insurance. And that is where Jefferis re-enters the equation.  With the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth inning, the senior roped a triple down the right field line. The hit scored all three runners, bolstering a six-run inning to close out a cycle performance at the plate for Jefferis.  “That really spread it open there,” Smith said. “Not only did it give him the cycle, but we were just saying, ‘Gosh, we need one more run just to kind of get away,’ … so the triple was big.”  He delivered the knockout shot. By piling on six runs in the seventh inning, Michigan had replicated and gone beyond what it did in its dominant fourth inning. The game was no longer in reach for Northwestern and the Wolverines achieved their lead on the backs of their seniors.  Earning the series sweep against the Wildcats is essential to Michigan’s hopes of another Big Ten Tournament run. And the final victory on Sunday shows that the Wolverines’ bats are heating up at just the right time."

The 6-foot-3 Lewis, a 2024 four-star point guard who received an Orange scholarship offer in late April, has put up several massive performances this weekend in grassroots basketball. That’s after he displayed his elite scoring prowess last month amid two NCAA live periods on the AAU circuit.  In his first two games this weekend, Lewis combined for 55 points in just 48 minutes of total action. He led his squad, the Oakland, Calif.-based Oakland Soldiers in Nike’s EYBL league, to a pair of blowout wins.  2024 Oakland Soldiers (CA) G Mikey Lewis (@MikeyLewis05): 29 PTS (5 3PTM), 5 REB, 2 AST in a win over The Family @Soldiers_Salute #EYBL Top performers ⤵️https://t.co/2gG4Pvehr5 pic.twitter.com/ANTGDWYp0Y — The Circuit (@TheCircuit) May 13, 2023  So far this spring in grassroots basketball, Lewis has proven one of the top all-around performers across all of the shoe-sponsored AAU leagues.  Syracuse basketball 2024 four-star target Mikey Lewis is a scoring machine.  This past Friday through Sunday, the EYBL is holding its third spring session at the Southwest Athletic Center in Carrollton, Texas.  According to the EYBL Web site, on Friday evening, the Oakland Soldiers defeated the Detroit-based The Family, 79-67.  In 28 minutes, Lewis tallied 29 points, five rebounds and two assists. He connected on 9-of-16 from the field, 5-of-10 from beyond the arc and 6-of-6 from the free-throw line.  On Saturday morning, the Oakland Soldiers crushed the Miami-based Nightrydas Elite by a final count of 91-70. In this victory, Lewis recorded 26 points, three boards, one assist and three steals in only 20 minutes.  He hit on 8-of-14 from the field, 5-of-8 from downtown and 5-of-5 from the charity stripe.  In late April, when the EYBL held two sessions during live periods, Lewis produced scoring outbursts of 34 points, 22 points, 22 points, 23 points and 28 points, among others.  During the first live-period session last month, at the LakePoint Champions Center in Emerson, Ga., he led the EYBL in scoring at 25.3 points per contest.  This spring, through his first 10 games on the AAU circuit, Lewis is averaging 21.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 28.1 minutes per game, while connecting on 46.1 percent from the field, 45.5 percent from 3-point land and 85.9 percent from the free-throw line. That’s impressive.  In his games on Saturday night and Sunday morning, Lewis scored 11 points and 6 points, respectively, over a combined 47 minutes. The Oakland Soldiers went 1-1 in these contests.

Astronomers recently reported the observation of what appeared to be a large gas planet being eaten up by its aging star. The team said the sun-like star had been expanding for a very long time and finally got so big that it swallowed the nearby planet.  The researchers who made the observations said the star is in our Milky Way galaxy, about 12,000 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year – about 9.5 trillion kilometers. The findings were recently reported in a study published in Nature.  Most planets are believed to meet the end of their life when the star they are orbiting runs out of energy. This process causes the star to turn into a “red giant” that grows very large. The star can then swallow up the planet, and anything else that nears it.  The scientists say the planet’s destruction happened between 10,000 and 15,000 years ago near the Aquila constellation. At that time, the star was around 10 billion years old. The team said the swallowing event created a hot explosion of light, followed by a large release of dust that shot out into space.  Kishalay De is a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He discovered the light explosion by accident in 2020. He was examining data captured by the Palomar Observatory, based near San Diego, California.  De said he was surprised to observe a star that had suddenly increased in brightness by more than 100 times over a period of 10 days. He had been searching for binary star systems. These are sets of two stars that orbit around a common center of mass. When the larger of the stars takes bites out of the other, a bright explosion called an “outburst” happens.  But De said his examinations suggested the outburst was surrounded by cold gas, meaning it could not be a binary system. He learned from another space telescope that the star had also started releasing large amounts of dust months before the outburst.  While scientists had observed past star expansions, this was the first time they have been able to observe a complete planet-swallowing event.  The researchers said the collected data showed the swallowed planet was a “gas giant” with a similar mass to the planet Jupiter. They noted that the planet had become so close to its star that it could complete a full orbit in just one day.  The planet is believed to have “engulfed” the planet over a period of around 100 days, the team said. The bright explosion happened in the final 10 days as the planet was totally destroyed.  Miguel Montarges is an astronomer at the Paris Observatory who was not involved in the research. He told the French news agency AFP the star was thousands of degrees hotter than the planet when the destruction happened. He explained, ""It's like putting an ice cube into a boiling pot.""  Astronomers say the same event is expected to happen to other planets – including Mercury, Venus and Earth. De said our sun will likely reach its red giant period in about 5 billion years.  Astronomers do not know if more planets are circling the star at a safer distance. If so, De said they may have thousands of years before also getting swallowed up.  Now that they know what to look for, the researchers will be looking for more similar events. They believe thousands of planets around other stars will likely suffer the same fate as this one did.  Morgan MacLeod is a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Massachusetts. He told Reuters news agency he finds it “humbling” to think about our own planet facing the same destruction. MacLeod noted that since Earth is much smaller, its destruction will not cause such an outburst.  “When Earth is eventually swallowed, the sun will hardly notice,"" he said.  I’m Bryan Lynn.

Most of the improvisations have saved them money and helped to keep heads above water.  However, the new way of boycotting the high cost of cooking gas cylinders may cost lives than it can save money.  Economy&Lifestyle discovered that the cost of gas cylinders has risen so high that it becomes difficult for average homes to afford and still fill them with gas.  The situation becomes worse when considering that the pump price of kerosene, which would have been an alternative, is prohibitive.  Checks show that the price of cylinders varies according to the sizes. A 3kg gas cylinder costs N14,000, 5kg-N16,000 6kg – N17,000 and 12.5kg costs N19,000. Filling the cylinders with cooking gas also costs N2,600 for 3kg, N5,200 for 6kg, N8,950 for 10.5kg and N10,650 for 12.5 kg.  This means that an average home with a worn-out 5kg will need N20,250 to buy a new one and fill it, which is hard to come by.  So, the resolve is to refurbish the old ones and still manage them. However, that is where the danger is.  Mrs. Rukayat Adesoji, a trader, said her gas cylinder got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month, but due to high cost of purchasing the cylinders, she took it to a welder who patched the legs, repainted it, and since then, she has been using it.  “My gas cylinder which was 6kg got rusted and no longer stands erect since last month. When I asked for the price, I was told it was N17, 500. I was discussing it with a friend who advised me to take it to a welder to paint it and construct a new stand. I heeded to her advice and at the end spent just N3, 000 to turn my cooking gas to a brand new.”  Apart from refurbishing cylinders, some people don’t even know when their cylinders will expire. Mrs. Mercy Opara, a hair stylist, fell in that category as she explained: “I am taking my gas cylinder to the welder to spray it for me. It just cost N1, 500. The cost of buying a new cylinder is high. I have been using my cylinder for over 7 years and I don’t even know the expiry date. I just pray God blesses me so that I can buy a new one. But this one I am managing will look neat after spraying it for another two years.”  Mr. Adekanbi Joseph, a wielder, said he paints cylinder and “To paint and rebuild a cylinder stand, I charge N4, 500. Many people come here to paint as a new cylinder is now very expensive to get.”  Explaining the danger in using refurbished cylinders, The Chief Executive Officer, FKT Cooking gas and general goods, Mr. Benjamin Hope said: “A brand new cylinder can explode if the locks are not well keyed after using and if the cylinder filled with gas was moved from one place.  “There are many reasons for the high cost of gas cylinders in Nigeria. One is the cost of importation due to the exchange rate. Another is the increased migration from the use of kerosene to cooking gas which has necessitated increased demand for gas cylinders.  “You know that in such a case there will be increased importation of cylinders.”"

The model was also seen toting around a mini backpack in a gray leather fabric and gold hardware  Pop of color: The bartender — who slammed Raquel Leviss in the explosive trailer for the season ten reunion of the hit Bravo series — donned a pair of fluorescent neon yellow, fuzzy slippers  Radiant: She donned a dazzling diamond statement ring on her hand with a stunning, long, and taupe manicure  Hands full: As she stepped out of a car, the actress had her hands full with her cell phone and a portable mug  Tense: Earlier last week, fans of Vanderpump Rules caught a sneak peek of the tense season ten three-part reunion  Drama: In the trailer, Madix called out her now-ex, Tom Sandoval, 39, and slammed his mistress for being 'diabolical, demented, and subhuman'  In the preview, Madix also called her ex and his on-again, off-again lover 'f***ing rats' and said they shouldn't expect 'anything good coming for them.'  In the episode, James Kennedy, 31 — who was previously engaged to Leviss — also called Sandoval a 'backstabbing ho' for sleeping with his ex-fiancée.  After an explosive back-and-forth, Kennedy then fired back at Sandoval and called him 'a worm with a mustache' — which fans quickly took to social media to make into memes.  The first episode of the explosive reunion is set to premiere later this month on May 24."

He also co-hosts Cash Considerations: A Chicago Bulls Podcast for the Blue Wire Network.  Boston Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla changed his starting lineup for Game 6 against the Philadelphia 76ers, inserting big man Robert Williams III and moving Derrick White to the bench. While the Celtics were on the ropes in the fourth quarter and needed both a late Jayson Tatum explosion and Sixers collapse to win, the move undoubtedly worked given Boston’s fast start to the game and Williams’ plus-18 in the box score. Because of this, it’s no surprise Mazzulla is sticking with this lineup for Sunday’s Game 7.  Mazzulla spoke to the media before the do-or-die game and confirmed he will keep the two-big starting lineup in place against Joel Embiid and Co., per ESPN’s Tim Bontemps. That means it will be Williams, Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart and Al Horford going up against Philly.  Williams played 28 minutes in Game 6, his highest playing time of the series. The big man was under 20 minutes in the prior three games and had played a high of 22 points in Game 2 before Game 6. He made his presence known with 10 points, nine rebounds and two blocks in those 28 minutes. And, again, the Celtics outscored the Sixers by 18 points when Williams was on the court.

If they can get up early and get the crowd into it, the Sixers will be in big trouble. It’s going to be a fascinating Game 7 with an Eastern Conference Finals date against the Miami Heat on the line."

The photographer, Boris Eldagsen, openly admitted that the image was AI generated and refused to accept the award, saying he had entered it to start a debate over whether an AI-generated image could in fact be a photograph.  The stunt was a response to an explosion in readily accessible AI tools. Last November’s launch of ChatGPT was, on the face of it, one of the most momentous technological advances in recent years. A text-based system, ChatGPT can write stories, college essays, job applications and so on in clear, fluent language and, if the user so chooses, in the style of Shakespeare, Donald Trump or Chaucer.  It clocked up over 100 million users in the first two months after launch, making it the fastest growing consumer application in history. And, less than four months after ChatGPT hit the headlines, OpenAI, the developer, launched GPT-4, the successor to GPT-3, the artificial intelligence system on which ChatGPT is based."
