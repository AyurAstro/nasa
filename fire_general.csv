Carencro Fire Department, with the help of fire departments from Lafayette, Scott, and Duson, were able to bring the fire under control in approximately 30 minutes.  The fire was contained to the concession stand area, causing severe damage. The bar and offices on the upper floors only received minor smoke damage.  However, the extreme heat from the fire on the first floor has compromised the structural integrity of the second floor.  Investigators from the Lafayette Fire Department determined the fire originated in a storage room and was deemed accidental. Fire fighters remained on scene for several hours putting out hotspots.  Carencro Fire Chief, David Mouton, said there were no players or spectators at the park when the fire started and no injuries were reported.  A staff member preparing the park for a softball tournament discovered the fire and attempted to put it out with a fire extinguisher, but was repelled by the intense heat and flames.

The blaze caught many residents off guard on Saturday at 4:23 p.m.  “We almost ignored it,” resident Jessica Hennie said. “We were like, it’s probably just another false alarm. And we were about to just sit there and ignore it again.”  Many residents evacuated the building as the Parma Fire Department worked to extinguish the flames using a ladder tip technique. No injuries have been reported, but some residents are worried that it could have been much worse because the fire alarm system goes off frequently.  “Sometimes you have a lot of kids in here and they don’t have any play area in here for them, so they do things like pull the alarm,” 17-year resident Audray Johnson said.  She’s happy that everyone got out safe, but now is concerned about any potential delayed effects from the fire.  WJW photo  WJW photo  Photo courtesy Parma Fire  Photo courtesy Parma Fire Department  “The ventilation system, and also the smoke and water damage, because we’re above it,” Johnson said. “The fire was above us, and it might come down in the walls.”  The Regency’s management office was closed on Sunday and our request for comment was not made by the time this report was published, But PFD’s public information officer said only one resident ended up being displaced.  “The only people displaced from the fire right now are the actual residents in the affected apartment,” Robert Bures said. “From what we’ve been told everyone else has moved back into their units.”  One resident was packing up to move out after the fire. She declined speaking on camera but said she’s seen enough and is actively breaking her lease due to the conditions and safety concerns compared to the price of her unit.  Other residents are happy no one was injured, and hope management follows up to make sure they are safe.  “Make sure the fire alarms and fire detectors are checked, make sure in case a real fire happens everyone gets out safe, and the elevators work,” Heather Dobson said. “But other than that I think it’s a good place to live.”  PFD said it should know more about what caused the blaze by Friday, once their investigation is complete. It is also grateful to the Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights Fire Departments for assistance covering ambulance calls while the fire was being controlled."

She said what her family is going through is so hard and they need help.  “Clothes, shoes, food, like I said in the beginning they need everything. They lost everything tragically. Everything due to a hot water heater,” Toronto said.  Toronto said she’s still in shock and knows it will take some time to adjust to their new reality, but she is hopeful things will be okay. She said it’s really sad it happened on Mother’s Day but she is extremely grateful for her neighbors who have been helping her.  “I’ll be alright though but it’s going to take me a while to get used to it,” Toronto said. “We got to just find another place.

The Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies were called to reports of a fully involved structure fire at 22 Main St. in South Glens Falls at 4:34 a.m.  Around noon on Sunday, one tanker truck from the South Glens Falls Fire Co. and state fire investigators were still on scene as an excavator was used to clean up what little was left of the commercial building.  The vacant building was for many years the site of a McDonald’s restaurant and more recently had been a Chinese restaurant, the news release said.  The fire spread to the south side neighboring building, which houses Glens Falls Candy Co. and Wash and Wear Laundry. It was visibly damaged and will be closed until further notice.  Traffic was being controlled at both ends of the block where the blaze took place. Crews were working to clean charred debris back from the sidewalk and also made sure no hot-spots were left to reignite.  The sheriff’s office said there were no injuries reported. The buildings were not occupied when the fire broke out.  As of late Sunday afternoon, no additional information on the fire was available, including whether investigators had determined a cause. Saratoga County and New York State fire investigators were called to the scene  The restaurant building was listed for sale on the LoopNet commercial real estate website for $650,000. The 4,500-square-foot structure, which also had a 48-space parking lot, was originally built in 1978.  In 2005, McDonald’s vacated the building to move to a new site near the corner of Main Street and Saratoga Avenue. After remaining vacant for two years, Ray Chen purchased the building for $475,000 in 2007 to be the home of a new location of his upstate New York Chinese Buffet restaurant business.  Saratoga County real estate records show the property is currently owned by Xiaomei Wang of Saratoga Springs."
