Police said several 911 calls were made around 8:49 p.m. and Fire Marshal William “Bill” Davin was already on scene when officers arrived.  Officers believe an accelerant was added to a burn pit, causing the fire to burn out of control in the yard, according to the report. Police said Monroe firefighters quickly extinguished the fire, preventing property damage.  The homeowner, a 27-year-old Monroe man had a campfire permit, but was issued a warning for a burn permit violation from the fire marshal, and he will not be allowed to obtain burn permits in the near future, police said.  On Monday, Davin told The Sun he is conducting an open investigation into what accelerant was used to cause the explosion and make the fire burn out of control.

(WCIA) – What started as a final hurrah for newly graduated U of I students could follow some of them to court.  “There was one couch put in the middle of the street. Then all of a sudden there [were] 20 couches and it was kind-of the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” U of I senior Jared Kurland said.  Then, that pile of furniture was set on fire as hundreds of people watched. Students say the crowd started gathering just before midnight. By 12:15, the fire ignited at the intersection of S Oak and E Chalmers Streets in Champaign. By 1 a.m. Monday, multiple citations for open alcohol violations were issued.  “I mean, I probably inhaled half a couch just being in the vicinity because everything was going up in the air,” U of I senior Spencer Gallagher said.  That’s a sentence you don’t hear every day.  “Someone wanted to start a fire and that’s exactly what happened,” Kurland said.  300 people crowded around a residential intersection – some with alcohol, old furniture and lighter fluid in hand.  “It was terrifying. We were all texting each other being like, ‘does everybody have renters’ insurance?'” U of I senior Regan Sauer said.  That’s because it happened just a few feet from Sauer’s front lawn, in a pocket of Campustown known as “Seniorland.”  “We’ve had people over before but it’s never been this severe,” Sauer said. “We’re kind-of upset that this happened.”  And no one really knows why, except that it may have been part of a farewell tradition among new graduates.  “It’s kind-of the last thing all the seniors do. Then after this we all walked to the quad, have a good time there, and say our goodbyes to each other,” U of I senior Sahil Yemul said.  “There was a similar instance of this last year, though maybe not quite as large,” University of Illinois Police Department Communications Director Patrick Wade said in a statement.  “It wasn’t a good thing. I mean, it was cool to watch at least,” Gallagher said.  UIPD says the gathering is currently under investigation and could bring serious legal consequences. So far, six students have been given notices to appear in court.  “Luckily I didn’t get one but I was here when they were passing them out,” Kurland said.  Plus, they’re all feeling lucky no one was hurt. Students said it was a way to spend their last moments in Champaign together…  “It was probably not the safest thing to do but you can’t really do this anywhere else so everyone was just having a good time,” Yemul said.  …And simply, to dispose of items they don’t need anymore.  “There are all these old couches that people have and they want to get rid of them somehow. So they just brought them out there and set them on fire,” Kurland said.  It was eventually extinguished by the fire department, and Champaign Public Works crews cleared the road of debris. But that didn’t stop the house on that corner from receiving a notice for excessive trash, and partial responsibility for a mess created largely by strangers.  “That’s why we’re out here now trying to pick it up because we obviously don’t want to get in trouble with the city. We’re not troublemaker girls we just want to be on everybody’s good side,” Sauer said.  UIPD declined an interview because the investigation is ongoing. You can read their full statement below."

The blaze occurred in the kitchen area of The Thai on North Mission Street just before 1 a.m.  Wenatchee Police Department Capt. Edgar Reinfeld says officers had to rescue both men as the fire raged, including the need to physically carry one of them from the building.  ""Officers arrived and immediately found one male just inside the building. Then, they discovered there was a second man in the structure and got them both out safely. Through an investigation it was learned that these two were cooking inside the restaurant after hours and that both were intoxicated while doing so.""  Police say the restaurant's owners told officers the pair were not authorized to be inside the restaurant, which was closed at the time of the fire.  Reinfeld says the employee's actions caused the fire but its exact source is still under investigation and that charges against the men are unlikely, but possible.  ""Most fire-related charges such as Reckless Burning or Arson - and in this case it would be considered a potential arson because it was an occupied building even though it was just the two of them inside the building - require an element of recklessness at the least, like someone saying 'this is a really bad idea but let's do it anyway', or the intent to actually cause a structure fire. And I'm not sure we're going to get to either one of those based on the evidence that we currently have on the fire, but if something else were to come to light, we would possibly file charges.""  No one was injured in the fire but the restaurant has been rendered unable to operate as a result of the fire and will be closed indefinitely while necessary repairs are made.  KPQ News has reached out to the owners of The Thai but had yet to receive a response at the time of this posting."

All residents within the impacted area have been updated on the change in evacuation status. Earlier, on Sunday, fire managers downgraded the Sandy Wildfire Evacuation Plan to Phase One of three phases.  The fre, which started May 1, was reported at 19,814 acres and 52% contained by Monday night.  Riki Hoopes, U.S. National Parks wildfire information officer, said some precipitation was observed over the fire area on Monday and that crews were expected to continue to hold and improve the perimeter of the fire over the next several days.  Ground and aviation resources were also continuing to use suppression burn-out operations to clean up unburned pockets of fuel within the fire perimeter to decrease the risk of fire spotting over the control lines.  Anatomy of a wildfire:  Hoopes said that beginning on Tuesday and due to the decrease in complexity, the fire will be managed by a local Type 4 Incident Management Team. Type 4 teams are operated on a city, county, or fire district level.  Closures remain in effect west of 11 Mile Road, north of US41, east of Monument Trail, and south of Mud Lake, Little Deer, Oasis Trail and Lost Dog, including the Florida Trail from Oasis Visitor Center to I75 (MM63).  Visitors may continue to see smoke from the roadways and the risk of smoke continues to remain the biggest concern. Travelers should use caution throughout the impacted area.

The blaze caught many residents off guard on Saturday at 4:23 p.m.  “We almost ignored it,” resident Jessica Hennie said. “We were like, it’s probably just another false alarm. And we were about to just sit there and ignore it again.”  Many residents evacuated the building as the Parma Fire Department worked to extinguish the flames using a ladder tip technique. No injuries have been reported, but some residents are worried that it could have been much worse because the fire alarm system goes off frequently.  “Sometimes you have a lot of kids in here and they don’t have any play area in here for them, so they do things like pull the alarm,” 17-year resident Audray Johnson said.  She’s happy that everyone got out safe, but now is concerned about any potential delayed effects from the fire.  WJW photo  WJW photo  Photo courtesy Parma Fire  Photo courtesy Parma Fire Department  “The ventilation system, and also the smoke and water damage, because we’re above it,” Johnson said. “The fire was above us, and it might come down in the walls.”  The Regency’s management office was closed on Sunday and our request for comment was not made by the time this report was published, But PFD’s public information officer said only one resident ended up being displaced.  “The only people displaced from the fire right now are the actual residents in the affected apartment,” Robert Bures said. “From what we’ve been told everyone else has moved back into their units.”  One resident was packing up to move out after the fire. She declined speaking on camera but said she’s seen enough and is actively breaking her lease due to the conditions and safety concerns compared to the price of her unit.  Other residents are happy no one was injured, and hope management follows up to make sure they are safe.  “Make sure the fire alarms and fire detectors are checked, make sure in case a real fire happens everyone gets out safe, and the elevators work,” Heather Dobson said. “But other than that I think it’s a good place to live.”  PFD said it should know more about what caused the blaze by Friday, once their investigation is complete. It is also grateful to the Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights Fire Departments for assistance covering ambulance calls while the fire was being controlled."

The Saratoga County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that deputies were called to reports of a fully involved structure fire at 22 Main St. in South Glens Falls at 4:34 a.m.  Around noon on Sunday, one tanker truck from the South Glens Falls Fire Co. and state fire investigators were still on scene as an excavator was used to clean up what little was left of the commercial building.  The vacant building was for many years the site of a McDonald’s restaurant and more recently had been a Chinese restaurant, the news release said.  The fire spread to the south side neighboring building, which houses Glens Falls Candy Co. and Wash and Wear Laundry. It was visibly damaged and will be closed until further notice.  Traffic was being controlled at both ends of the block where the blaze took place. Crews were working to clean charred debris back from the sidewalk and also made sure no hot-spots were left to reignite.  The sheriff’s office said there were no injuries reported. The buildings were not occupied when the fire broke out.  As of late Sunday afternoon, no additional information on the fire was available, including whether investigators had determined a cause. Saratoga County and New York State fire investigators were called to the scene  The restaurant building was listed for sale on the LoopNet commercial real estate website for $650,000. The 4,500-square-foot structure, which also had a 48-space parking lot, was originally built in 1978.  In 2005, McDonald’s vacated the building to move to a new site near the corner of Main Street and Saratoga Avenue. After remaining vacant for two years, Ray Chen purchased the building for $475,000 in 2007 to be the home of a new location of his upstate New York Chinese Buffet restaurant business.  Saratoga County real estate records show the property is currently owned by Xiaomei Wang of Saratoga Springs."
