With the win, the Hogs secured their seventh SEC series victory of the season and improved to 30-4 at home this year.  Hollan struck out a career-high 10 batters, limiting the Gamecocks to just one run on five hits and one walk. The left-hander threw a season-high 113 pitches in his nine-inning complete game and recorded 19 consecutive outs until a two-out single in the top half of the ninth inning.  The performance marks the Razorbacks’ first complete game of at least nine innings against an SEC team since Dominic Taccolini’s 10-inning complete game shutout against Kentucky in 2016. Hollan is the second Arkansas pitcher to throw a complete game this season after Will McEntire twirled a nine-inning complete game against Louisiana Tech on April 11.  South Carolina’s lone run of the game came via a leadoff home run in the top of the third. Hollan was untouchable from that point forward, however, allowing the Arkansas offense to hit its groove and take control of the ballgame.  John Bolton’s one-out RBI double to right center in the bottom half of the third tied things at one apiece before Parker Rowland’s go-ahead two-run single to center in the fifth. Rowland’s clutch piece of hitting put the Hogs ahead, 3-1.  Arkansas tacked on two more runs with a two-out RBI single by Caleb Cali in the sixth followed by a two-out solo home run by Ben McLaughlin in the eighth, extending the lead to 5-1. Cali and Peyton Holt both finished with a team-leading three hits, and Rowland collected the Razorbacks’ lone multi-RBI performance of the game.  The Hogs’ four-run lead was more than enough for Hollan to protect as he finished off his complete game with a scoreless ninth inning, securing the Razorbacks’ series-clinching win and put the Hogs in the driver’s seat of the SEC.  Arkansas now owns a one-and-a-half-game lead over LSU in the SEC Western Division and a one-game lead over Florida in the overall SEC standings with three games left to play in the regular season.  Up next, the Hogs will travel to Nashville, Tenn., to close out the regular season at Vanderbilt. First pitch between the Razorbacks and Commodores is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday, May 18, on SEC Network.

Despite entering each of the past four seasons with championship expectations, he has managed to lose in the second round four years in a row. His teams led three of the four series after five games, and his team had the higher seed in two of those collapses. Sunday was perhaps the worst of them all. Despite leading for most of the first half, the 76ers fell apart against the Boston Celtics, Rivers' former team, in a 33-10 third-quarter debacle. That gave Rivers his NBA record 10th Game 7 loss. No other head coach has more than five Game 7 losses.  As such, questions have immediately arisen surrounding Rivers' job security. While he initially signed a five-year deal to take over the 76ers in 2020, each playoff defeat has been more devastating than the last and the 76ers will now have to consider whether or not they want to give Rivers the chance to lead them for a fourth season. Rivers addressed the rumors at his post-game press conference Sunday, and while he wouldn't deny the inherent insecurity of his profession, he did suggest that he plans to be back next season. ""Yeah. I think I got two years left,"" Rivers said. ""No one is safe in our business and I get that.""  Rivers isn't the only notable 76er whose future is in question. James Harden can be a free agent after re-signing in Philadelphia on a one-year deal with a player option for a second. Rumors have linked him to his old team, the Houston Rockets, all season. He claimed that he has not thought about free agency yet, but that he thinks his current team still has room to grow. ""It's only Year 1 for us together,"" Harden said.  Looming over every decision Philadelphia makes this offseason is Joel Embiid's future. While the MVP winner is under contract for at least three more seasons, superstars are rarely satisfied with humiliating playoff defeats on a seemingly annual basis. All it will take to upend this franchise is one trade request. Embiid has given no indication yet that he plans to leave Philadelphia, but NBA history tells us that he won't be satisfied with second-round exits forever. Embiid did comment on Rivers' future in Philly after Game 7, saying the coach has done a ""fantastic job.""  That is going to inform whatever the 76ers do with Rivers, Harden and the rest of their team this offseason. The clock was already ticking. After what happened on Sunday, Philadelphia will have to make major moves to keep their best player happy. The logical place to start that process would be with a new coach."

He was 0 for 2 from the field after intermission in the Sixers’ Round 2, Game 6 defeat to the Heat.  On Sunday afternoon at TD Garden, he scored three second-half points. The Celtics then immediately piled up 18 in a row as the Sixers crumbled on their way to another second-round playoff exit, losing Game 7 in a blowout.  Harden had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting, seven assists, six rebounds and five turnovers. Across the Sixers’ four losses in the series, he made a mere 12 of 55 field goals (21.8 percent). While Harden was brilliant in Games 1 and 4 and very solid in Game 5, he and the Sixers were not nearly good enough with the season at stake.  Head coach Doc Rivers gave a generous spin on the 10-time All-Star’s outing.  “I thought James came to play,” Rivers said. “I really did. I thought he was trying to see the game. I thought he played downhill a lot. Where he passed the ball was the right decisions tonight, and we didn’t get anything out of it. I get it. James, (Joel Embiid), me ... I know we’ve got to point somewhere, right? But I thought James, in particular, he was trying to do the right things tonight. I really did.”  Harden, who will turn 34 years old in August, missed 24 games this season, including four in March with left Achilles soreness that he said had been bothering him “for some months.” When healthy, he regularly created excellent shots for everyone around him with inch-perfect hit-ahead feeds, smooth pick-and-roll passes, and well-timed kick-outs. After starting 12-12, the Sixers went an NBA-best 42-16 and were second in offensive rating. Harden led the league in assists for a second time with 10.7 per game.  For next season, he has a player option of $35.6 million.  “James has a decision to make this summer, and he’ll make it,” Rivers said. “I think he overall enjoyed being here. It’s tough for him. We asked him to play a little differently than he’s always been accustomed to. I think it made us a better team. And unfortunately, I thought for James at times, it wasn’t always best for him. But he still did it. You appreciate that as a coach.”  Speaking minutes later in the visiting locker room, Harden didn’t provide much to supplement his coach’s comments on that subject.  “I haven’t even thought about it,” he said of his player option.  What is he looking for next?  “I just want to have a chance to compete,” Harden said. “Compete.”  Harden also offered little when asked about Rivers, whom he’d called “one of the best coaches to ever coach the game of basketball” at his introductory Sixers press conference last February.  “Our relationship is OK,” he said.  Harden did agree with the notion that he and Embiid can further grow their partnership.  “Definitely,” he said. “I feel like we had a pretty solid team. Obviously, you always look to get better, whether it’s the personnel you have now or adding pieces. We’ll see how it goes.”  By next postseason, Embiid will be 30 years old.  “We’ve got an unfinished job,” the MVP big man said. “We haven’t won anything, and I think we’ve got a chance to win. Obviously, going to seven games and having a chance to close it out at home, which we didn’t do. I still believe we’ve got the chance to win. We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I know (Harden) has a player option or they can extend him, but that’s on those guys to figure it out. I’m going to stay out of it, but I still believe that me and him, we’ve got the chance to win.  “It’s going to take more than us. We’ve all got to look at ourselves. I’ve got to be better and I will be better. That’s what I’m focused on. All of us, we’ve got to come back and find ways to just keep improving and help the team. You can’t win alone. I can’t win alone. Me and James, we just can’t win alone. That’s why basketball, it’s played 5-on-5. We just need everybody to keep trying to find ways to get better, and we’ll be fine.”"

Paul DeJong added a solo shot and Arenado drove in four runs for the Cardinals, who won for the sixth time in seven games since an eight-game losing streak. Their previous two wins came on ninth-inning rallies against closer Kenley Jansen at Fenway Park.  Lars Nootbaar had three hits and scored three times for St. Louis, and Paul Goldschmidt added two hits and an RBI. Miles Mikolas (2-1) pitched six innings of one-run ball, allowing four hits with two walks.  “We are a playoff team despite our bad start,” Mikolas said. “The talent is there. We're a very good baseball team.”  Rafael Devers had an RBI single for Boston, which lost for the fifth time in six games.  It was the first series sweep this season for St. Louis (16-25), which owns the NL’s worst record. Arenado homered over the Green Monster once in each game of the series.  The Cardinals finished a six-game road trip to Wrigley Field and Fenway Park at 5-1.  “It's a good road trip,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “To get back on track and the way we've done it, against two good teams, to be able to go out there with the style of play that has been really good. I know I've said it several times, but that clubhouse has trust in one another.”  Red Sox starter Corey Kluber (2-5) gave up four runs and seven hits — two homers — in five innings. He walked three and struck out five.  “I put us in a hole early,” he said. “I think it just boils down to poor fastball command.”  DeJong’s shot into the center-field seats broke a 1-all tie in the second. Knizner’s drive came in the fourth, also going out to center.  Boston’s Enmanuel Valdez had a two-run homer overturned by review in the seventh on a drive that replays showed hooked foul just short of Pesky's Pole.  Génesis Cabrera escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, getting Masataka Yoshida to fly out to end the inning.  “Played two good games and we lost in the ninth and today they kicked our butt,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.  DAD KNOWS  Standing on the field about two hours before the game, Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale asked how the Boston Celtics were doing in Game 7 of their NBA playoff series against Philadelphia. When informed All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had 25 points at halftime, the lefty said: “He’s my oldest son’s favorite athlete. He says it’s me, but I think that’s just to make me feel good. He has two of his jerseys and only one of mine.”  BACK INTO IT  Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras was stretching and squatting with a catcher’s mitt in the clubhouse before the game. After a break from catching, Contreras is slated to be back behind the plate Monday against Milwaukee. He was moved to DH on May 5.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Cardinals: OF Dylan Carlson left the game with a sprained left ankle.  Red Sox: INF Trevor Story (elbow surgery) is working out at the team’s complex in Florida.

After the Sixers were eliminated in Game 7 of the 2021 NBA Playoffs as a No. 1 seed to the No. 5 Atlanta Hawks, a game in which Simmons infamously passed up a wide-open dunk, he eventually requested a trade in the offseason. He did not play to start the 2022 regular season, citing not being ready mentally, then was traded to Brooklyn in a deal that landed Philadelphia James Harden at the deadline.  But the post-Simmons era has not yielded fruit for Harden, Joel Embiid and Co. either, as they've been bounced in the second round for consecutive seasons.  Simmons played 42 games for the Nets this season and averaged 6.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.3 steals in 26.3 minutes per game."

Drury, the sixth seed in the tournament, ends the year with a 30-24 record. Quincy will go to the NCAA-II Tournament with an automatic berth at 44-9.  The Hawks started the game with three runs in the top of first and opened up the lead by posting six runs in the third inning.  Drury got on the board with two runs in the fifth, scoring on a Carson Shaver RBI double, then on a sacrifice fly from Tyler Bastunas.  Quincy, the top scoring offense in the GLVC that averaged more than nine runs per game, kept scoring and added two more in the sixth as well as a single run in the seventh and eighth to lead 13-2.  The Panthers put up four runs in the eighth, highlighted by Shaver’s bases-clearing double that drove in three, but the deficit was too much.  “If you want to beat Quincy, you have to out-pitch them and out-hit them and we weren’t able to do either of those things today,” said Drury head coach Scott Nasby. “We had a long night but a great night last night, but unfortunately, we weren’t able to carry that over to today.”  Jay Hammel (6-2) got the win for the Hawks while Drury starter Cade Waits (5-6) took the loss.  Shaver finished the game going 2 for 4 with two doubles and 4 RBI’s. Graydon Miller went 2 for 3 with two runs and a double.  Hawks DH Austin Simpson went 4 for 5 with 5 RBI’s and he hit his 17th home run of the year.  Drury entered the GLVC Tournament on a seven-game losing streak and was one out away from a loss in Thursday’s opening round as they trailed Maryville 3-1 when Brooks Sunny’s two-RBI single tied the game. The Panthers beat the Saints in 11 innings 6-3, then picked up a 12-4 win over William Jewell on Friday.  Drury had a late start to their game on Saturday as the first pitch was not until 9:40 pm, and in a game that lasted until 1:08 am on Sunday, the Panthers downed Indianapolis 11-4 avenging a loss earlier in the season to UIndy starter Brady Ware, who no-hit Drury while hitting for the cycle at the plate in the same game on April 7.  “I thought we brought some great energy into the tournament,” said Nasby. “We had some great performances offensively and on the mound and had a lot of positivity through the weekend.  “It was good to see some people step up like Graydon Miller, who hadn’t really played at all this year, but came through with some big hits when we needed them this weekend. Brooks Sunny continued to be a clutch player like he was all season, and it was good to see a senior, Carson Shaver, go out playing as well as he did today.”  Sunday’s championship marks the sixth time in program history the Panthers have reached the GLVC title game."

TORONTO -- — Danny Jansen hit a two-run single in the ninth inning and the Toronto Blue Jays rallied to beat the Atlanta Braves 6-5 on Sunday to complete a three-game sweep.  George Springer hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays, who are 12-3 at home this season.  “This team’s resilient,” Jansen said. “We’re looking to win every game, and we believe that we can with the bats and the staff we have.”  With Toronto trailing 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero thought he tied the game to begin the ninth, pumping his fist as he watched his deep drive to right, but Guerrero was held to a single when the ball hit the wall.  The Blue Jays loaded the bases with two outs before Jansen singled to left field off Raisel Iglesias (1-1), driving in Guerrero and Matt Chapman.  “We had an opportunity to win the game and we couldn’t close the deal,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “It’s frustrating, but this game is frustrating.”  The Braves have lost four straight and five of eight.  “Tough one to swallow,” Atlanta’s Austin Riley said.  Nate Pearson (1-0) worked one inning for the win.  Ozzie Albies hit a two-run home run, and Ronald Acuña Jr. and Kevin Pillar each added solo blasts for Atlanta, which has lost nine straight against Toronto.  “Winning against a team like that three games in a row is really hard,” Blue Jays manager John Schneider said.  The Braves made three errors and the Blue Jays had two defensive miscues, both by Gold Glove third baseman Chapman. Toronto pitchers also made a pair of wild pitches.  Snitker said he didn’t realize how windy it was on the field with the roof at Rogers Centre open until he came out to replace right-hander Collin McHugh in the second.  Pillar, who played with Toronto from 2013 until 2019, agreed that the conditions were “difficult” Sunday.  “You don’t feel a lot of the wind at ground level, it’s kind of up higher when those balls get up there,” Pillar said. “The ball was moving all over the place.”  Acuña homered on left-hander Yusei Kikuchi’s third pitch of the game, the 28th leadoff homer of his career, and Michael Harris II made it 2-0 with an RBI single in the second.  Toronto responded with three runs in the bottom of the second. Brandon Belt hit an RBI single and Guerrero’s base hit drove in a pair of runs.  Albies connected in the third, his 10th homer of the season.  Pillar made it 5-3 in the fourth when he homered against his former team, his fourth of the season, but Springer cut the Blue Jays’ deficit to one when he answered in the bottom half with a solo drive to left, his fifth.  McHugh made his first start of the season for Atlanta. He gave up three runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings.  Kikuchi allowed five runs, four earned, and nine hits in 4-plus innings.  WELCOME BACK  Pillar got a standing ovation before he batted in the second, his first at bat of the series and first appearance in Toronto since April 24, 2019, with San Francisco.  “It’s definitely really special to come back that many years later and to be remembered and to be appreciated,” Pillar said. “It was overwhelming.”  TABLE SETTER  Acuña reached base four times and scored twice. He leads the NL in hits (54), total bases (90), runs scored (36), stolen bases (17).  UP NEXT  Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (4-3, 3.32) starts Monday when Atlanta begins a three-game series at Texas. The Rangers have not named a starter.  Blue Jays: RHP Alek Manoah (1-3, 4.83) starts Monday when Toronto hosts the New York Yankees for a four-game series. New York has not named a starter.  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports"

(WTVM) - Northside Christian Church hosted an adaptive needs sports game this weekend.  Mother’s Day was on the minds of many adaptive sports participants at this month’s adaptive sports game that was held on Saturday.  Volleyball was the game of choice for the month.  The church has been hosting sports games for kids, and older people with disabilities and challenges, to give them a chance to learn a sport and play among their peers.  Participants were also able to create a special gift of flowers for the mom in their life.  As the program wraps up for the Spring, volunteers say they need more people to come out and help with their upcoming summer camp.  “Just like we do here, we assign every child a buddy. The buddy just hangs out with them during the course of the event, so they can direct them, like we may be coming back for snack, or they may need help with a skill, and things like that so that’s really what we need volunteers for,” says Volunteer Buddy Coordinator Vikki Hutchinson.  The adaptive program’s summer camp starts June 7 and ends June 9, and volunteers are needed to help kids that are on a waitlist. If you want to participate, contact the church at (706) 324-5220.

""We’re going to bring it home all the way this year.”  “It was an electric environment,"" said Patriots player Julian Edelman. ""There’s a Boston vs. Philly thing that we’ve had the last decade.""  The Celtics won with 24 points ahead of the 76ers by the end of the game, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals to go against the Miami Heat.

The 3rd overall pick of the 2017 Draft broke a league record on Sunday for the most points in a Game 7 match.  “I thought he was hot as fish grease but nah I said he’s hot as whale grease. Because that dude was cooking,"" said a Cedric Maxwell, retired Celtic and radio broadcaster.  Philly's best hardly showed up, and former Celtics Head Coach Doc Rivers now has the most Game 7 losses of any coach in league history.  “[I] Was expecting a bounce back game from Harden after a brutal Game 5 and 6, but just did not get it,"" said a 76ers fan at the Garden.  The Celtics are up against the 76ers tomorrow (Sunday) at TD Garden for Game 7, and the city of Boston is behind them.  Philly didn't show up in part because of how Boston's fans did after Jaylen Brown called them out following Game 6.  ""Y'all love to call us out,"" said Brown. ""I'm calling you guys out this time. The energy in the garden has been okay at best all [of] playoffs.""  After Sunday's victory, Brown said this: ""Way to respond. The energy in the building was through the roof, it was amazing.""  “Jaylen was right!"" said actor Donnie Wahlberg. ""Watch our interview from a week ago. I said the same thing. It hasn’t quite been the energy level! Tonight they answered the call. Jaylen was right to call everyone out.”  Brandy Cole chats with Latoyia Edwards ahead of Mother's Day, when her son, Jayson Tatum, and the Celtics will play in Game 7 against the 76ers.  Celtics fans answered the call, some even cancelling plans to see them play.  ""We had an anniversary dinner planned for this week, but we decided the money was better spent on Game 7 tickets, said Brittany Hopkins.  “Wow. It was the best way to spend a five year anniversary,"" said Hopkin's boyfriend Sam Coveny.  Fans outside of TD Garden said Tatum's role in the Game 7 victory solidified his Celtics legacy.  ""He’s stamped,"" said Celtics fan Benjamin Tranfaglia. ""He’s solidified. He needs to bring that ring home. But after that performance and a few others? He’s stamped."""
