WASHINGTON -- — Joey Meneses drove in four runs as part of a four-hit day, CJ Abrams homered and the Washington Nationals defeated the New York Mets 10-3 on Monday to split a four-game series.  New York has lost nine of its last 13 and dropped 15 of 21 since its 14-7 start. The Mets are 0-5-2 in their last seven series and have not won consecutive games since taking three in a row from April 19-21. Big-spending New York fell to fourth in the NL East, 1 1/2 games ahead of last-place Washington.  “A lot of times you know what the problem is and you’re just trying to figure out ways to fix it,” Mets center fielder Brandon Nimmo said. “That’s what makes this sport difficult. I don’t really know. There’s probably a number of things you can point at.”  Patrick Corbin (2-5) earned his first home victory since last Aug. 28, surrendering two runs and eight hits over six innings.  The rebuilding Nationals, who scored in each inning they batted except the second, improved to 17-17 since losing five of their first six games.  “Let’s forget about the first week of the season,"" Washington manager Dave Martinez said. ""We’ve been playing really well. I want them to take that into consideration. Not just playing one team, but understanding where we’re at and what we’re doing. It’s been fun. They’re playing with a lot of energy. They come to the ballpark ready. They’re engaged. They’re going out there and they’re doing the simple things right.”  Meneses doubled in Lane Thomas with one out in the first to put New York in another early hole. The Mets have been outscored 37-9 in the first inning this season.  Meneses added another RBI double in the third off New York starter David Peterson (1-6). Keibert Ruiz followed with a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.  The Nationals scored two more runs in the fourth and another in the fifth against Peterson, who allowed six runs and nine hits in five innings. Peterson has yielded at least four runs in six consecutive starts, and his ERA ballooned to a season-high 8.08.  “He knows he's capable of pitching well up here and he feels good physically,” manager Buck Showalter said. “That's what's been really frustrating for everybody. Some of the breaking balls have been inconsistent. I thought he had a little better one today, but he just never could get any footing where they had to guard against something.”  Abrams hit a solo shot off Tommy Hunter in the sixth. It was the second day in a row Abrams went deep, and three of his four homers this season have come against the Mets.  Meneses added a run-scoring infield single later in the inning and an RBI double in the eighth. He is hitting .452 (19 of 42) with 20 RBI with runners in scoring position.  The Mets managed three hits in two different innings against Corbin, but pushed across just one run in both of them — Jeff McNeil's RBI single in the second and Tommy Pham's sacrifice fly in the sixth.  New York has not homered since Pete Alonso's second-inning homer Wednesday at Cincinnati, a span of 52 innings. The Mets had two doubles among their 11 hits Monday, while seven of Washington's 15 hits went for extra bases.  “We know what we’re doing right now is not producing wins, but we also know this team is very capable of that,” Nimmo said. “Look to what you’ve done in the past, look at things that have helped in the past and be open to new information on how we can get better. Then when you get up to the plate, it’s compete time. It’s time to grind it out.”  TRAINER'S ROOM  Mets: Showalter said RHP Carlos Carrasco (elbow inflammation) could return from the injured list Friday or Saturday if his between-starts work day goes well. Carrasco pitched four shutout innings Sunday in a rehabilitation start for Double-A Binghamton.  Nationals: Washington activated OF Corey Dickerson (left calf strain) from the injured list and optioned INF/OF Jake Alu to Triple-A Rochester. Dickerson had been on the IL since April 2.  UP NEXT  Mets: RHP Justin Verlander (1-1, 2.25 ERA) makes his first home start at Citi Field on Tuesday as New York begins a three-game series against majors-best Tampa Bay.  Nationals: RHP Josiah Gray (3-5, 2.96) starts Tuesday in the opener of a three-game series at Miami.  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports"

DENVER -- — Rookie Brenton Doyle had first first multihomer game and Harold Castro had a tiebreaking, two-run double with two outs in the seventh inning that lifted Colorado over the Cincinnati Reds 9-8 Monday night for the Rockies’ 10th win in 14 games.  With the score 6-6, Ryan McMahon singled off Ben Lively (1-1) leading off the seventh. Luke Sims, who hadn't allowed a run in 11 appearances this season, relieved with one out and walked Randal Grichuk with two outs.  Castro doubled off the base of the right-field wall, giving him three hits and three RBI, and putting the Rockies ahead 8-6.  “He gets hits,"" Rockies manager Bud Black said. ""He’s a little bit of a slasher, a little bit of a low on-base compared to the batting average. There’s not a big gap between average and on-base, but the guy puts the bat on the ball. He’s a steady performer in a lot of ways. It was a good night for him.”  Wil Myers' sacrifice fly in the eighth cut the gap, and Doyle homered off Buck Farmer in the bottom half. Doyle, a 25-year-old who debuted on April 24, has four homers in 17 games. He went deep Sunday on his birthday in a 4-0 win over Philadelphia.  “With your mindset, there’s a huge shift,"" Doyle said. ""You gain so much momentum and confidence. You go up there looking at the damage and you know you can do damage because you’ve been swinging the bat well.”  Nick Senzel hit an RBI single in the ninth against Pierce Johnson, who with two on retired Henry Ramos on a game-ending flyout for his seventh save in seven chances.  Daniel Bard (1-0) pitched around a walk in the seventh, getting help when Doyle sprinted in from center to make a diving catch on Spencer Steer leading off. Steer had three hits.  Mike Moustakas also homered for Colorado. The Rockies are 9-4 in May, the second-best win percentage in the major leagues this month behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.  Cincinnati, which trailed 4-1 and 6-4, is 22-44 at Coors Field since 2002.  Reds starter Hunter Greene gave up six runs and nine hits in four innings with eight strikeouts. He had allowed four home runs in his first eight starts.  Greene averaged 98.2 mph with his fastball, down 0.6 mph from his season average, and reached 100 mph just once.  “I pitched really well tonight,"" Greene said. ""There were pitches that I doubled up on that I shouldn’t have. Those double-ups weren’t as good as the prior pitch.”  Colorado's Connor Seabold gave up six runs — four earned — eight hits and three walks in 4 1/3 innings.  TRAINER’S ROOM  Rockies: RHP Nick Mears (left oblique strain) was placed on the 15-day injured list. Colorado selected the contract of LHP Fernando Abad from Triple-A Albuquerque.  Reds: 1B Joey Votto (left biceps, left rotator cuff surgeries) was transferred to the 60-day injured list. … OF TJ Friedl (left oblique strain) was placed on the 10-day injured list, retroactive to Friday. In 124 at-bats this season, Friedl is hitting .306. INF Matt McClain's contract was selected from Triple-A Louisville, where he was hitting .348 in 38 games.  UP NEXT  Rockies RHP Chase Anderson, claimed off waivers from Tampa Bay on Friday, is to start Tuesday night in his Rockies debut. He pitched five scoreless innings for the Rays in two relief appearances this year.

Some people argue that relaxing with a video game has positive impacts on an individual, while others fear that video games can be addictive and promote negative mood changes.  A new peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Sociological Focus, has sort out to answer this heated debate.  How did the researchers find the answer?  The research team analyzed members of an online football simulation gaming site.  In the simulation, players play as a head coach of a football team. The players compete against one another to have the most successful team. The game also allows for communication between competing players.  The players were surveyed at the beginning and end of each game's season for a period of 10 months.  37 players responded before playing the game, 40 responded after playing the game and 30 responded both before and after.  (credit: INGIMAGE)  The surveys included questions on depressive symptoms and abilities to communicate personal issues. The players were also asked to list how many people in real life and online they spoke to about things impacting them.  “We wanted to showcase the community building and informal relationships built through these online settings,” Dr. Tyler Prochnow from the Department of Health Behavior at Texas A&M University’s School of Public Health said. “Many people feel a sense of community, support, and comfort through online gaming, and I think we need to do a better job measuring these connections and fostering them to improve mental health in today’s digital age.”  What did the research find?  The researchers found that the size and quality of a social network directly impacted depressive episodes. Online social networks enabled people to find support in coping with their problems.  Players without a strong real-life social network were also more likely to use the online network for support. Players in this situation were also more likely to spend a long time online.  Additionally, the researchers found that a sense of community, and the presence of depressive episodes, could alter the social structure of the group over time.  It is worth noting that the study was based on one type of non-violent video game, and thus the findings cannot be applied as a general rule."

After struggling in back-to-back games, Tatum erupted for 51 points – the most in a Game 7 in history — and the Celtics beat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-88 on Sunday to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the second straight year.  One game after missing 14 of his first 15 shots only to awaken in the fourth quarter in time to save their season, Tatum scored 25 in the back-and-forth first half and 17 more in Boston’s 33-10 third quarter that turned a three-point lead into a runaway.  The Celtics, who lost to the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals last year, will face the Miami Heat in the East finals for the second straight season. Game 1 is on Wednesday in Boston.  “I was relieved just to get another chance. Our season could have been over after Game 6,” said Tatum, who broke the Game 7 record of 50 points Stephen Curry set two weeks ago. ""It definitely was on my mind that I had played as bad as it could get, for 43 minutes.  “We had a saying: ‘It’s only up from here.’”  Tatum added 13 rebounds and Jaylen Brown scored 25 points for Boston, which rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the series to keep alive their hopes for an unprecedented 18th NBA championship.  “You always come into a series with the expectation of how it’s supposed to go,” said Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, who is in his first year as an NBA head coach after being promoted on the eve of training camp after Ime Udoka was suspended. “That’s not how the playoffs are.”  Tatum was subbed out of the game with three minutes left to a standing ovation from the crowd, which soon broke out in a “Beat the Heat!” chant. Miami beat Boston in six games in the 2020 East finals and the Celtics took a seven-game matchup last season.  “It’s the best time of the year,” Tatum said. “As a competitor, I love the opportunity.”  Newly crowned NBA MVP Joel Embiid scored 15 points on 5-for-18 shooting, and Tobias Harris scored 19 for Philadelphia. The Sixers lost in the conference semifinals for the third straight year, and the fifth time in six seasons; they have not gotten any farther since reaching the NBA Finals in 2001 despite “The Process” — tanking their way to four top-three draft picks in a row, including Embiid.  “I thought we had the right group. I really did,” said Sixers coach Doc Rivers, who was on the Boston bench when the Celtics won it all in 2008. “We played great all year and this loss absolutely diminishes what we did this year in some way. ... I think this team is headed right. I thought we took another step this season. And then tonight I think we took a step backward. But that’s OK. That happens, too.”  Tatum started 0 for 6 in a Game 5 loss and missed 14 of his first 15 shots overall from the floor in Game 6 before making four 3-pointers in the final 4:14 to force the decisive seventh game.  He picked up where he left off, scoring Boston’s first basket and 11 points in the first quarter, 14 more in the second and outscoring the Sixers on his own, 17-10, in the third. The 33-10 edge in the third was the most lopsided quarter in a Game 7 since at least 1997.  “JT just got it going and get out of that man’s way,"" Brown said. ""He got it rolling, and there’s nothing they could do to stop him.”  Banged-Up Brown  Brown began the game with the black mask he has worn since breaking a bone in his face before the All-Star break. He took it off and soon absorbed an elbow to the face from James Harden, who was assessed a flagrant foul.  Brown continued without the mask but finished the half with cotton in his left nostril. He also played with an edge, making both foul shots and following it with a steal and layup as Boston went on a 9-0 run to erase a 35-26 deficit.  Brown also dove into the Sixers bench to save a ball, then had words with the bench after Georges Niang grabbed his leg and kept him from getting back on the court. Both players were given technical fouls.  Williams followed the commotion with a layup that tied the score 35-all.  “Nothing like a shot to the face to wake you right up,” Brown said.  What's Up, Doc?  Rivers is 6-10 in seventh games. The 10 defeats are five more than any other NBA coach and three more than the NHL's Mike Babcock and Bruce Boudreau. His teams are 6-16 in their last 22 chances to close out an opponent in a playoff series.  Asked if he expected to be back next year, Rivers said: ""Yeah. I think I got two years left. No one is safe in our business and I get that.”  Harden also could be gone if the Sixers opt for an overhaul. He has the opportunity to become a free agent this offseason.  “We’ve got an unfinished job. We haven’t won anything and I think we’ve got the chance to win,"" Embiid said. ""We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I still believe me and him have the chance to win. But it’s going to take more than us.”  Tip-Ins  Tatum is the sixth player since 1997 to score 25 points or more in the first half of a seventh game. The last was Luka Doncic, who had 29 against the Clippers in the first round of the 2021 playoffs. Paul Pierce scored 26 for the Celtics against Cleveland in the second round in 2008. … The 10 points Philadelphia scored were tied for the fewest in any Game 7 quarter in the shot clock era."

With the win, the Hogs secured their seventh SEC series victory of the season and improved to 30-4 at home this year.  Hollan struck out a career-high 10 batters, limiting the Gamecocks to just one run on five hits and one walk. The left-hander threw a season-high 113 pitches in his nine-inning complete game and recorded 19 consecutive outs until a two-out single in the top half of the ninth inning.  The performance marks the Razorbacks’ first complete game of at least nine innings against an SEC team since Dominic Taccolini’s 10-inning complete game shutout against Kentucky in 2016. Hollan is the second Arkansas pitcher to throw a complete game this season after Will McEntire twirled a nine-inning complete game against Louisiana Tech on April 11.  South Carolina’s lone run of the game came via a leadoff home run in the top of the third. Hollan was untouchable from that point forward, however, allowing the Arkansas offense to hit its groove and take control of the ballgame.  John Bolton’s one-out RBI double to right center in the bottom half of the third tied things at one apiece before Parker Rowland’s go-ahead two-run single to center in the fifth. Rowland’s clutch piece of hitting put the Hogs ahead, 3-1.  Arkansas tacked on two more runs with a two-out RBI single by Caleb Cali in the sixth followed by a two-out solo home run by Ben McLaughlin in the eighth, extending the lead to 5-1. Cali and Peyton Holt both finished with a team-leading three hits, and Rowland collected the Razorbacks’ lone multi-RBI performance of the game.  The Hogs’ four-run lead was more than enough for Hollan to protect as he finished off his complete game with a scoreless ninth inning, securing the Razorbacks’ series-clinching win and put the Hogs in the driver’s seat of the SEC.  Arkansas now owns a one-and-a-half-game lead over LSU in the SEC Western Division and a one-game lead over Florida in the overall SEC standings with three games left to play in the regular season.  Up next, the Hogs will travel to Nashville, Tenn., to close out the regular season at Vanderbilt. First pitch between the Razorbacks and Commodores is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday, May 18, on SEC Network.

Despite entering each of the past four seasons with championship expectations, he has managed to lose in the second round four years in a row. His teams led three of the four series after five games, and his team had the higher seed in two of those collapses. Sunday was perhaps the worst of them all. Despite leading for most of the first half, the 76ers fell apart against the Boston Celtics, Rivers' former team, in a 33-10 third-quarter debacle. That gave Rivers his NBA record 10th Game 7 loss. No other head coach has more than five Game 7 losses.  As such, questions have immediately arisen surrounding Rivers' job security. While he initially signed a five-year deal to take over the 76ers in 2020, each playoff defeat has been more devastating than the last and the 76ers will now have to consider whether or not they want to give Rivers the chance to lead them for a fourth season. Rivers addressed the rumors at his post-game press conference Sunday, and while he wouldn't deny the inherent insecurity of his profession, he did suggest that he plans to be back next season. ""Yeah. I think I got two years left,"" Rivers said. ""No one is safe in our business and I get that.""  Rivers isn't the only notable 76er whose future is in question. James Harden can be a free agent after re-signing in Philadelphia on a one-year deal with a player option for a second. Rumors have linked him to his old team, the Houston Rockets, all season. He claimed that he has not thought about free agency yet, but that he thinks his current team still has room to grow. ""It's only Year 1 for us together,"" Harden said.  Looming over every decision Philadelphia makes this offseason is Joel Embiid's future. While the MVP winner is under contract for at least three more seasons, superstars are rarely satisfied with humiliating playoff defeats on a seemingly annual basis. All it will take to upend this franchise is one trade request. Embiid has given no indication yet that he plans to leave Philadelphia, but NBA history tells us that he won't be satisfied with second-round exits forever. Embiid did comment on Rivers' future in Philly after Game 7, saying the coach has done a ""fantastic job.""  That is going to inform whatever the 76ers do with Rivers, Harden and the rest of their team this offseason. The clock was already ticking. After what happened on Sunday, Philadelphia will have to make major moves to keep their best player happy. The logical place to start that process would be with a new coach."

He was 0 for 2 from the field after intermission in the Sixers’ Round 2, Game 6 defeat to the Heat.  On Sunday afternoon at TD Garden, he scored three second-half points. The Celtics then immediately piled up 18 in a row as the Sixers crumbled on their way to another second-round playoff exit, losing Game 7 in a blowout.  Harden had nine points on 3-for-11 shooting, seven assists, six rebounds and five turnovers. Across the Sixers’ four losses in the series, he made a mere 12 of 55 field goals (21.8 percent). While Harden was brilliant in Games 1 and 4 and very solid in Game 5, he and the Sixers were not nearly good enough with the season at stake.  Head coach Doc Rivers gave a generous spin on the 10-time All-Star’s outing.  “I thought James came to play,” Rivers said. “I really did. I thought he was trying to see the game. I thought he played downhill a lot. Where he passed the ball was the right decisions tonight, and we didn’t get anything out of it. I get it. James, (Joel Embiid), me ... I know we’ve got to point somewhere, right? But I thought James, in particular, he was trying to do the right things tonight. I really did.”  Harden, who will turn 34 years old in August, missed 24 games this season, including four in March with left Achilles soreness that he said had been bothering him “for some months.” When healthy, he regularly created excellent shots for everyone around him with inch-perfect hit-ahead feeds, smooth pick-and-roll passes, and well-timed kick-outs. After starting 12-12, the Sixers went an NBA-best 42-16 and were second in offensive rating. Harden led the league in assists for a second time with 10.7 per game.  For next season, he has a player option of $35.6 million.  “James has a decision to make this summer, and he’ll make it,” Rivers said. “I think he overall enjoyed being here. It’s tough for him. We asked him to play a little differently than he’s always been accustomed to. I think it made us a better team. And unfortunately, I thought for James at times, it wasn’t always best for him. But he still did it. You appreciate that as a coach.”  Speaking minutes later in the visiting locker room, Harden didn’t provide much to supplement his coach’s comments on that subject.  “I haven’t even thought about it,” he said of his player option.  What is he looking for next?  “I just want to have a chance to compete,” Harden said. “Compete.”  Harden also offered little when asked about Rivers, whom he’d called “one of the best coaches to ever coach the game of basketball” at his introductory Sixers press conference last February.  “Our relationship is OK,” he said.  Harden did agree with the notion that he and Embiid can further grow their partnership.  “Definitely,” he said. “I feel like we had a pretty solid team. Obviously, you always look to get better, whether it’s the personnel you have now or adding pieces. We’ll see how it goes.”  By next postseason, Embiid will be 30 years old.  “We’ve got an unfinished job,” the MVP big man said. “We haven’t won anything, and I think we’ve got a chance to win. Obviously, going to seven games and having a chance to close it out at home, which we didn’t do. I still believe we’ve got the chance to win. We’ve got what it takes to win. ... I know (Harden) has a player option or they can extend him, but that’s on those guys to figure it out. I’m going to stay out of it, but I still believe that me and him, we’ve got the chance to win.  “It’s going to take more than us. We’ve all got to look at ourselves. I’ve got to be better and I will be better. That’s what I’m focused on. All of us, we’ve got to come back and find ways to just keep improving and help the team. You can’t win alone. I can’t win alone. Me and James, we just can’t win alone. That’s why basketball, it’s played 5-on-5. We just need everybody to keep trying to find ways to get better, and we’ll be fine.”"

Paul DeJong added a solo shot and Arenado drove in four runs for the Cardinals, who won for the sixth time in seven games since an eight-game losing streak. Their previous two wins came on ninth-inning rallies against closer Kenley Jansen at Fenway Park.  Lars Nootbaar had three hits and scored three times for St. Louis, and Paul Goldschmidt added two hits and an RBI. Miles Mikolas (2-1) pitched six innings of one-run ball, allowing four hits with two walks.  “We are a playoff team despite our bad start,” Mikolas said. “The talent is there. We're a very good baseball team.”  Rafael Devers had an RBI single for Boston, which lost for the fifth time in six games.  It was the first series sweep this season for St. Louis (16-25), which owns the NL’s worst record. Arenado homered over the Green Monster once in each game of the series.  The Cardinals finished a six-game road trip to Wrigley Field and Fenway Park at 5-1.  “It's a good road trip,” St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said. “To get back on track and the way we've done it, against two good teams, to be able to go out there with the style of play that has been really good. I know I've said it several times, but that clubhouse has trust in one another.”  Red Sox starter Corey Kluber (2-5) gave up four runs and seven hits — two homers — in five innings. He walked three and struck out five.  “I put us in a hole early,” he said. “I think it just boils down to poor fastball command.”  DeJong’s shot into the center-field seats broke a 1-all tie in the second. Knizner’s drive came in the fourth, also going out to center.  Boston’s Enmanuel Valdez had a two-run homer overturned by review in the seventh on a drive that replays showed hooked foul just short of Pesky's Pole.  Génesis Cabrera escaped a bases-loaded jam in the seventh, getting Masataka Yoshida to fly out to end the inning.  “Played two good games and we lost in the ninth and today they kicked our butt,” Red Sox manager Alex Cora said.  DAD KNOWS  Standing on the field about two hours before the game, Red Sox pitcher Chris Sale asked how the Boston Celtics were doing in Game 7 of their NBA playoff series against Philadelphia. When informed All-Star forward Jayson Tatum had 25 points at halftime, the lefty said: “He’s my oldest son’s favorite athlete. He says it’s me, but I think that’s just to make me feel good. He has two of his jerseys and only one of mine.”  BACK INTO IT  Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras was stretching and squatting with a catcher’s mitt in the clubhouse before the game. After a break from catching, Contreras is slated to be back behind the plate Monday against Milwaukee. He was moved to DH on May 5.

After the Sixers were eliminated in Game 7 of the 2021 NBA Playoffs as a No. 1 seed to the No. 5 Atlanta Hawks, a game in which Simmons infamously passed up a wide-open dunk, he eventually requested a trade in the offseason. He did not play to start the 2022 regular season, citing not being ready mentally, then was traded to Brooklyn in a deal that landed Philadelphia James Harden at the deadline.  But the post-Simmons era has not yielded fruit for Harden, Joel Embiid and Co. either, as they've been bounced in the second round for consecutive seasons.  Simmons played 42 games for the Nets this season and averaged 6.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 1.3 steals in 26.3 minutes per game."

Drury, the sixth seed in the tournament, ends the year with a 30-24 record. Quincy will go to the NCAA-II Tournament with an automatic berth at 44-9.  The Hawks started the game with three runs in the top of first and opened up the lead by posting six runs in the third inning.  Drury got on the board with two runs in the fifth, scoring on a Carson Shaver RBI double, then on a sacrifice fly from Tyler Bastunas.  Quincy, the top scoring offense in the GLVC that averaged more than nine runs per game, kept scoring and added two more in the sixth as well as a single run in the seventh and eighth to lead 13-2.  The Panthers put up four runs in the eighth, highlighted by Shaver’s bases-clearing double that drove in three, but the deficit was too much.  “If you want to beat Quincy, you have to out-pitch them and out-hit them and we weren’t able to do either of those things today,” said Drury head coach Scott Nasby. “We had a long night but a great night last night, but unfortunately, we weren’t able to carry that over to today.”  Jay Hammel (6-2) got the win for the Hawks while Drury starter Cade Waits (5-6) took the loss.  Shaver finished the game going 2 for 4 with two doubles and 4 RBI’s. Graydon Miller went 2 for 3 with two runs and a double.  Hawks DH Austin Simpson went 4 for 5 with 5 RBI’s and he hit his 17th home run of the year.  Drury entered the GLVC Tournament on a seven-game losing streak and was one out away from a loss in Thursday’s opening round as they trailed Maryville 3-1 when Brooks Sunny’s two-RBI single tied the game. The Panthers beat the Saints in 11 innings 6-3, then picked up a 12-4 win over William Jewell on Friday.  Drury had a late start to their game on Saturday as the first pitch was not until 9:40 pm, and in a game that lasted until 1:08 am on Sunday, the Panthers downed Indianapolis 11-4 avenging a loss earlier in the season to UIndy starter Brady Ware, who no-hit Drury while hitting for the cycle at the plate in the same game on April 7.  “I thought we brought some great energy into the tournament,” said Nasby. “We had some great performances offensively and on the mound and had a lot of positivity through the weekend.  “It was good to see some people step up like Graydon Miller, who hadn’t really played at all this year, but came through with some big hits when we needed them this weekend. Brooks Sunny continued to be a clutch player like he was all season, and it was good to see a senior, Carson Shaver, go out playing as well as he did today.”  Sunday’s championship marks the sixth time in program history the Panthers have reached the GLVC title game."

George Springer hit a solo home run for the Blue Jays, who are 12-3 at home this season.  “This team’s resilient,” Jansen said. “We’re looking to win every game, and we believe that we can with the bats and the staff we have.”  With Toronto trailing 5-4, Vladimir Guerrero thought he tied the game to begin the ninth, pumping his fist as he watched his deep drive to right, but Guerrero was held to a single when the ball hit the wall.

The Braves made three errors and the Blue Jays had two defensive miscues, both by Gold Glove third baseman Chapman. Toronto pitchers also made a pair of wild pitches.  Snitker said he didn’t realize how windy it was on the field with the roof at Rogers Centre open until he came out to replace right-hander Collin McHugh in the second.  Pillar, who played with Toronto from 2013 until 2019, agreed that the conditions were “difficult” Sunday.  “You don’t feel a lot of the wind at ground level, it’s kind of up higher when those balls get up there,” Pillar said. “The ball was moving all over the place.”  Acuña homered on left-hander Yusei Kikuchi’s third pitch of the game, the 28th leadoff homer of his career, and Michael Harris II made it 2-0 with an RBI single in the second.  Toronto responded with three runs in the bottom of the second. Brandon Belt hit an RBI single and Guerrero’s base hit drove in a pair of runs.  Albies connected in the third, his 10th homer of the season.  Pillar made it 5-3 in the fourth when he homered against his former team, his fourth of the season, but Springer cut the Blue Jays’ deficit to one when he answered in the bottom half with a solo drive to left, his fifth.  McHugh made his first start of the season for Atlanta. He gave up three runs and six hits in 1 2/3 innings.  Kikuchi allowed five runs, four earned, and nine hits in 4-plus innings.  WELCOME BACK  Pillar got a standing ovation before he batted in the second, his first at bat of the series and first appearance in Toronto since April 24, 2019, with San Francisco.  “It’s definitely really special to come back that many years later and to be remembered and to be appreciated,” Pillar said. “It was overwhelming.”  TABLE SETTER  Acuña reached base four times and scored twice. He leads the NL in hits (54), total bases (90), runs scored (36), stolen bases (17).  UP NEXT  Braves: RHP Charlie Morton (4-3, 3.32) starts Monday when Atlanta begins a three-game series at Texas. The Rangers have not named a starter.  Blue Jays: RHP Alek Manoah (1-3, 4.83) starts Monday when Toronto hosts the New York Yankees for a four-game series. New York has not named a starter.  ------  AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP--Sports"

(WTVM) - Northside Christian Church hosted an adaptive needs sports game this weekend.  Mother’s Day was on the minds of many adaptive sports participants at this month’s adaptive sports game that was held on Saturday.  Volleyball was the game of choice for the month.  The church has been hosting sports games for kids, and older people with disabilities and challenges, to give them a chance to learn a sport and play among their peers.  Participants were also able to create a special gift of flowers for the mom in their life.  As the program wraps up for the Spring, volunteers say they need more people to come out and help with their upcoming summer camp.  “Just like we do here, we assign every child a buddy. The buddy just hangs out with them during the course of the event, so they can direct them, like we may be coming back for snack, or they may need help with a skill, and things like that so that’s really what we need volunteers for,” says Volunteer Buddy Coordinator Vikki Hutchinson.  The adaptive program’s summer camp starts June 7 and ends June 9, and volunteers are needed to help kids that are on a waitlist. If you want to participate, contact the church at (706) 324-5220.

""We’re going to bring it home all the way this year.”  “It was an electric environment,"" said Patriots player Julian Edelman. ""There’s a Boston vs. Philly thing that we’ve had the last decade.""  The Celtics won with 24 points ahead of the 76ers by the end of the game, sending them to the Eastern Conference Finals to go against the Miami Heat.

The 3rd overall pick of the 2017 Draft broke a league record on Sunday for the most points in a Game 7 match.  “I thought he was hot as fish grease but nah I said he’s hot as whale grease. Because that dude was cooking,"" said a Cedric Maxwell, retired Celtic and radio broadcaster.  Philly's best hardly showed up, and former Celtics Head Coach Doc Rivers now has the most Game 7 losses of any coach in league history.  “[I] Was expecting a bounce back game from Harden after a brutal Game 5 and 6, but just did not get it,"" said a 76ers fan at the Garden.  The Celtics are up against the 76ers tomorrow (Sunday) at TD Garden for Game 7, and the city of Boston is behind them.  Philly didn't show up in part because of how Boston's fans did after Jaylen Brown called them out following Game 6.  ""Y'all love to call us out,"" said Brown. ""I'm calling you guys out this time. The energy in the garden has been okay at best all [of] playoffs.""  After Sunday's victory, Brown said this: ""Way to respond. The energy in the building was through the roof, it was amazing.""  “Jaylen was right!"" said actor Donnie Wahlberg. ""Watch our interview from a week ago. I said the same thing. It hasn’t quite been the energy level! Tonight they answered the call. Jaylen was right to call everyone out.”  Brandy Cole chats with Latoyia Edwards ahead of Mother's Day, when her son, Jayson Tatum, and the Celtics will play in Game 7 against the 76ers.  Celtics fans answered the call, some even cancelling plans to see them play.  ""We had an anniversary dinner planned for this week, but we decided the money was better spent on Game 7 tickets, said Brittany Hopkins.  “Wow. It was the best way to spend a five year anniversary,"" said Hopkin's boyfriend Sam Coveny.  Fans outside of TD Garden said Tatum's role in the Game 7 victory solidified his Celtics legacy.  ""He’s stamped,"" said Celtics fan Benjamin Tranfaglia. ""He’s solidified. He needs to bring that ring home. But after that performance and a few others? He’s stamped."""
