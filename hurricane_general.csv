Louisiana-Monroe defensive lineman Anthony Campbell and junior college wide receiver Shemar Kirk committed to Miami on Saturday. The Miami baseball team dropped the second of a three-game series in a 7-4 loss at Pittsburgh on Saturday.  Campbell provides the Miami Hurricanes football program with needed size on the DL at 6’7 and 283 pounds. Campbell spent two seasons at Louisiana-Monroe and was at Independence Kansas Junior College for a pair of seasons prior to that. Campbell had 13 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and one sack at Louisiana Monroe.  Kirk comes to Miami from Reedley California Community College. Miami gains an explosive and speedy receiver that had 76 receptions for 1,446 yards a 19.0 yards per catch average and 15 touchdowns per Gaby Urruita of Inside the U. At 6’1 and 190 pounds Kirk will provide Miami with size as well as speed on the outside.  The Miami Hurricanes baseball team took a 2-0 lead in the top of the third inning. Pittsburgh answered with a grand slam by Kyle Hess and never looked back. Zach Levenson had three hits in five at-bats with a home run and two RBIs on Saturday for Miami. Miami Hurricanes pitchers issued 10 walks on Saturday.  Kirk is the second transfer WR Miami has added in as many days. Former Alabama and Louisville WR Tyler Harrell committed to Miami on Friday. Mario Cristobal finally was able to add the WRs he said were priorities during his Early National Signing Day press conference in December. Miami has added critical speed offensively.  Miami also had a key weekend hosting recruits. Five-star prospects, DL David Stone and WR Mylan Graham visited Miami this weekend. Ohio State is the prohibitive favorite to receive a commitment from Graham. Oklahoma is a big favorite for a commitment from Stone who is the second-ranked 2024 DL."
