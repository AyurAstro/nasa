Related: FBI investigation into Trump-Russia collusion relied on shaky intelligence, says John Durham report ‚Äì live updates  The Durham report was sharply critical of how the FBI decided to open the counterintelligence investigation into Trump, known as ‚ÄúCrossfire Hurricane‚Äù, accusing top officials at the bureau of relying on raw and uncorroborated information to continue the inquiry.  Much of the criticism of the FBI in the roughly 300-page report was already known when the justice department inspector general issued its own report, which raised similar concerns but ultimately concluded that the FBI investigation into Trump was justified.  The Durham report was more scathing, finding that the FBI moved quickly on a vague tip about potential contacts between a Trump campaign aide and Russian officials in July 2016 based on ‚Äúraw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated evidence‚Äù in a ‚Äúdeparture from how it approached‚Äù the Clinton campaign.  But Durham‚Äôs inquiry failed to uncover any blockbuster revelations suggesting the bureau targeted Trump out of political motivations, and the report at times came across as a defense of his lengthy investigation.  Also contained in the report:  Durham said the FBI was more cautious of allegations of foreign influence when it came to the Clinton campaign, and did not pursue evidence in two cases of foreign governments trying to gain influence with Clinton while providing defensive briefings, unlike with the Trump campaign;  Durham said the FBI was overly reliant on investigative tips from Trump‚Äôs political opponents and did not rigorously analyze the information it received, which extended the investigation and led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump;  Durham said the FBI decided to move ahead with Crossfire Hurricane despite a lack of information from the intelligence community that corroborated the hypothesis on which it was predicated and FBI agents ignored information that exonerated key people in the case;  Durham suggested that Crossfire Hurricane was ‚Äútriggered‚Äù by the so-called Steele dossier, when it was in fact based on a tip from an Australian diplomat in London that a Trump campaign aide appeared to have advance knowledge about Russia releasing damaging information on Clinton.  The top FBI officials who oversaw the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and left the bureau years ago have long maintained that they had a duty to investigate allegations that Russia, a strategic US adversary, was seeking to garner influence with Trump, who had no experience in government.  The delivery of the report to the attorney general Merrick Garland and to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate judiciary committees several hours before it was made public, largely marks the end of the nearly four-year investigation led by Durham.  Durham‚Äôs appointment as special counsel by former attorney general William Barr was unusual in that he was essentially tasked with investigating a different special counsel ‚Äì Mueller.  The investigation was beset by controversy, including when Barr pressed Durham to draft an interim report just before the 2020 election, a directive that gave rise to allegations of improper political interference.  In September 2020, according to the New York Times, one of the prosecutors on Durham‚Äôs team and former acting US attorney Nora Dannehy discovered that other members of the team had written a draft report that she had not been told about.  Dannehy was reportedly furious and told Durham that no report should be issued before the investigation had been completed and especially not relying on disputed information that could impact the election. Dannehy sent her colleagues a memo about her concerns and resigned.  While Trump once predicted that Durham would uncover the ‚Äúcrime of the century‚Äù, the investigation proved to be defective in court. Two people he charged were acquitted in court, and only the former FBI lawyer who altered an email to help prepare a wiretap application pleaded guilty.  After the second acquittal ‚Äì Igor Danchenko, a researcher who was a primary source for the 2016 dossier alleging Trump‚Äôs ties to Russia was found not guilty about lying to the FBI about where he got his information ‚Äì Democrats called for Durham‚Äôs team to be shut down as a waste of taxpayer money.  The Durham report ended without recommending any wholesale changes at the FBI, but suggested the creation of a position at the bureau to provide oversight of politically sensitive investigations with the power to challenge every step of investigations, including for wiretaps.  Durham‚Äôs investigation was recorded as costing about $6.5m as of last December. Durham, a longtime federal prosecutor who was the US attorney in Connecticut during the Trump administration, was allowed to stay in his role by the current attorney general until the completion of his work.  Two cases that Durham took to court ended in failure. Last year, a jury found cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussman not guilty of lying to the FBI. A jury also found Danchenko not guilty of making false statements to the FBI in October, in a case argued personally by Durham.  Durham extracted a guilty plea from Clinesmith, who was sentenced to one year of probation after admitting in a 2020 plea agreement that he had altered a government email that a colleague then used to justify to a secret surveillance court the wiretap of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page."

The Carolina Hurricanes‚Äô forward has shed his no-contact jersey and participated in a full practice Monday ahead of the Eastern Conference Final against Florida. Teravainen hasn‚Äôt played since he suffered a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders.  It‚Äôs unclear exactly when he might be ready to play, though his return would be a lift for a team that has kept advancing despite injuries to top-line forwards.  ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm pretty much ready to go,‚Äù Teravainen said after Monday‚Äôs practice. ‚ÄúSo whenever coach puts me out there, I‚Äôll be good.‚Äù  Rod Brind‚ÄôAmour wouldn‚Äôt say definitively when that would be, though he noted the extra rest from the series schedule ‚Äî still unset as of Monday‚Äôs practice ‚Äî could help.  Advertisement  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs healthy enough,‚Äù Brind‚ÄôAmour said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just whether or not he can play. ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not going to throw him in if he can‚Äôt shoot.‚Äù  Teravainen was hurt when New York‚Äôs Jean-Gabriel Pageau struck the forward‚Äôs hands in an uncalled slashing penalty, with an angry Brind‚ÄôAmour saying afterward that Pageau ‚Äúabsolutely tomahawk chops him, absolutely.‚Äù  At the time, Brind‚ÄôAmour had said Teravainen had a broken hand that would require surgery. More specifically, the injury turned out to be Teravainen‚Äôs left thumb, evidenced by the thick pinkish-brown scar running through the center and along the length of his thumb that was visible as he spoke to reporters in the locker room.  He had recently returned to skating with a few teammates and had been building up his on-ice work. On Monday, that meant rotating in on the penalty kill and other stretches of practice.  Wednesday marks four weeks since the April 19 injury, with surgery following the next day.  SUNDAY‚ÄôS LATE GAME  Advertisement  GOLDEN KNIGHTS 5, OILERS 2: Jonathan Marchessault scored three goals for his second career postseason hat trick as visiting Vegas beat Edmonton in Game 6 of their second-round series to advance to the Western Conference final.  Reilly Smith and William Karlsson also scored for the Golden Knights, and Ivan Barbashev had two assists. Adin Hill finished with 39 saves.  Connor McDavid and Warren Foegele scored early in the first period for Edmonton, which led 2-1 less than three minutes into the game. Stuart Skinner gave up four goals on 17 shots through two periods, and Jack Campbell stopped all four shots he faced in the third.  Vegas is back in the NHL semifinals for the fourth time in the franchise‚Äôs six-year history, and will next face the winner of the series between Dallas and Seattle, which heads to a Game 7 on Monday night.  ¬´ Previous  Next ¬ª"

Louisiana-Monroe defensive lineman Anthony Campbell and junior college wide receiver Shemar Kirk committed to Miami on Saturday. The Miami baseball team dropped the second of a three-game series in a 7-4 loss at Pittsburgh on Saturday.  Campbell provides the Miami Hurricanes football program with needed size on the DL at 6‚Äô7 and 283 pounds. Campbell spent two seasons at Louisiana-Monroe and was at Independence Kansas Junior College for a pair of seasons prior to that. Campbell had 13 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and one sack at Louisiana Monroe.  Kirk comes to Miami from Reedley California Community College. Miami gains an explosive and speedy receiver that had 76 receptions for 1,446 yards a 19.0 yards per catch average and 15 touchdowns per Gaby Urruita of Inside the U. At 6‚Äô1 and 190 pounds Kirk will provide Miami with size as well as speed on the outside.  The Miami Hurricanes baseball team took a 2-0 lead in the top of the third inning. Pittsburgh answered with a grand slam by Kyle Hess and never looked back. Zach Levenson had three hits in five at-bats with a home run and two RBIs on Saturday for Miami. Miami Hurricanes pitchers issued 10 walks on Saturday.  Kirk is the second transfer WR Miami has added in as many days. Former Alabama and Louisville WR Tyler Harrell committed to Miami on Friday. Mario Cristobal finally was able to add the WRs he said were priorities during his Early National Signing Day press conference in December. Miami has added critical speed offensively.  Miami also had a key weekend hosting recruits. Five-star prospects, DL David Stone and WR Mylan Graham visited Miami this weekend. Ohio State is the prohibitive favorite to receive a commitment from Graham. Oklahoma is a big favorite for a commitment from Stone who is the second-ranked 2024 DL."
