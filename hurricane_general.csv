Related: FBI investigation into Trump-Russia collusion relied on shaky intelligence, says John Durham report – live updates  The Durham report was sharply critical of how the FBI decided to open the counterintelligence investigation into Trump, known as “Crossfire Hurricane”, accusing top officials at the bureau of relying on raw and uncorroborated information to continue the inquiry.  Much of the criticism of the FBI in the roughly 300-page report was already known when the justice department inspector general issued its own report, which raised similar concerns but ultimately concluded that the FBI investigation into Trump was justified.  The Durham report was more scathing, finding that the FBI moved quickly on a vague tip about potential contacts between a Trump campaign aide and Russian officials in July 2016 based on “raw, unanalyzed and uncorroborated evidence” in a “departure from how it approached” the Clinton campaign.  But Durham’s inquiry failed to uncover any blockbuster revelations suggesting the bureau targeted Trump out of political motivations, and the report at times came across as a defense of his lengthy investigation.  Also contained in the report:  Durham said the FBI was more cautious of allegations of foreign influence when it came to the Clinton campaign, and did not pursue evidence in two cases of foreign governments trying to gain influence with Clinton while providing defensive briefings, unlike with the Trump campaign;  Durham said the FBI was overly reliant on investigative tips from Trump’s political opponents and did not rigorously analyze the information it received, which extended the investigation and led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Trump;  Durham said the FBI decided to move ahead with Crossfire Hurricane despite a lack of information from the intelligence community that corroborated the hypothesis on which it was predicated and FBI agents ignored information that exonerated key people in the case;  Durham suggested that Crossfire Hurricane was “triggered” by the so-called Steele dossier, when it was in fact based on a tip from an Australian diplomat in London that a Trump campaign aide appeared to have advance knowledge about Russia releasing damaging information on Clinton.  The top FBI officials who oversaw the Crossfire Hurricane investigation and left the bureau years ago have long maintained that they had a duty to investigate allegations that Russia, a strategic US adversary, was seeking to garner influence with Trump, who had no experience in government.  The delivery of the report to the attorney general Merrick Garland and to the top Democrats and Republicans on the House and Senate judiciary committees several hours before it was made public, largely marks the end of the nearly four-year investigation led by Durham.  Durham’s appointment as special counsel by former attorney general William Barr was unusual in that he was essentially tasked with investigating a different special counsel – Mueller.  The investigation was beset by controversy, including when Barr pressed Durham to draft an interim report just before the 2020 election, a directive that gave rise to allegations of improper political interference.  In September 2020, according to the New York Times, one of the prosecutors on Durham’s team and former acting US attorney Nora Dannehy discovered that other members of the team had written a draft report that she had not been told about.  Dannehy was reportedly furious and told Durham that no report should be issued before the investigation had been completed and especially not relying on disputed information that could impact the election. Dannehy sent her colleagues a memo about her concerns and resigned.  While Trump once predicted that Durham would uncover the “crime of the century”, the investigation proved to be defective in court. Two people he charged were acquitted in court, and only the former FBI lawyer who altered an email to help prepare a wiretap application pleaded guilty.  After the second acquittal – Igor Danchenko, a researcher who was a primary source for the 2016 dossier alleging Trump’s ties to Russia was found not guilty about lying to the FBI about where he got his information – Democrats called for Durham’s team to be shut down as a waste of taxpayer money.  The Durham report ended without recommending any wholesale changes at the FBI, but suggested the creation of a position at the bureau to provide oversight of politically sensitive investigations with the power to challenge every step of investigations, including for wiretaps.  Durham’s investigation was recorded as costing about $6.5m as of last December. Durham, a longtime federal prosecutor who was the US attorney in Connecticut during the Trump administration, was allowed to stay in his role by the current attorney general until the completion of his work.  Two cases that Durham took to court ended in failure. Last year, a jury found cybersecurity lawyer Michael Sussman not guilty of lying to the FBI. A jury also found Danchenko not guilty of making false statements to the FBI in October, in a case argued personally by Durham.  Durham extracted a guilty plea from Clinesmith, who was sentenced to one year of probation after admitting in a 2020 plea agreement that he had altered a government email that a colleague then used to justify to a secret surveillance court the wiretap of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page."

Four-star 2024 cornerback Dakoda Fields told Greg Biggins of 247 Sports that he is planning on visiting the Miami football visit after naming the Hurricanes in his top seven. It has been a big recruiting weekend for Miami.  After Pittsburgh rallied from a 4-2 deficit the Miami Hurricanes baseball team scored a run in the top of the seventh and held on for a 5-4 win to clinch the series. Andrew Walter recorded the last seven outs allowing one hit and registering four strikeouts for his ninth save. Miami plays at FIU on Tuesday night.  Fields spoke with Biggins after announcing his top seven this weekend. Miami, Oregon and USC are currently scheduled to receive an official visit from Fields in June. Secondary coach Jahmile Addae is leading the recruitment for Fields. Fields spoke about a prior visit with Miami and his relationship with Addae.  The additions of defensive lineman Anthony Campbell and wide receiver Ty Harrell over the weekend moved the Miami 2023 transfer class to ninth nationally. Miami also added junior college transfer WR Shemar Kirk on Saturday who does not count towards the 2023 Miami transfer class.  Miami addressed some key positions in this second transfer window with additions at defensive tackle, cornerback, wide receiver, and running back. Most importantly, I think they got quality at those spots and not just bodies to fill a hole. Eager to see these guys in action. — Gaby Urrutia (@GabyUrrutia247) May 13, 2023  The Miami football program hosted five-star prospects, cornerback Ellis Robinson, linebacker Jadon Perlotte and wide receiver Mylan Graham and four-stars, tight ends Caleb Odom and Brock Schott, athlete Brauntae Johnson, safety Jaylen Heyward and LB Nathaniel Owusu-Boateng in Coral Gables this weekend.  USA Today’s College Sports Wire wrote about “One must-see game in each week of the 2023 season.” Texas A&M at Miami week three was named honorable mention. Miami at Florida State was named the game to watch in week 11. Florida State was also named the game of week four when the Seminoles play at Clemson.  Kamren Kinchens is the top returning Power Five safety for 2023 as tweeted by Pro Football Focus on Sunday. Kinchens received a 90.0 grade from PFF during the 2022 season. Aubrey Banks of West Virginia was second with an 84.9 grade. Only two other ACC safeties are ranked in the PFF top 10."

Dallas moves on to play first-year Stars coach Pete DeBoer’s former team, the Vegas Golden Knights. Game 1 of the West final is Friday night in Las Vegas.  DeBoer improved to 7-0 in Game 7s, this being the fourth team he led to a win in the finale of a best-of-seven series that went the distance.  Darryl Sutter and Scott Bowman are the only other coaches to do that.  It was the fourth time in five seasons the Stars got a Game 7 — the others were all away from home. They hadn’t won a Game 7 at home since 2000, when they made the Stanley Cup Final. In the only other Game 7 they hosted at American Airlines Center, the Stars lost 6-1 to St. Louis in a second-round series in 2016.  Johnston made it 2-0 with 7:12 left, when he gathered a puck that ricocheted off the back boards to the left of the Seattle net. He then sent a shot that went off the shoulder and mask of goalie Phillip Grubauer before going into the net.  Advertisement  Grubauer stopped 26 shots, two weeks after making 32 saves when Seattle won at Colorado 2-1 in another Game 7 to knock out last year’s Stanley Cup champion.  Hintz’s ninth goal of the playoffs was credited as an unassisted tally and came with 4:01 left in the second period, the deepest in this series any game got before a score.  Oliver Bjorkstrand scored with 17.6 seconds left, preventing the shutout for 24-year-old Stars goalie Jake Oettinger, who finished with 21 saves.  It was exactly one year after Oettinger’s 64-save performance in another Game 7 — a 3-2 loss at Calgary after Johnny Gaudreau’s OT goal ended the first-round series.  The 24-year-old Oettinger improved to 5-0 after losses this postseason. He allowed four goals on 18 shots during Game 6 in Seattle on Saturday, when he was pulled 4 1/2 minutes into the second period.  Dallas and Las Vegas will meet in the Western Conference Final for the second time in four seasons. The Stars beat the DeBoer-coached Golden Knights in five games in 2020, the postseason that was played in the NHL’s bubble in Toronto and Edmonton during the pandemic.  Advertisement  NOTES  HURRICANES: Teuvo Teravainen’s roughly monthlong injury absence appears to be near an end.  The Carolina Hurricanes’ forward has shed his no-contact jersey and participated in a full practice Monday ahead of the Eastern Conference Final against Florida. Teravainen hasn’t played since he suffered a hand injury in Game 2 of the first-round series against the New York Islanders.  It’s unclear exactly when he might be ready to play, though his return would be a lift for a team that has kept advancing despite injuries to top-line forwards.  “I think I’m pretty much ready to go,” Teravainen said after Monday’s practice. “So whenever coach puts me out there, I’ll be good.”  Rod Brind’Amour wouldn’t say definitively when that would be, though he noted the extra rest from the series schedule — still unset as of Monday’s practice — could help.  Advertisement  “He’s healthy enough,” Brind’Amour said. “It’s just whether or not he can play. … I’m not going to throw him in if he can’t shoot.”  Teravainen was hurt when New York’s Jean-Gabriel Pageau struck the forward’s hands in an uncalled slashing penalty, with an angry Brind’Amour saying afterward that Pageau “absolutely tomahawk chops him, absolutely.”  At the time, Brind’Amour had said Teravainen had a broken hand that would require surgery. More specifically, the injury turned out to be Teravainen’s left thumb, evidenced by the thick pinkish-brown scar running through the center and along the length of his thumb that was visible as he spoke to reporters in the locker room.  He had recently returned to skating with a few teammates and had been building up his on-ice work. On Monday, that meant rotating in on the penalty kill and other stretches of practice.  Wednesday marks four weeks since the April 19 injury, with surgery following the next day.  SUNDAY’S LATE GAME  Advertisement  GOLDEN KNIGHTS 5, OILERS 2: Jonathan Marchessault scored three goals for his second career postseason hat trick as visiting Vegas beat Edmonton in Game 6 of their second-round series to advance to the Western Conference final.  Reilly Smith and William Karlsson also scored for the Golden Knights, and Ivan Barbashev had two assists. Adin Hill finished with 39 saves.  Connor McDavid and Warren Foegele scored early in the first period for Edmonton, which led 2-1 less than three minutes into the game. Stuart Skinner gave up four goals on 17 shots through two periods, and Jack Campbell stopped all four shots he faced in the third.  Vegas is back in the NHL semifinals for the fourth time in the franchise’s six-year history, and will next face the winner of the series between Dallas and Seattle, which heads to a Game 7 on Monday night.  « Previous  Next »"

Louisiana-Monroe defensive lineman Anthony Campbell and junior college wide receiver Shemar Kirk committed to Miami on Saturday. The Miami baseball team dropped the second of a three-game series in a 7-4 loss at Pittsburgh on Saturday.  Campbell provides the Miami Hurricanes football program with needed size on the DL at 6’7 and 283 pounds. Campbell spent two seasons at Louisiana-Monroe and was at Independence Kansas Junior College for a pair of seasons prior to that. Campbell had 13 tackles, 3.5 tackles for loss and one sack at Louisiana Monroe.  Kirk comes to Miami from Reedley California Community College. Miami gains an explosive and speedy receiver that had 76 receptions for 1,446 yards a 19.0 yards per catch average and 15 touchdowns per Gaby Urruita of Inside the U. At 6’1 and 190 pounds Kirk will provide Miami with size as well as speed on the outside.  The Miami Hurricanes baseball team took a 2-0 lead in the top of the third inning. Pittsburgh answered with a grand slam by Kyle Hess and never looked back. Zach Levenson had three hits in five at-bats with a home run and two RBIs on Saturday for Miami. Miami Hurricanes pitchers issued 10 walks on Saturday.  Kirk is the second transfer WR Miami has added in as many days. Former Alabama and Louisville WR Tyler Harrell committed to Miami on Friday. Mario Cristobal finally was able to add the WRs he said were priorities during his Early National Signing Day press conference in December. Miami has added critical speed offensively.  Miami also had a key weekend hosting recruits. Five-star prospects, DL David Stone and WR Mylan Graham visited Miami this weekend. Ohio State is the prohibitive favorite to receive a commitment from Graham. Oklahoma is a big favorite for a commitment from Stone who is the second-ranked 2024 DL."
