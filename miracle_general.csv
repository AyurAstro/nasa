As the Holy See, aided by the Archdiocese of Hartford, investigates the case, parishioners are hoping that church officials eventually recognize the miracle as the genuine article.  “We’re all waiting in suspense for word from Rome,” congregant James Clark, 51, told the Post on Monday. “I believe in my heart that it’s real, but obviously you need confirmation before you can say with absolute certainty that a miracle occurred.  “It’s just so heartening to know that God’s children haven’t gotten so spiritually bereft to where He still won’t give us a sign every now and then, a little nibble, to bring us back to f"

(WBTV/Gray News) - Three people are dead after a truck fleeing law enforcement crashed into a home in Shelby, North Carolina, on Sunday, WBTV reports.  The incident started in Blacksburg, South Carolina, according to the Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office.  According to deputies, dispatch received a call Sunday around 12:55 a.m. that a white pickup was following and shooting into the caller’s Dodge Charger.  After the chase reached North Carolina, the 911 call was transferred around 1:07 a.m. to the Cleveland County dispatch center.  Deputies from Cleveland County say they tried to stop the suspects, but the truck fled by running a red light and headed onto Highway 74 West, turned onto Dekalb Street and turned off the headlights.  According to deputies, they lost sight of the truck momentarily but found it crashed into the home.  The pickup driver allegedly fled from deputies by running a red light. The truck headed onto Highway 74 West, turned onto Dekalb Street and the headlights were turned off before crashing into a house.  The homeowner said that after nearly 50 years of living in the home on Suttle Street, he’s glad to still have his life. Others in the neighborhood said the incident was unlike anything they’ve ever seen.  “What I see is a lot of destruction and a lot of craziness,” neighbor Franklin Batten said. “I never seen bodies before or people die in an accident like this before. I never witnessed it in my life.”  Officials with the Shelby Police Department said six men were in the car at the time, five between the ages of 15 and 20.  Officers say three of the men have died, three were taken to the hospital and one was released.  No one in the car that was being chased was hurt.  “Given the relentlessness with which these suspects pursued and shot at the victims, it is a miracle that no one in the victims’ car was injured. I am proud of the joint effort between all the involved agencies to work through this investigation,” Cleveland County Sheriff Alan Norman said.  Copyright 2023 WBTV via Gray Media Group, Inc.

The UKLASH Eyelash Serum, £37.99 here , has been praised for giving users longer, fuller eyelashes, and Molly-Mae was keen to try out the product for herself. In a YouTube video posted on Thursday, the influencer talked through some of her upcoming beauty journeys, including whitening her teeth and trying out the UKLASH serum.  Molly-Mae said: ""Another thing that I've also been trying, I've seen so many girls on TikTok and YouTube and all over the place talking about their lash growth journey"". Molly-Mae revealed that her eyelashes were affected during her pregnancy, admitting a combination of the postpartum hair loss and rubbing her eyes caused them to thin and shorten.  (Image: Molly-Mae Hague/Youtube) (Image: UKLASH)  Molly-Mae told her viewers: ""My lashes were definitely one thing that took a hit through my pregnancy. I also have a really bad habit of rubbing my eyes a lot.  ""My lashes over the last few months and over my pregnancy have really thinned out, so I bought UKLASH. Which I've heard literally works miracles for growing your lashes.""  The lash serum has been lauded as a miracle worker for helping revive short, thin, or sparse eyelashes, and helping them become thicker and fuller, with users typically seeing results in 8-12 weeks. Consistency is the key to seeing results, with UKLASH recommending you apply the serum every night to get the results you want.  During her YouTube video, Molly-Mae confessed that she struggles to remember to do something every day. The former Love Island star said: “I’ve only just started using this, I’ve only done like three nights of applying it, then I actually missed a night. If there’s something that needs to be done every day, don’t count on me to do it…I guarantee even if I put it beside my bed I’ll forget, but I’m going to try not to because I really want to see an improvement with my lashes.”  The UKLASH Serum contains biotin peptides which are vital for healthy hair growth and Myristoyl Pentapeptide-17 which stimulates keratin growth. It also contains green tea extract, which helps to grow long fluttery lashes, and vitamin B5 which smooths, conditions and supports your lashes to make them look thicker and healthier.  (Image: Molly-Mae Hague/Youtube)  To use the serum, first make sure you’ve removed all your makeup using an oil-free cleanser, then apply a single swipe of the serum along your lashline, just like you would when applying eyeliner. The UKLASH website suggests that a single dip of the product should be enough to cover both eyelashes, then leave the product to work overnight.  There’s even a money back guarantee if you don’t see results within 12 weeks of proper use, so if you’re sceptical about it working, you know you won’t be out of pocket if you don’t see any results.

The deer was found fatally wounded after being hit by a car. A game warden arrived and shot the deer in the head to try and end the animal’s suffering.  ""That’s part of their job,"" said Glen Bryant, President of All Things Wild Rehabilitation. ""You wouldn’t want someone that is in bad shape to be left on oxygen just to keep them around if they’re in a lot of pain. It’s the same way for the animal. They’re here to do what’s best for the animal.""  However, when rescuers arrived the injured deer was still alive. It managed to survive getting hit by a car and being shot. Then, the wildlife group noticed movement in the deer’s belly. The nearly dead deer was pregnant.

Moments before the doe’s death, crews performed an emergency C-section and pulled two fawns from her body.  ""It makes you really proud,"" said Foxworth. ""It makes your heart smile and bring a tear to your eyes to know that you did something good in this crazy world.""  All Things Wild plans to care for the fawns until they reach a safe age to be released into the wild.  ""It was a miracle that they survived,"" said Scott.

The close game came to an end after Notre Dame gained draw control in the seconds to remain, stripping UF of any chance to pull off a miracle.  The No. 6 Florida Gators (17-4, 5-1 AAC) lost to the No. 8 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (15-5, 6-3 ACC) 16-15 Sunday in the National Collegiate Athletics Association Women’s Lacrosse Championship tournament.  “To play a team like that, who is so good, you need to play a full 60 minute game,” Florida head coach Amanda O’Leary said.  Notre Dame scored the first goal of the game after gaining draw control. However, the Gators quickly showed their opponent this would be a close matchup and scored three consecutive goals in the minutes that followed.  Florida senior Emily Heller scored the first goal for UF in the 11th minute. Following was a goal from Gators junior Ashley Gonzalez fed by her teammate junior Maggi Hall. The third goal was from Florida sophomore Emma LoPinto. UF took an early 3-2 advantage through the first period.

Kiwior has impressed having come into the starting lineup to replace Rob Holding in recent weeks, as William Saliba remains on the sidelines through injury.  The £21m centre-back went down holding his foot after his boot came off under the challenge of Brighton’s Evan Ferguson, before a cross was delivered right over Kiwior’s head to allow Enciso to easily nod past Aaron Ramsdale.  Deniz Undav and Pervis Estupinan added to the Seagull’s lead to give them a convincing and deserved 3-0 win and leave the Gunners needing a miracle to claim the title over Manchester City, who are now four points clear with a game in hand.  After the defeat, Micah Richards attempted to defend Kiwior before Keane dismissed his fellow pundit’s thoughts in typically brutal style: “You talk about putting your body on the line, last-ditch defending and stuff, you don’t stay down like that. Micah, his boot came off, his foot didn’t come off.”  The Poland international explained after the game: “I felt contact and lost my boot and didn’t even see the goal. I hoped VAR would intervene and chalk off the goal, but unfortunately, the ref saw it differently.  “After we conceded the second our heads dropped and we couldn’t come back,” he added.  READ MORE: Arsenal taught £77m lesson by brilliant Brighton and De Zerbi as title finally slips from Arteta’s grasp  Gary Neville weighed in on commentary, claiming Kiwior just had to “stand up” whether he thought he was fouled or not.  He said: “Kiwior is injured but the fact that he was injured, I mean… He goes down holding his ankle and left Arsenal short in the middle of the box.  “He goes down. Can he not just – I’m scared of saying it… And I’m sure the lads in the studio, Roy [Keane] and Patrick [Viera], might be thinking it and have a bit more to say.  Story continues  “If you’re injured you’re injured. But as a centre half, surely you just have to stand up and let the attack finish?”  Jamie Carragher took to Twitter to label the moment embarraassing.  He wrote: ‘It was a embarrassing Kiwior stayed down whether it was a foul or not (it wasn’t) there was very little wrong with him.

Photograph: BCCI  IPL 2023 has been a roller coaster ride with nail-biting finishes and heart-stopping moments, but Sunday's doubleheaders were a snooze-fest.  CSK fans must have clung to their seats hoping for a miracle from their beloved Thala to pull off a master-stroke, but alas, it was not meant to be.  Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh continued their brilliant run of form as they pulled off one of the surprise results of the season to breach fortress Chepauk, with the Kolkata Knight Riders defeating Chennai Super Kings by six wickets.  Chasing 145, KKR lost three quick wickets in the Powerplay with Deepak Chahar taking three wickets, dismissing Rahmunllah Gurbaz, Jason Roy and Venkatesh Iyer, before the CSK spin attack even came into the game.  Kolkata looked in trouble at 33-3, but the left-handed pair Rinku and Rana put on a hall of fame display on how to play spin at Chepauk with a 99-run partnership to take their side home with nine balls to spare.  IMAGE: Rinku Singh celebrates his half century. Photograph: BCCI  Rana remained unbeaten with 57 off 44 balls while Rinku scored a 43-ball 54. This was the highest fourth wicket partnership in the IPL at the M A Chidambaram stadium.  The match will be remembered for RR's outstanding performance, which showcased how to play spin in challenging conditions and keep the pressure on a formidable opponent.  IMAGE: Nitish Rana slammed the winning runs. Photograph: BCCI  Initially, Rinku was the aggressor, but Rana picked up pace and extinguished any hope of CSK defending the total. Rana made the most of a dropped catch on 18 by Matheesha Pathirana in the deep to reach his fifty and stood firm to hit the winning runs.  Rinku, who became an IPL sensation with his five sixes off the last five balls against the Gujarat Titans to conjure up a miracle win for Kolkata last month, struck another fifty of the season before being run out. He was eventually awarded the player of the match."
