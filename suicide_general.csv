KENYA STARVATION CULT: DOZENS OF BODIES RECOVERED ON CULT LEADER'S LAND  Katana has been helping authorities investigate the cult and has provided shocking details about its operation, including an interview with the Sunday Times in which he described abuses of children such as forcing them to be locked inside huts for days without food or water.

Commission chairperson Leena Gangopadhyay told PTI it has spoken to all concerned, including the complainant – a woman student residing in a state-run Kazi Nazrul University hostel near Asansol on Saturday. The members of the commission recommended to the police that all the points referred to in the woman's complaint, including the alleged life threat sent to her by the accused via SMS, be examined.

""Apart from our members who had met her personally, I have interacted with her more than once over the phone and heard her views.

Gujarat BJP MP Rajesh Chudasama. (File Photo)  As per the complaint lodged by Chag’s son Hitarth Chag at Veraval police station, his father had lent about ₹1.5 crore to ₹1.75 crore to Naran Chudasama who wanted it for his business. On being asked to return the money, Chudasama and his son refused to do so and had threatened to kill the complainant and his father, as per the complaint. HT has seen a copy of the FIR.  The FIR is filed under IPC Sections 306 (abetment to suicide), 506(2) (criminal intimidation), and 114 (abettor present when offence is committed).  Dr Chag, 59, who is also a philanthropist in the coastal town of Veraval, was found hanging at his residence with a suicide note beside him on February 12.  The one-line suicide note written in Gujarati blamed Rajesh Chudasama and Naran Chudasama for his death. Hitarth alleged that the names mentioned in the suicide note are Rajesh Chudasama, the BJP MP from Junagadh-Gir Somnath and Naran Chudasama is his father.  On February 17, Hitarth lodged a complaint with Veraval police, demanding that the MP and his father be held accountable for his father’s suicide.  As the police did not immediately register an FIR against the MP and his father based on Hitarth’s application, he approached the Gujarat high court in March.  In his plea he alleged that police had acted in contempt of the Supreme Court’s Lalita Kumari judgment by refusing to lodge an FIR in the case. The SC judgment lays guidelines for registering FIRs in cognizable offences and prescribes a time-bound inquiry for non-cognizable ones.  The petition was disposed of by the court earlier this month on the grounds that the appropriate forum should address the grievance."

The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said. (Representational Image/Getty Images)  Police said that the student was depressed after learning of her poor performance in the board exams, the result for which was announced on Friday. Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) GS Sidhu said that the student had left a suicide note saying she was upset over the result and had walked out of her home on Friday. Police did not clarify how far away the drain was from the victim’s house, but said it was in the same neighbourhood.  “We have not found any foul play behind the death so far,” the officer added.  The victim lived with her parents in Nithari village of Aman Vihar. On Friday, the Class 12 results were announced and she learnt that she will have to appear for compartment exams in two subjects, the officer said.  DCP Sidhu said that the girl was dejected. Her parents said that around 3.30pm, she quietly walked out of her home and it was only later that they discovered the suicide note written by her, after which they approached the police at around 9.30pm, police said.  “We launched an extensive search operation to find her. We also took all other legal steps to trace her by informing the police control room (PCR) and flashed wireless messages to all the station house officers in Delhi and all the deputy commissioners of police by describing the student. The details of the missing girl were also uploaded on Zonal Integrated Police Network (ZIPNet) but we got no response,” said the officer.  On Sunday morning, police received a call about the partly submerged body of a girl being found in a drain. “The body was taken out from the drain with the help of locals and shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital. She was soon identified as the missing victim by her father,” said the DCP.  Since there was no indication of foul play, the police initiated proceedings under the CrPC instead of registering an FIR.  This is the third known case of a student dying by suicide in the Capital due to performance issues in the Class 12 board exam since Friday. In the first instance, a 19-year-old woman student died in outer Delhi’s Sultanpuri after failing. In the second case, a 16-year-old girl in west Delhi’s Hari Nagar hanged herself to death after scoring 75%, which was lesser than what she had hoped.

The charity has temporarily removed mascot Pudsey’s eye covering to show “not all of the challenges that children and young people may be facing are visible”, the broadcaster said.  The campaign encourages conversations between children and parents, carers and other trusted adults “to ensure no child faces their emotional and mental health challenges alone”.  Behind The Bandana ambassador Dr Alex George (BBC/PA)  Former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George, who has campaigned for better mental health after the death of his 19-year-old brother Llyr by suicide in 2020, has been named Behind The Bandana ambassador.  He said: “I know how important early intervention is in helping make a difference to the emotional wellbeing of children and young people and so I am very proud to be the ambassador of such a powerful campaign that really shines a light on the mental health crisis we are facing.  “As highlighted by Pudsey bear himself, mental health issues can be less visible on the outside, but conversations and positive relationships really can help.”  As part of the campaign, Children In Need has released the findings of a new Censuswide survey shedding light on how comfortable children feel when asking for help with their feelings and how often they feel the need to put on their “metaphorical bandana” and hide their emotions.  While nine in 10 parents surveyed said they talk to their child about their mental health at least once a month, more than a quarter of young people surveyed said they had not talked to someone they trust about their mental health in the last six months.  Children In Need’s boss Simon Antrobus said: “This research is a clear indication that our Behind The Bandana campaign is urgently needed.  “What’s also clear is that we can all play a role in addressing early signs of worry and anxiety by showing children and young people that we’re here to listen and to support them.  “By recognising and acknowledging that some feelings of worry and anxiety can be hidden means early conversations, sensitively delivered with kindness and empathy, can make a real difference to a child’s wellbeing and can help prevent mental health problems from becoming embedded.”"

Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney at just 17 to chase a contract in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns throughout a rollercoaster career that almost broke him in more ways than one.  The 28-year-old spent seasons on the sidelines battling a foot injury that left his chances of running again uncertain and his playing career in freefall.  A product of a tough upbringing, Brown struggled when he moved to Australia and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide.  While playing with Cronulla at age 19, Brown says he felt isolated and disconnected from everyone.  Bulldogs backrower Fa'amanu Brown pictured with his mother who passed away in 2020  Brown, who moved from Christchurch to Sydney to play in the NRL, has battled injuries and mental health concerns that almost broke him in more ways than one  'I went and signed papers at Cronulla Leagues Club … and I was, like, 'Man, I'm done. I want to go home or else I'm going to commit suicide',' he told ABC News.  And one night when the pressure became unbearable, Brown swam out into the ocean as far he could.  'God, if you're going to take me, take me now because, man, I'm done,' he recalled thinking at the time.  'But, for some reason, I floated on my back, swimming backwards back to the shore … I remember just crying,' he said.  Brown spoke to his mother afterwards and she encouraged him to be strong.  The young footy star started earning big bucks with the Sharks, but without proper guidance Brown soon developed a gambling problem.  'I ended up becoming broke. I went through a gambling phase. There was a point where I had to ask [the club to be paid] in an advance,' he admits.  It was his mother's cancer diagnosis that finally made him pull himself together and became the defining moment of his life.  Brown struggled when he moved to Australia to play footy and dealt with depression, a loss of identity, gambling problems and even almost attempted suicide  Brown (pictured with his partner) started earning a large wage with the Sharks, but without proper guidance the youngster soon developed a gambling problem  'There was a time where Mum was going to be put into a rest home, where people look after them until they pass, or we had an option where me and my brothers look after our mum,' he explained.  Brown thought a care home would be the best idea, but his brothers talked him out of it.  'But my brothers know the Samoan way more than me … My older brothers said: 'Trust me, you'll understand once you start looking after her.'  'This beats my NRL debut, making whatever money … I don't think getting married will top this.'  In a social media post from 2020, the footy star detailed how he was feeling while looking after his dying mother.  Brown says his mother's cancer diagnosis pulled him together and became the defining moment of his life  Brown thought about putting his mum in a care facility for her final days, but was glad he spent the time with her instead  'What I've learnt through my relationship with mum is there's no point in holding grudges towards others,' he wrote.  'Life is too short to darken your heart. Every time you say goodbye to your loved ones that could be the last time you will hear or see them. Now she is sick, I regret so many things.  'I should've would've could've but i know it's made me who i am today. Realise before it's too late.  'Everyday embrace your loved ones. Tell them you love them. Say it sincerely. Record memories. Be present. Say sorry. Talk it out. Continue to love & forgive even when it hurts.'"
