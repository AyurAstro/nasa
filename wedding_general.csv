You should measure your finger in two or three places depending on the size, and compare the measurements with a chart to find your ring size. You should also take into account the width and shape of the ring, as they can affect how it fits on your finger.  2. What shape do you prefer?

Last week, Skims expanded into bridal with 63 styles of dresses, lingerie, shapewear and loungewear, with some of its best sellers updated in white, baby blue and pink.  At first glance, a shapewear brand expanding into bridal may seem random, but it’s a common move for many intimates brands. Savage X Fenty and Victoria’s Secret, two of Skims’s competitors, both have bridal shops.  According to Jackie Avrumson, a bridal stylist and consultant of 20 years, clients respond favorably to such expansions. “Everything is white and ivory and lacy, and it’s their time to wear these pieces in those colors,” she said. “It just keeps them feeling like a bride throughout their entire experience.”"

She sipped smoothies and distributed bloat pills, as commenters suggested she was promoting unhealthy eating.  Advertisement  On Thursday, health and nutrition influencer Sam Cutler shared a ""what I ate on my wedding day"" video on TikTok, which chronicled her fastidiously healthful wedding in Boca Raton earlier this month as a gluten and dairy-free bride.  The clip, which has been viewed 4.5 million times, has sparked fierce backlash on the app, with many commenters disgracing Cutler for what they believed was promoting unhealthy eating habits.  The video begins with Cutler, who creates content under the moniker The Fit Fatale, sipping two different smoothies and being fed a grain salad by her maid of honor in the makeup chair. At the party, she notes a bottle of Arrae bloat pills have been distributed to guests, and says her chocolate wedding cake is ""gluten, dairy, and sugar-free.""  Cutler, 31, told Insider she had no idea the video would cause such a stir, given how similar it is to the rest of her content. Commenters were not only offended — some seemed angry.  ""So you forced your ED on all your guests and bridesmaids,"" a commenter wrote. She's now being called ""an almond mom,"" a term popularized on TikTok to describe adults with restrictive eating habits, and her ceremony, ""an almond wedding.""  Advertisement  The comments were ""low, hurtful, and harmful,"" the influencer said  Roughly nine years ago, the Toronto resident quit her corporate job to become a creator. She began documenting her journey to ""rebuild"" her heath in the face of several issues that arose in her twenties, including chronic bloating and adult acne.  She also endured a serious fall from a pilates class.  ""I was bedridden for about three months and really dove into trying to heal my gut and my brain at the same time,"" she said.  Nevertheless, as the video blew up over the weekend, it resulted in a spew of what Cutler called ""bullying and harassment.""  Many top commenters argued that a wedding marks a prime opportunity for indulgence and that Cutler was depriving her guests. Some went as far to say that she would be a terrible mother.  Advertisement  ""LMFAO i cannot imagine having an eating disorder themed wedding,"" reads one of the video's top comments, with 20,000 upvotes.  Cutler responded to this jab in a separate video, saying it was ""extremely low, hurtful, and harmful"" to label or diagnose someone who could possibly have mental health or body image issues.  ""If somebody is actually suffering, I think that that makes them feel more isolated,"" she told Insider.  Cutler said she didn't force guests to adhere to her diet  If anything, Cutler's intention was to inspire people with food intolerances to incorporate healthy habits when celebrating special occasions, she said.  ""I've never actually had anyone comment or attack me for eating disorders or promoting that in any way, shape, or form until this video,"" she said. Cutler added she has never been diagnosed with any type of eating disorder.  Advertisement  The creator believes some of the furor boils down to the mistaken notion that she forced her guests to hew to her diet. But guests had choices and ate standard fare, and many said it was some of the best wedding food they'd ever had, she said.  ""There was regular bread, we had multiple entree options that everyone was allowed to choose from at their table,"" she said. ""We had a lavish, top-shelf open bar.""  The bloat pills were optional too — stemming from a sponsorship with supplement brand Arrae, a longtime partner. (""Weddings are a really expensive time,"" Cutler said. ""If there's something you love and you can limit cost in any way, I think all the power to it."")  At the end of the day, Cutler stands by the video and says she's confident in knowing what works best for her body.  ""I'm not going to eat gluten and feel sick because it will make someone else comfortable,"" she said. ""I think the real conversation here is around removing food-shaming from social platforms … Everyone should be making the choices that work for them."""

Chad Andrew “Drew” Kelly Jr. was known for his love of serving the town of Moncks Corner. But his life was cut short after he was killed in an “accident,” according to an online obituary.  Kelly died May 12, less than two months after he was married. He and his wife were “enjoying their new life together” before his death, a post on the Russell Funeral Chapel website said.  “Please keep the Kelly family and the Town of Moncks Corner Fire Department in your thoughts and prayers over the next several weeks. One cannot imagine the pain and loss both families are feeling,” the Moncks Corner Rural Fire Department wrote in a Facebook post.  Over the years, Kelly had served with that department and also worked as an engineer/EMT with the town of Mocks Corner, officials said.  “Drew’s passion in life was fighting fires and serving his community,” his obituary said. “He was 2021 Firefighter of the Year for the town of Moncks Corner.”  Kelly was also remembered for being a member of his church and for having a “beloved dog.” After Kelly’s death, several people flocked to social media to share their condolences.  “This loss is particularly painful for many,” the fire department said, noting that the news resonated across the Moncks Corner area.  Moncks Corner is in Berkeley County, roughly 30 miles northwest of Charleston.  Moncks Corner and the Rural Fire Department didn’t immediately share additional details with McClatchy News on May 15.

In an cover story interview with Glamour UK on Monday, the ""Let You Love Me"" singer opened up about the planning behind her top-secret wedding to the filmmaker, 47.  ""[The wedding was planned] in two to three days, when I was out of cycle, which is what I call it when I'm not in album cycle mode,"" the 32-year-old singer told the outlet. ""His kids were there, and I really wanted them to be a part of it. It was either then or we had to wait for ages.""  She continued, ""I didn't want to do it without my stepkids there. So, we just figured it out, and we did it. And it was perfect.""  Rita Ora and Taika Waititi.

Her parents were on Zoom.  ""It was a dream,"" she said.  Ora — who publicly confirmed the marriage in January — also elaborated on her decision to keep the wedding private.

I had a moment of reality recently, where I realized all the stress and anxiety I had in my twenties – I survived it,"" she said. ""Not being swayed or convinced or second guessing myself.

The Bachelor alum and Coming Out Colton star, 31, wed Jordan C. Brown, 38, in front of 200 guests in a romantic ceremony at the Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley on Saturday.  The three-day affair, planned by Ashley Smith Events, kicked off with a family dinner and welcome party on Friday night, before a full day of wedding festivities began Saturday morning.  ""The day of our ceremony, we have a disco-themed pool party,"" Underwood told PEOPLE in an exclusive interview ahead of the couple's big day. ""It's going to be a fun wedding,"" he adds, ""I'll say that!""  For their nuptials, the couple wore custom Tom Ford suits.

As guests made their way to the ceremony where a choir and orchestra performed, they were greeted by a beautiful photo display designed by the couple.

""It's inspired from a coffee table book that I was gifted after I came out called Loving and it's images of men in love throughout history.

""Next to them will be love letters from queer people in the 18th and 19th century that were forbidden or they had to send in secret.""  Olivia Rae James  Adds Brown: ""It's really cool.
